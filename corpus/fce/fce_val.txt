dear manager , 
dear manager , 
during my stay in london i went to your circle theatre to see the musical 'over the rainbow' . in the advertisment you promised a perfect evening out , but it wasn't . so with this letter i want to ask for some money back . now i want to explain the problems . it was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't danny brook , how it was told in the advertisment . it was also told that the evening shows are starting 19 . 30 , but it started 20 . 15 . i had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available . after the show i wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends , but it was closed because of illness . so i want to ask for my money back , also because i had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisment . i hope you will answer my letter and correct the problems in your theatre .

at first you have to define what is meant by 'modern technology' . for me modern technology are things like personal computers , mobile phones , keyboards , video recorders , hifi sound systems , television or even cars . but are they are usefull in every situation and everywhere ? my oppinion is that modern technology can help you to save time . in my case for example my car is very time-saving . if i want to go to training i need not wait for the bus , and so i need not start one and a half hour before training i start a half hour before . so i save one hour , which i can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else . the same problem with mobile phones , if i got one i needn't go to the public phones , i save time . if i got internet i can send e-mails , i needn't go to the letter box , i save time . in my daily life i can save time , but i think every body should use his saved time for things like hiking , walking , swimming , for a " natural life " and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots . we should also move our body and not only use our brain .

i recently visited your theatre to see the musical show " over the rainbow " . i was very disappointed because the actors wasn't danny brook and tina truelove . instead of them you had different actors . then the show delayed , it started at 20:15 , not at 19 . 30 . i had to wait 45 minutes ! another point is that the discounts wasn't available although i could red it before at your notice .

how has modern technology changed your daily life ? 
modern technology has changed my daily life in the point that all i do is becoming more comfortable . for example when i have to write a letter or do my homework , i always write it on the computer . if i search something like a telefonnumber or an adress i also look it up from the internet . i use also the internet when i need any informations for example i need them for school or private for myself . a few years ago i had to go in a library and look it up in many books . most that took a long time .

another important point for me is that things like listening music or watching tv sounds better and the pictures on tv are being impoved , because the machines become more better . and also a good intention for me is the handy , because everywhere i go i can talk to other people .

dear manager of the circle theatre , 
dear manager of the circle theatre , 
last night , i cam to your musical show , " over the rainbow " and i was very disappointed because it wasn't what you writed in your advertisement . for example , your advertisement said that the starring were danny brook and tina truelove , but at the show they were not them ! they were kevin starr and jessica richmond . for me , this a big mistake . this event was not the only one because another problem was the respect of the time . your advertisement said that the show will start at 19:30 pm , but it has started at 20:15 pm . i don't like to have such big change in time . the third problem was that it was writting that the discounts were available , but when i get there it was not true . the fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show , but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation . after that , i can tell you that i spend the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied about " you will have a perfect evening ! " after all these explanations , i am sure that you will understand that i would like to have my money back and that i was disappointed last night . so i wish to hear soon about you .

how has modern technology changed your daily life ? 
modern technology , such as computer , car and other else , changed my life in many different ways like communication , traveling and working . for example , a car , which is used from everyone everyday , changed my daily life in the sens that i don't need my dad or my mum to go to ice-skating or to go to work . i can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of the technology , but because i can show that i am responsable . with this car i can see the world , not exactly , but i can travel and visit other countries that switzerland .

another technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it like homeworks , works , photos , but the most important at my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world by the web . this a big walk in the technology and i can say that it is the most important for me because i like to have a lot of friends . so i spend almost one hour every day on the web . at last technology that i would like to bring out is the tv . this is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on earth . naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen , for example a special plate or else , and i could talk a lot about them , but i think that the one here are the most important in the change of my daily life .

another point is the time when it started , exactly 45 minutes later . a serious theatre can't miss such an important thing , the starting-time . i had to wait all that time in the street , because the hall was not big enough . moreover , once i was going to pay for the tickets , i found another thing : there were no discounts avaible . in your advertisement you informed us about their false existence .

before modern technologies arrived , you couldn't communicate as easily as we can do today . 
an example could be the internet . it changed my life , because with it i can discover more information than a newspaper , and also information of all around the world , that possibly never i can access without internet . but , is not only news or information . you can comunicate with people from place were you never can imagine to have a trip because it will be too expensive . an extract could be the popular chats , where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell . but , if you don't like to use the keyboard to tell something or comunicate , you can use video conference , a sistem wich you can talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers . also is the possibility of download things to your pc like software , pictures and also , music . the modern technologies make me able to listen the music i've downloaded with the same quality as a cd , and if i buy a reproductor , i can wear this music to everywere .

also computers and mobile phones had evolutioned thanks to modern technologies . without this evolution , we probably still get on the ancient times . who wants to return to the ancient times ? no electricity , no canalized water , no healthy water , no tv's , no phones , no pc's . . i'm afraid that the people on the ancient times lived although they don't have anything of these things , but me and everyone of this times , i'm afraid that we wouldn't like return to this life . as well , i think that modern technologies are necessary , but also i think that are so expensive , but with time , the price goes down . so , if the price goes down is because anything new is at the moment for sell . is like a round tour .

however , something wrong came up again . the actor 'danny brook' , whom you advertised in the brocher , did not play a part in the show . and i really disappointed from the different actor's performance . he kept forgetting his lines . finally , i went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after show , but it was closed because it was refurbishing interior . i am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from advertisement .

it's comletely different !

these days , new designs and new trends are coming out every day , sometimes we are shocked by them in comparison with the days we were young . however , it doesn't seem to take long for most of young people to get used to it , so we can imagine what clothes will be like in the future .

in my opinion , i believe that clothes indicate individual's creativity as well as social situation . we never know whether we might look like robots because it will be the electronic age . on the other hand , some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefre to wear nothing .

dear manager: i am angela ounis and i am writting to you because i went to see 'over the rainbow' , london's newest and best musical show . i am very disappointing at this evening's show . first of all the starring that was supposed to be ( danny brook and tina truelove ) weren't there , i was so enthusiastic about your starring , when i realized was a failure , even though they do good , it wasn't the same . i arrived there , at 19:15 , the show was supposed to start at 19 . 30 , but started at 20:15 , it cannot be possible that a schedule for a show have had a big change . you go there to see a show and have a good time , not to wait forever until you want . also was said that discounts will be available , but i didn't received any discount as you were cheating us . i know that you have a big responsability but if you told something to people , do it . on the other hand , the theatre restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization . that was so uncomfortable , people was starving . i am so disappointed with this , that i am in all my right to ask for some money back , your theatre show wasn't expected . please let me know . sincerely yours

first of all my cousin , who lives there , had had many problems with the tickets . the starring changed and this was the worst surprise i could have . my greatest wish was seeing danny brook's performance; you know it's the best singer . but instead of him there was a unknown young actor . what a pity , i thought .

i arrived there in time , 19:15 in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30 , but i had to wait until 20 . 15 . what an absurd thing , don't you think so ? the quality of the show wasn't as high as i expected . i hadn't tought for a restaurant to go to after the show , because if the advertisement had been right , there should had to be a luxury restaurant where i could eat . but it was closed because it was under construction .

because of the quality of the evening i spent , the only thing you can do is giving me back at least the half of the cost of ticket . to apologise and give the impression of being a serious theatre . i'd rather i had been at home seeing on tv my italy !

unfortunately , pat was not very good at keeping secrets . this was like an illness for him . so many time he was told: " pat i say this secret only to you " . pat could stand this secret only few days , after the secret come from the deep inside , and had to be said . this was terrible for his friendship : he always lost his friends . he wanted to die for this . the worst thing is that he could not improve this behaviour . one day the fortune helped our poor pat . on the bus he saw a robber while he was stealing a wallet , he wanted to scream , but he was astonished . when the robber understood he could be discovered he said " if you don't keep the secret i will kill you " . pat , as he always did , couldn't keep the secret , even if he was scared . eventually the robber was caught by the police , and for his brave and honesty he had a lot of friends .

dear sir , i'm writing to express my complaint about the organization of the musical show i went to last saturday evening . according to your advertisement , there should have been danny brook , starring all the scenes . instead , you changed actor without any warning , so i didn't find my favourite danny brook , with my total disappointment , as his substitute couldn't catch him up at all . and what about the starting time ? i had to wait for about an hour , as the show started at 20 . 15 instead of 19 . 30 . another thing that made me angry was that i couldn't have a discount . i was very annoyed about it: i only expected the discounts you had promised on the advertisement and , as i am a university student , i would have a right on it . at the top of everything , your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructurated , so i couldn't have my dinner either ! it was a terrible evening out , so i ask you for a refund for all the troubles you caused me . yours sincerely ,

i moved away that year , away to a whole new place and a whole new school . once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together , just like the old times . however i felt i could not talk to them about the problems i was having , the one problem about my parents getting a divorce .

when my parents told me the news , i was stunned , dazed . my dad began packing his things the very next day , to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them . that period of my life was one of the worst . i went into a depression , and not matter who tried to make me feel better , i only felt worse .

however , the person who helped me through this hard time was , surprisingly , pat . she showed up on my doorstep just when i was having one of my worst days . she told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help . when she was comforting me i noticed she had changed . she was a person i could turn to , i could trust . she let me pour out my feelings , a thing i did not do to anyone . ever since , she gained my trust and told her my feelings and secrets . unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul . she kept every single one of my secrets well , and not surprisingly , she became my best friend . eventually , i got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal , happy teenager .

i'm writing to complain about the show that i recently attended at your theatre . during my visit there some problems occurred that made my evening completely disappointing . 
firstly , as i wanted to buy a ticket , i was informed that no discounts were available . however , the serious problems appeared later . not only the play started 45 minutes after it was planned , but as the actors eventually appeared at the stage , have i also seen , that danny brook was replaced by a different actor , who was very disappointing in his role . to make matters even worse , the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , without any information given about the reason of it's closure .

in my opinion , if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes . what is more , ground will be so hot , that going will only be possible in huge shoes , which should be massive , but not heavy at all . another effect of the scorching weather could be , that people won't be allowed to get out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats , made of materials , that aren't known yet .

modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship and the ways to comunicate to other people as well as our life expectancy . with the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access internet to comunicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from ourselves . despite of the distances , we can keep our friendship closely and with a cheaply way . besides of this , the information goes faster than it used to know and it's avaiable in the same time to every part of the world . on the one hand , our time is taken to learn how to deal with the new technologies . on the other hand , we can feel more comfortable with them providing us support to our hard tasks and letting us free to apply our attention and efforts to more important things . for instance , we can research new manners of improving our quality of life . in conclusion , we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware about how they are introduced in our lives to avoid the dangerous side of the technology .

as we can understand by observing the fashion of each century , the style of dressing changes radically over the years . so we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be 100 years from now
in my opinion , there are two possible fashions for the future . if humans turn to be more free from social rules , i think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited . there will be a variety of colours and fashion styles . everybody will wear anything he/she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange . on the other hand , if human society turns to be stricher and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of the society . all people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around . perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too .

i am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has put on recently , and , i want you to know , it has really disappointed me . 
to begin with , the actor the advertisement showed did not come , which i found it in very bad taste , disappointing . moreover , the show started at a quarter past eight , forty-five minutes later than it might have been . i paid twenty pounds for my ticket because , as you may know , there were not discounts available . it is for this reason , i think you should return me some money back .

i'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by circle theatre last tuesday . in fact it was quite different from the one i had expected to see . first of all , danny brook wasn't the leading actor , though his name was printed on the brochure . i had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages , so as soon as i realized there was a substitute on the stage , i was really disappointed .

i was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19 . 30 , too . considering that i had to buy a full-price ticket ( even if i had read on the brochure that discounts would be available ) , i think you can understand my anger . i suggest you should solve these problems quickly . if i were you , i should keep open the theatre restaurant , because i heard people saying it was a pity it was closed .

i think people don't realize how much technology rules their life . neither do i . in particular i'd like to talk about internet . i think that internet has changed my daily life most of all . in fact , now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries , for exemple in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing . therefore i regard internet as a quite powerful tool and i believe it has given more strenght to relations among people . in fact people meet on the net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net .

what will clothes be like 100 years from now ? what do you think modles will wear in cat walks ? will they wear anything ? who know ? nowaday , people look at fashion-magesins or get opinions from their friends to decide what to wear in different occasions 
what will clothes be like 100 years from now ? what do you think models will wear on the catwalks ? will they wear anything ? who knows ? nowadays , people look at fashion-magazines fashion magazines or get opinions from their friends to help them to decide what to wear on different occasions . 
will they still do the same 100 years later ? 
will they still do the same 100 years from now ? 
in my opinion , i think clothes will be a lot differente 100 years later compare to now . as new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves which leads to changes in fashion but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans , which was invented ages ago in america . and people nowadays still use jeans as a common material . if you walk out to the street now , you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans which is incredibly surprising ! 
in my opinion , clothes will be a lot different in 100 years' time . new materials will be invented and new styles will be created either by designers or people themselves , which lead will lead to changes in fashion , but in addition materials will probably still be used such as denim , which was invented ages ago in america . and people nowadays still use denim as a common material . if you walk out on to the street now , you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made of denim , which is incredibly surprising ! 
from my point of view , i think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular . as people are wearing thinner and thinner clothings to show off their figure they might as well just wear clothes that are see through to give it a better effect ! so if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 year later , the only thing you can do is to wait !

yesterday i went to the play called " over the rainbow " , for which i saw the advertisement in today's guardian . i want to tell you that i am very disappointed about the play . 
in the advirtisement it is written that danny brook was in the starring . however i didn't see him all the night . there was another actor instead of him . and also it should be started at 19 . 30 , as i saw in the advirtisement , which has started at 20 . 15 ! and so far there wasn't any discounts available which is written to be " available " in the advirtisement . i went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the re-decoration progress inside . you should have written it in the advirtisement . and after all no one can say that i had a perfect evening out ! absolutely it was very dissapointing . so i want my money back .

i'd like to complain about your ' best ' musical show , which i went to when i had a week's holiday in london . i felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement weren't true . 
i went there at 19 . 00 because the show started at 19 . 30 as the advertisement said but i queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down . finally , after an hour , when my term came to buy the entrance ticket , you staff said i couldn't have a discount and so as anyone . however i bought the ticket even it was more expensive because i'd been queuing for ages and i really wanted to see my favourite idol , danny brook .

but when the show started , they said danny wasn't there because of his illness and i felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation i had was unlike what the advertisement said . after the boring show finished , i was hungry and i decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19 . 00 . so what's the point to say 'visit our restaurant after the show' ?

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . he went to see the headmaster and told him all the truth . tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane to the headmaster and jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster after he punished jon . the headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment , which was suspended from school for a week .

this happened in the thursday afternoon . when everyone finished their lunch , they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every thursday . but some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board . unfortunately , one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head . everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger . he then punished jon but the one who did was tim so jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster among us . pat heard that and went to see the headmaster straight after school . the headmaster went to see jon and tim and punished their bad behaviours .

plus , i felt very pleased when i heard that danny brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in highschool and perchance i have found him back here ! you can believe i was very disappointed when i saw that he actually was not playing and i was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it ! how rude !

moreover ; it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19 . 30; it actually started at exactly 20 . 15 ! 45 minutes latter : where we had nothing to do , but waiting . we couldn't even have a drink , because , obviously , the restaurant you talked about was closed !

really , what a mess in the administration . although , i would have felt better if i had had a discount on my ticket , as you mentionned in the advertisement , but unfortunately , these couldn't possibly be reached either ! i am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back , so you do not lose a faithful client .

madrid , 17 - june - 2000 dear sir/madam , my name is . . . . i am working as an actor for the spanish royal theatre . i had spent the hole last week in london with one of my colleagues . sunday night we went to your theatre . we thought that going to the musical show " over the rainbow " was ( as you say in your advertisement ) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city . but from the beginning we found a lot of problems . despite we are actors we had to pay a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on sundays . we tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite . however , we decided to get into the show . danny brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise . you can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not danny , but peter fox , who was on the stage . nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant , where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out . i am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late . as you can read it was not our " perfect evening out " at all . i was really disappointed . i realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but i have to ask you the money of the tickets back . next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement , before the starting time of the show . i am waiting your answer ,

my girlfriend and i read an advertisement about the show " over the rainbow " which is very popular . she is fond of the actor danny brook so i decided to buy two tickets , provided there were discounts available . when we asked for discounts tickets , we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not english students . we were annoyed about it but we paid off . we took our places , and began chatting with other people . we had to wait 8 . 15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9 . 30 pm ! moreover , we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of danny brook . my girlfriend was very upset and so was i .

after that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed . finally we had the worst evening i have ever imagined , it was definitely not the " perfect evening " as written in the adverstiment .

how interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now . fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true . but let's see my point of view . in a hundred years , clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours . materials , textures and colours change , and are minds too .

so i think people will wear clothes made of recycled things , like bottles of aluminium . and i hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see .

i think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans . syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on . but maybe the shape of the clothes will changed : large pants as " baggy " , or trousers with many pockets as we see today . for women , clothes change more than for men's . it maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes . i guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt , or more male clothes because they want to change . finally it's very difficult to say that .

i've recently visited london for holidays and during my stay i went to your theatre to see the musical show " over the rainbow " . i am really sorry to say that i am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical , starting from the advertisement . firstly , in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be danny brook . an actor that i admire and i wanted to see him performing . unfortunately instead of brook i saw another actor , totally stranger to me . secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30 , but the theatre started at 20:15 . i don't want to be rude , but this is not proffessional at all . another thing i would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets .

the first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer . i spend most of my time in front of the computer , either working or playing . of course this sometimes is an advantage , when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier , but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends . but unfortunately i cannot live without a computer . the first thing i do in the morning is start up my computer , check if i have any new e-mails , check my electronic calendar and then go to work , where i always work with a computer . the computer has become my second nature .

in conclusion i would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things , some of them are good and some others are not so good . it's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way , and make our lives easier . the only thing i really support is that if you know how to use technology is a benefit for you . if you don't is going to destroy you .

definately the worse . he started to " sell " the secrets of anna to all the boys of the school who were interested in her . all the boys of the class went to pat to know what anna was doing in every moment , and pat was becoming ' friend ' of all the boys . 
definitely the worse . he started to " sell " anna's secrets to all the boys in the school who were interested in her . all the boys in the class went to pat to find out what anna was doing at every moment , and pat was becoming ' friends ' with all the boys .

finally , pat didn't have any friends , because he didn't have anything about anna to sell . 
is it moral , to get some friends destroying and hurting another people ? i think no ! and you ?

we know that everything is changing . and of course the technology is also changing . not so long ago we had to do many things by our hand , but now there re a lot of machines to do the same . and it makes our life easier . now we have free time to do anything else , while machine is doing our work . it's connected with our house , our workplace and e . t . c .

for example , earlier i used to wash my clothes by hand , but now i have the last version of wash machine and now there are no any reasons to do it by hand . earlier it took me 3 hours , but now it is my free time and i can go for a walk with my friends .

another example is that earlier we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy . now we have a scanner and a printer to do it . and it takes bout 1 minute to make a copy but not 1 hour .

i have recently been to the circle theatre and watched the musical show - over the rainbow . i am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which was published in the newspaper . 
according to the advert , it says clearly that discounts are available , but when i was buying the tickets , i did not have this offer . as a result , i had to pay the full price of £15 . the second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes . although i believe there must have been problems , i expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way . apart from that , the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of danny brook and tina truelove , for whom i was coming . after the show we went to the theatre restaurant , but it was closed due to the refurbishment .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . my story had already been spread out the next day . although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal , it was awful that people kept mentioning it . i thought i was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustful . but this idea was soon be put off since i noticed on the newspaper that i had won the writing competition . i couldn't believe my luck , i was really sure that i won a return ticket to the meditarenian sea . during the trip , i made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns . they were so kind to me that we soon became good friends . the last few days , we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping . i must admit that it was the greatest time i have ever had in my life . on the last day when i was packing and getting ready to leave , i realised i had lost my passport and tickets . a horrible thought suddenly came into my mind . my bad luck had never left me . it had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance , it was going to give me a 'surprise' .

during these past few decades , or rather in the 20th century , there has been a great deal of development in modern technology . 
one of the essential developement is the form of transportation . the invention of cars planes , trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time . this enables us to save great deal of time and effort . quite recently , in my country electrical bicycles have been invented . this compared to the traditional bicycle is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in small amount of time with hardly no effort at all . this has made my life easier . on the other hand , i feel as though i am becoming lazier and exercising less .

another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances . there are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves . what changed my life most is portal computers . they are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often . before i used computers generally , it took so much time for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information . with a computer however , all this is done in the matter of seconds . this again enables people to save time .

the old man and the sea - ernest hemingway
as i see it , the old man and the sea is a really exiting book . it describes a challenge , the challenge of life . the major characther is the old man who has to fight against the sea to keep alive . it could be his last adventure . this old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish something good . by surprise he comes across the biggest fish he has ever seen , a beautiful marlin . the man keeps immediatly in contact with it . they are going to be one thing linked together . they're fighting for the same reason with the same strenght , the man has to kill a brother , as he calls the fish . i think they're really brothers , they feel the same pain and fear during the battle .

if the marlin could speak it would have told the old man's same thing . when the old man won the fight he felt sorry but pleased . he respected and still loves it . but , afterwards , the life's rule is mors tua vita mea and that's the most difficulty to face to .

first of all , danny brook was not starring , even it was stated in your advertisement , but the main role was played by an unknown actor . secondly , i had to wait for forty five minutes for the show to start , and it was 20:15 ( not 19:30 ) when the curtain went up .

another disappointing thing was that i could not get any student discount , even that your advertisement promised them . to make things even worse , the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , because of the roof repairs .

i think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes . there will be mixture of styles from different times of the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one . a new technology and science will change fabrics , so they will change their colour during the day .

i recently had a week's holiday in london . during my stay , i went to the circle theatre to see your musical show called 'over the rainbow' . it was actually very disappointing and i have to say that i want my money back as you said 'your pefect evening' out in your advertisement and i rally do think it was not the perfect evening out .

here are the problems of your show . in your advertisement , it says that danny brook will act but he did not . it was a different actor and i was very disappointed . it says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late .

i passed one week in london and during my visit i had the fortune to visit " over the rainbow " in your theatre . but i was not very satisfied after my " perfect evening " out . the advertisement for the musical show was very good , but the information was not correct . you wrote that the favourite actor will be danny brook but there was another one who was really disappointing . in the advertisement was written that the show will start at 19 . 30 but it started 45 minutes later , at 20 . 15 ! because of the advertisement i thought that i can discount the tickets available but i couldn't . after the show i need to drink something in the theatre restaurant like the advertisement it concieved , but it was closed . and there was no reason why .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secretes . this was the only reason why that she had not a lot of friends . when pat came new into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems . but after a few time the others have seen that pat can't keep secrets . so they stopped nearly immediately to tell her something important . sometimes it finished like this that the others only said : " hello , how are you ? " and then went away without listening the answer . this made pat sad and she became very quiet . during the day she worked hard that she had not to think too much . but at night , when it became dark the dreams were coming . she dreamed about good friends , time that was long passed by and she dreamed from someone who she can tell her own secrets .

dear sir or madam , i recently went to the circle theatre in order to see over the rainbow , and it has been quite deceiving . i am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts . in the advertisement for the show , which i have picked up in the hall of the theatre , are there about five points which were not respected . to begin with , as far as the starring is concerned , danny brook should have performed the main character , and i saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not . insofar as i came here especially to see him play , i have been very deceived , and this could be the understatement of the year , inasmuch as he is my favorite actor . apart from it , the show should have begun at 19 . 30 and it started at 20:15 ! could you explain me the reasons of such a huge late ? thirdly , the ad mentionned possible discounts . personnaly speaking , i didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it : i have asked about it , but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts . on top of that , the restaurant was closed for renovations ! how can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed ? to put it in a nutshell , and quite honestly , i would like to emphasize on the fact that i did not spent a " perfect evening out " at all , as it is mentionned in the ad . for all these reasons , i would like , dear sir or madam , that you give me my money back . i am looking forward to hear from you . yours faithfully ,

first of all , i was really expecting to see danny brook , my favourite actor . however , he was not on the stage that day . secondally the show started late and i had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything . it was a waste of time . i also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact was not available and i had to pay for normal price . furthur more , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay . i had to go home without eating a dinner , though i was really hungry .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . pat and i have been friends for a long time . we have had a lot of fun together because we had the same interests . when we were 15 years old we decided to drive with my mother's car on a day when my parents were absent . i told pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know that . pat promised me to tell nobody about our purpose . two days later my father asked me whether i had thought at any time to drive a car without a drivers license because he had heard that from some parents of my friends at school . he told me two hours what could happen if i would do that . i was very surprised because pat and i were along when we decided to do that .

two days before , i told him that our father was about to buy a brand new car . and he did not want our mother to be informed . it was supposed to be a gift for twenty years of marriage . a car only for her . 
the first thing pat did was to tell our young sister the secret . and , less than five minutes later , our mother knew the whole thing . her reaction was not the one we were expecting . apparently she was not surprised , but she was surely angry . really angry ! ! she thought it was a stupid idea , and also an expensive one . according to her , this car would have been useless . she suspected our father to want to please himself .

first of all , the most important singer , danny brook , was not singing . you should have at least informed the public because most of the people came to see him . however the man who took his place made a good performance , we enjoy listening to him because his voice was amazing .

the times were not respected: the show began 45 minutes late . the children could not stand waiting outside in the cold . as it started later , it finished later and people missed the train they wanted to take . furthermore you did not apologise as if it was usual !

what was the reason ? pat used to show the test to his friend nick , when he had finished it to get his opinion . nick now had taken a copy of the test to archive it . and the girlfriend of nick happened to be in pat's class . she was quite clever and had known everything about this , so she had taken copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared .

in one hand scientist discovered a lot of medisent from different illneses , but in an enother hand they discovered many illneses about which we haven't herd before . i think this side of the question is balanced because before effect on our health was less than it is now . more and more people died from some illness wheres long time ago less people died from illneses , dispite that fact that they had less medisent .

however technology nowerdays impoved so much and it changed our life a lot . today we can't even think how we could possibly leave without computers or without airplanes . computer it is our way of with outside world comunicat , wheres with airplanes we can rich our parents , friends easily and much faster , then if we would use bouts or trains . everyday scientist and technologyst discover and produce more and more new things and it is good , it has to be like that , we have to do forword not behind from the point where we are now .

fashion: this term evokes top models , stylists , colours and the great european capital cities , like rome , london and paris . but it is nearly impossible to define it or to fix the rules within which it developes ; nowadays the fashion world includes ( and is created by ) stylists from all over the world , each one presenting a different model of beauty , sometimes one opposite from another . i think that fashion in the future will develope according to very different lines: there may be a return to the fashion of the past , as we can notice yet now , or a more fantascientific and technological developement . surely , ordinary people will not follow only the models presented on tv , as regards everyday life , i think that in the future attention will be focalized on comfortability more than on elegance . but if it is difficult to forecast the developements of the fashion world , it is nearly impossible to forecast those of the common people , that is a too various cathegory .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . . . . and when she knew that maria was going out with tim ( a classmate ) , she told it to everyone she met . in few days maria's father ( who is very jealous ) had heard the rumour . he asked maria if it was true and she couldn't lie . he got very angry and he didn't allow maria going out for a period of two weeks . maria talked to her father and tried to explain him that tim is a good person but her father says that she is too young to have a boyfriend .

it is said that the singers are danny brook and tina truelove in the advertisement . however , there was a different unknown actor in that . the show started later at 20:15 which was very different in '19 . 30' as shown . there was no discount at all which is in contrast with 'discounts availabe ' . after the show , i wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason .

if you asked the young people what they spend their money on most , most of them would answer 'clothes' . these days , new fashions pass by very quickly . 
from my point of view , young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin . for example , short skirts and tops like an under-wear . i think young people would wear smaller clothes which they look like almost naked even in winter . i suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick . it could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear , like skirts made of leaves .

i am writing to you to complain about the musical show , which where everything was completely different from the advertisement . 
firstly , i would like to say that i am very disappointed and upset with the show i saw . to begin my complains i can start with the actor - was a different one , not danny brook . tina truelove performed marvellous , but him i think he is a " street actor " from covent garden . even worse it was the delay , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , that drove me mad .

to begin with , i'd like to underline how the place of technology has increased since a couple of years . with the end of the second world war and the economic prosperity many goods like tv , washing-machine , etc . became cheaper and available . nowadays , the internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite seem to take the lead . do they affect my daily life ?

i have recently spent a week's holiday in london , and i have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and i would like to complain about a couple of things . 
first , i like to complain about the main features which is an actor , he might have been well known in england , but on the night , he performed abysmally . secondly a lot of people were not very impressed with the time , because all of us at least have to wait for almost an hour until the show start .

also , a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities which said to be serve in an advertisement . for example , the discount for the tickets were not available , and especially a lot of people were disappointed that they can not visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed , due to the cleaner forgotten to clean up the mess from the previous party .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . this feature didn't allow you to tell him much about yourself . he wasn't really wicked , he merely didn't understand to keep his mouth shut , especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called " private life " runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and didn't even know .

there is one point i want to make clear , i don't begrudge pat anything . i believe this is a rule of society , it's a sort of group behaviour , and belongs to the childhood and the teenage . we all speak or have spoken of our neighbours , family , classmates , workmates , friends in bad terms . that is only human .

according to me what is more to regret is when now we full-growns continue to act with this bad habit . the criticism spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets . what allows us to reveal parts of someone others privacy , nothing .

unfortunately , i had a terrible evening . at first i became worried because there wasn't any discounts available , like your advertisement say . and i became even more angry to have to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin . it's necessary to start on time , and your paper was informing that it would begin at 19:30 . it didn't happen .

to complete my sadness , the main actor was replaced by another one who i've never heard anything from , and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement do .

i'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which i saw last saturday . 
i went to london to see this musical but i was absolutely dissapointed about the show . i got to the theatre at 18:30 because i wanted to drink before i get to the hall so i got there earlier . the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 . it was about fourty five minutes later than original starting time . i was just a bit upset but i wasn't that upset much at that time . the thing which made me really upset was the actor . the actor should be danny brook but it was another man who i haven't seen before . i liked danny brook so much and i was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention about that actor was going to change to another guy . this thing shouldn't be happened .

i'm writing to you in order to complain about this show . the problems started when we arrived at the theatre: my 6 year old son had to pay full price . then , even if we could enter in the room , the show didn't start before 20:15 , which is 45 minutes later than expects . indeed , we are still waiting on danny brook who was not in the piece . and last , at the end of the program , we would like to have a drink in the theatre restaurant , but it was already closed due to the poor attendance .

in fact modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when i was born , so i cannot say that it changed my life rapidly . but i am also sure , that my life would be different without it . all these products of science are with me since the very beging of my day . for example i am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock , then i go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water , next i eat my breakfast and listen to the radio . all these things are the ideas of the technology .

i am writing to express my disappointment with the play " over the rainbow " , which is showing at the circle theatre . 
first of all , the advertisement for the show announced mr. danny brook as the principal actor . surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage , during the play . therefore , the theatre or the company is lying . secondly , the show started one hour fifteen past after . we arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began . finally , when i asked about the discounts , an agressive employee refused to answer me . he stayed looking at me and laughing . it was incredible . the evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from the promise written in the advertisement .

i'm writing to complain for the musical show " over the rainbow " . i've been recently seeing in your theatre during my week's holiday in london i must say i had a very disappointing evening ! i was sure this was the london's newest and best musical show i had ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but i thought completely wrong ! 
i'm writing to complain about the musical show " over the rainbow " . i recently saw this in your theatre during my week's holiday in london and i must say i had a very disappointing evening ! i was sure this was london's newest and best musical show , the best i would ever see , because of the good publicity you gave yourself in your advertisement , but i thought completely wrong ! 
firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as i expected ! if the spectacle has been beautiful , i would have been quite pleased to wait . then , i had read that there would have been discounts available , but it wasn't true ! so it's better not to write anything if you don't make it true then .

finally , i hoped that , after these incidents , i would enjoy myself , but there was another change of programme: starring ! the main actor , danny brook , was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as i expected . finished the show , i went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this hasn't been said before . moreover , i was shocked by the reason for which it was closed: the chef went away after he received a phone call !

there would be many things to say about . technology is a wide field which increases very quickly . it's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast . i'm not sure if i must say technology has changed our life in positive or not . certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago . nowadays , we make a phone call with an astonish rapidity , instead at my grandparents' time it took one month or more to have contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow ! when appeared the first car , it was already a great success . before that , people travelled by horse or worse . fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to america , australia or wherever else he wants ! what can i say about the television ? it allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which happened or will happen . in the not very far 1914 , parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead ! it's terrible !

despite this , i'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community , not only phisically . we pay less attention to our life , to those things which give us happiness , that aren't money , success , power .

modern technology has changed my daily life , making it easy , with less effort and time spent . a simple example , we can at the same time wash our clothes with a washing machine , record a tv program and talk to someone on the other side of the world . all this in one morning , and the day just begins , what doing next ?
