then , the actors ( danny brook and tina truelove ) who were mentioned and supposed to play weren't present . there were different actors who took the role .

the communication has made many progresses too . everyone gets a television at home . " a machine which talks and shows pictures !

nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents , or even our parents , were living in . actually , whereas they used to talk about how their daily life had changed in comparison with previous generations' , we remain astonished looking how our lifes are changing frenetically . we have hardly assimilated a new technology when it is replaced or modified by another .

sir , i returned very unhappy from my holidays . the reason is that the musical show that i had seen with my wife , first of all , started late . we bought tickets for the second show , that was at 19 . 30 and it started at 20:15 ! we were interested on see the actors that appeard on the tickets and i was very disappointed when , in the show , we saw another actors . the tickets were more expensive than we had expected , but we didn't care because we saw in the tickets that will be discounts for it , but , they didn't make us discounts ! with all this problems , the only thing that led us , was to eat something . when the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because people didn't arrived to work that day .

to the manager of " the circle theatre " after finishing a stressful year at school , i took a short holiday , whose " splendid ending " was a week in london , while i was there , i saw a very attractive sign: the " over the rainbow " musical show was being played at your theatre , moreover , the wonderful danny brook was the protagonist of it . sadly , i decided to go , along with my girlfriend , but the problems started even before the show , when we wanted to buy the tickets . we asked about " the discounts " that were offered in the advertisement and the only thing that the lady who was selling could say was: what discounts ? then , we moved inside the theatre and we had to wait 45 minutes until the show began ! ! , while we were waiting , we thought we could go to the restaurant after the event , and then , we realized it was closed . by the time the show started , we were so angry that the only thing i remember is that danny brook wasn't acting . i think you have already realized that it wasn't a pleasure for us to see the show , so i hope you could give me our money back , if you can't , please , at least give me an explanation . yours faithfully

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . when you told her something important , she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it . actually , even though she was seventeen , she still behaved like a ten year old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret for example . thus when sally explained her that she had fallen in love with kevin , pat felt very embarassed . in fact , she knew that even if sally was her best friend , she would not be able to keep such a secret . it might seem a bit strange but if pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not , she would have prefered not to know it . pat was totally upset . she felt all the more ill at ease as sally trusted her . thus when sally asked her not to reveal the secret , pat ran away , when home , locked herself in her bedroom . but when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends , she started to cry since she knew that she would use it .

dear sir or madam , after i had read your advertisement i went to " the circle theatre " looking forward to watching your musical " over the rainbow " . in the end i was very disappointed . firstly , the show did not start on time but fourty-five minutes later . this made me a little bit angry because i already had troubles with buying a ticket before : although it was proclaimed in the advertisement , there were no £15 and £10 discounts available . but i did not mind anymore because i knew that a show with danny brook would be worth this . that was why i was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing . this actor was not almost as brilliant as danny brook and i would not have paied so many money if i had known this before . at the end of the musical i decided to " rescue " this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant . like everything had gone wrong that evening , the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill ! i hope you can see that this was no " perfect evening " and i was very disappointed , mostly because this was the last night of our stay in london . i am convinced to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out . yours faithfully gabe grumman ( mrs )

17th of june of 2000 dear sir , i am writing for complaining about different points which i am very disappointing . i was to the theatre to see the musical show called 'over the rainbow' . there i was many problems . first of all , i bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available . secondly , i arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the start time was at 9:30 . however , the show started at 20:15 . i was fed up to wait . the worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show i realized that the actors were totally different . they were worst than the previst actors . after the show , my friends and i were very furious in spite of that . we decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax . the surprise was that the restaurant was closed . i am absolutely annoyed . in my opinion , you have to give back money because everything what you wrote in your advertisement was not true . i hope your answer soon . finally , i want to say you this is the last time which i come to your theatre . thank you . yours sincerely carolina rodrigez .

most people think that character , person and clothes are of a piece . they believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing , amusing , etc . 
i really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon , very exciting . and people will wear cibernetic clothes but in the same time comfortable clothes . i believe that they will wear colourful jeans , t-shirts , mountain boots , etc . and all of this with a lot of colour . from my point of view , they will be more enjoyable than people now because they will have many things to do .

we use cars , trains , ships or planes when we want to go somewhere . but if they weren't made , we would have to walk or go by a horse or donkey . with the help of technology , we do our works in less time . for example ; in the past people used horses to go another place . and their life passed in the ways . but now we use planes to go far places . it takes less time than going by horse .

and computers , the most important product of technology . in the world , people spend the whole day by playing computers . not only as a hobby . they use computers for their works . they connect with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers . sometimes they don't go to their offices . they write their secret notes into the computers . computers hold them in their memory . but in the past people had to use lots of note books and they also had to find places to hide them .

i am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the show you put on two weeks ago at your theatre . 
as i was spending a week-end in london i took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors , danny brook . unfortunately as soon as i came to the theatre i was told that there had been a change in the cast and danny brook was not part of it anymore . besides , since my girlfriend and i had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner , as we had been thinking to have it at your restaurant . you cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20 . 15 instead of 19 . 30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast-food .

in conclusion , i would like to have the two tickets refunded considering also that there were no discounts available , as instead it was stated in the advertisement .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . in fact this was the main cause of mr white's resignation and suicide . pat was not a very clever teen-ager and while she was attending the secondary school she had many troubles with chemistry . i could actually say that if it hadn't been for mr. white she would have never passed her exam to enter university . mr white came to our school when he was 40 year-old but still well-looking and all my girls school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girls felt herself loved by him: pat certainly was one of them . one day while she was walking in central park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree . immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mate and she run away as fast as she could . she was so angry and felt so betrayed by mr white that without any exitation she went to the school headmaster to report everything she had seen . the next day mr white was charged for abuses and obliged to resign . the trial was long and had a wide coverage by media . we live in a small and old fashioned town and mr. white was considered a monster: loosing his job was hard for him , but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so , on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died terrified by the darkness which was nearing .

first of all , the show is far away from being the best musical show in london . i was very exited to see it yesterday , but as soon as i arrived at the theater the problems began . i was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket , as the leaflet says , however it did not happen . after that , i became even more angry because , as far as i concerne , the show must begin on time , but it started forty five minutes late . finally , the actors were not danny brook and tina truelove , but others i have never seeing before , and the restaurant was closed with no advise .

firstly , the great boom of massive comunication wich happened in the beginning of our decade , with the devellopment of telephones , radio stations , television and even satelites , and of course , the internet , gave common people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world , and this provided health and education researches to increase as well .

in the other hand , technology has made the differences between - poor and rich people to grow at a high level , and this is one of the biggest causes of violence in all countries . i addition to that , people will always be affraid of the technological war .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . it didn't take long time until my embarrassing story was out in the open . i asked myself how i could be so stupied , telling her my secret after all i been going through to keep it to myself . but now when the story was out , it was just to start to accept it . maybe it wasn't so bad after all ? all of a sudden i started to believe that this was the best solution of all . now i didn't need to go around and worring about it anymore . at once i felt more assertive and a big smile appeared in my face . i decieded to thank pat , and maybe , if possible , teach her a lession .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . it was may 15 - our english teacher's birthday . marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to organise a surprise for her . 
month ago we began to prepare for this day and we all agreed to keep it in a secret . we have been discussing for a long time what to present her . there were a lot of proposals from the students: one proposed a vase , another - a good pen ( he said it would be useful for the teacher ) . but we decided to buy a picture , because she has always told us about art galleries with a great exitement .

a day before her birthday we had an english lesson , and after the lesson pat came up to marion and told her about our surprise . he was bad-tempered and envious and he didn't want everything to be all right , and besides he didn't like marion . that's why he disappointed marion and us .

modern technology makes our lives different , maybe better . often people do not see how it effects our life style . useful things like tv sets , radios , computers , hi-fi stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day . they help us with daily life and make it more pleasant . transport and communication without cars , trains , planes and telephones will not exist . we know our world from tv screens and computer monitors . without these , and newspapers of course knowing our world could be hard . on the second hand people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers . on the end we must mention modern medicine . it saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases .

for me the most disappointing problem was that the starring danny brook wasn't there . my husband was also looking forward to seeing mr. brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans . the actor which acted instead of danny brook wasn't as good as mr. brook .

first of all , danny brook , an excellent actor , who ( according to the play advertisement ) was supposed to perform , was replaced for a disappointing actor . besides the spectacle was setted up to 19:30 , but ended up starting at 20:15 . in addition to all this , the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered . finally , after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed . sir , i couldn't believe in that , everything that was in the advertisement was a fraud .

some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing could ever happened in their lives . however , since i was a child i have noticed that except for the medical facilities and achievements , it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages . i still remember the day television came to my house , i was only seven , everybody was exciting about the new " toy " , however what seemed to be only one more way to get together , turned to rule our lives . unfortunatly my parents did not realize how tv was creating a role among us . before tv , we used to spend our nights , playing cards , telling jokes , talking to each other . nowadays , i barely know my parents , but i do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas . on the other hand , due to science development , i am getting better , recovering from ahsma . in addition to this it is wonderful not have to wait too long to eat , thanks for the microwaves invention . despite all these advantages , i deeply miss the times i had almost no technological facilities , but a very happy and united family .

i had a very disappointing evening last saturday . i had everything planned ; my family and i were coming to watch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disastrous . firstly there was no discount available , though you promised one in your advertisement , so even my 6-year-old son was charged the adult price . then everything was going well until the show didn't start ! supposedly it was to start at 19:30 . well it didn't . it started 45 minutes late , at exactly 20:15 . and by the way may i ask you how up-to-date your leaflets are because in spite of the advert saying the starring actor was danny brook , it wasn't . it was another actor and one i had never heard of . that was a disappointment for my whole family , in fact . in fact all the audience were very disappointed . 
anyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than i had expected it to be , i didn't enjoy it at all so i was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress . so as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes desparately searching for your restaurants our stomaches rumbling for food . finally we found the place . the location is far too far away and , what do you know , the place is closed for restoration , and it has been for two weeks ! and your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking , with no problems whatsoever . they even gave us a table number .

first of all , the actor was different from your advertisement . i meant he was not danny brook . secondly , it took times to wait about forty five minutes , because it started at 20:15 . it should be on time at 19:30 . then it had no discounts , which the advertisement said so . due to being a student , i think i should have got the discount from your ticket with id card . besides this , the theatre restaurant was early closed . as soon as the show ended , i went to there for having a dessert .

first of all , the prices weren't lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that . then , i expected the show to start on time , but it turned out that i had to wait 45 minutes . moreover , when the play started at last , i couldn't look at the actors . especially i was disappointed by danny brook who made me nervous with his lack of talent .

there is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject , but what can be designed more ? can you imagine the trend which will be as shocking as it has never been ?

the clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality . people spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary , feel comfortable and stand out . they come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time . nowadays it's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significant changes don't turn up . styles mix , colours and shapes come back from the past , only the fabrics are different .

recently , we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives . my life has also changed as a result of modern technology . thanks to computers , phones , mobile phones , internet i can communicate with other people faster than i was able to do before . my father is a sailor and i meet him only four times a year . but thanks to mobile phone i can contact him even if he is sailing in the atlantic ocean . i also enjoy shopping through internet . this way i don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and i can choose fashionable clothes . in the future i would love to be a doctor , especially a cardiologist . nowadays , modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients .

however , i can see some disadvantages of technological progress . first of all , i spend too much time indoors playing computer or watching tv . i know that if i want to keep fit and stay healthy , i must take up some sport . moreover , modern technology has made our environment more polluted . that's why we should abandon cars from city centres , closed down factories which produce too much sewage . although modern progress has made our life easier , it may be also harmful . we should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably .

according to the advertisement , discounts should be available , but , in fact , i was refused to take the payment for tickets in this way . it was very uncamfortable for me . in addition to this , your theatre restaurant was closed because it was too late ( the show did not start on time ) . everybody , who came to it's doors , had to go to the other restaurant in bad mood . i could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous , but it was not even quite interesting .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . she was 25-years-old secretary in one big company . her boss was rich man , really rich . his name was timson white . he was one of the most famous person in his city , but he wasn't honest with his clients . pat had worked for him for two years . certainly she knew a lot of secrets . one of them was about her boss' private life: he had got illegal son .

people were wearing almost everything , during more than 2000 years of their living on earth . everything was changing : style , colour qual . fashion . their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle , climate and money . we saw almost all kinds of skirts , trousers , coats , skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures . what can we suspect then ? what something new hasn't been invented for now ? i say it to you - black and grey . these are two powerful colours , which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years .

first of all , when i bought the tickets i had no discount , and in the advertisement it was mentioned that people would have some , and when i got in the theatre to see the play , i had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun . then , i got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement . there were unknown actors , and they were not as good as the other ones . afterwards , i was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant , but it was already closed because the show ended too late .

we cannot deny that technology has changed our lives . nowadays , we do not need anymore to spend hours cooking , for example: we just put some frozen food in the microwave , and in a few minutes our meal is ready . we can communicate with people in distant countries in real time , using the internet .

there is a lot of other examples of how technology has changed people's lives . i would not do my school projects without using a computer , because i have to do some statistical analysis that i would not do with a calculator . also , i can communicate with some friends who live in other countries by e-mail almost every day , and i save some money because i pay for a local call , and not for an international call . an other thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone , because people can talk to me whenever they need , but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when i am in an important meeting .

i'm writing you to complain about the musical show " over the rainbow " wich was presented last week . your advertising leaflet was completely wrong , it said that danny brook was acting but , when i got there , there was another guy on stage . it was disappointing , specially for me who is a great fan of denny . that's not all ! it started forty-five minutes after the right time and we had to wait outside the theatre . the tickets were supposed to have discounts but the lady who was selling told me that i must be wrong , they never give any discounts to anyone .

after the show , i went to visit your restaurant as suggested on the advertisement but when i got there it was closed . one of the employees of the theatre told me that it was because they were cleaning it to get rid of the rats . i've not impressed when he told me this .

i bought a ticket for the " over the rainbow " musical show last saturday , but i felt very disappointed with it . it was announced that there would be discount tickets available , but there were not . the show should have started at 19 . 30 , but it delayed forty-five minutes . and , the worst of all: danny brook was not on stage . he was replaced by a novice actor who made a very disappointing performance . last , the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a tube and the kitchen was flooded .

internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations . information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data , that would take a much longer time to be found by traditional means . for a shy person , like me , internet has another attractive : the possibility of knowing people and making friends worldwide . it's very exciting . currently , i exchange e-mails with dozens of people all over the country .

i went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as i was a student . however , the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out . i could not understand why but still bought the ticket because i was crazy about danny brook . then , i went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15 , forty-five minutes after the expected starting time . furthermore , i was so disappointed to find out that danny brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that i left the theatre before it finished . at last , i went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning .

a week later , when i was still in a bad mood , my form teacher , mrs brown , talked about jobs in our english lesson . she told us there were numerous types of job in the world . some offered a high salary while some did . however , they are equal important for our society . 'who wants to be a doctor ? ' she asked . many students raised their hands . 'who wants to be a lawyer ? ' again , many students put up their hand . but when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner , nobody raised his hand and i felt so shameful that i lowered my head . 'cleaner is a very good job . ' mrs brown said with a loud voice . 'if there were no cleaner , who would clean the school for us , who would keep the environment nice and tidy . ' suddenly , all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect . the teacher also grinned and i was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'all the jobs have the same importance .

in recent years , mordern technology has been developing increasingly . we get many advantages which improve our daily lives , on the other hand , we also get many disadvantages which could harm us . 
in my opinion , the main advantage is developing of medical technology . for example , if you were hurt seriously like cutting leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body . another advantage is sharing information . the more developing the technology is , the quicker and easier international networking is . so at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country .

in contrast , the technology can cause a pollution . by developing of transport , we can get wherever you want to go easily , however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog . also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which has been combined with mordern technology .

in my opinion modern technology has not really changed my daily life a lot because i am just 20 years old and i used to play with a computer when i was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine . 
i grew up in a world with full of technology and for me the development in the technology is not very big . of course , it changes , it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet . it becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything . you don't have to go to the shop to buy clothes or to the restaurant to order some food . i can just switch on my computer and order everything . i also don't write letters anymore because i write e-mails to my friends . that goes quicker and it is easier for me .

when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very exited about the idea of seeing it , plus when i heard about the facilities that the circle theatre was giving , it becomed the best oportunity i ever had to asist to a musical of that category , but instead of being the best evening i ever had , it was a total disaster and that's the reason why i am writting to you .

like i have already told you , instead of being the perfect evening , it was the worst i ever had . first , the actors that the circle theatre publis in their tickets for over the rainbow were not , which was very disappointing because , the actors were starring the musical , was one of it mayor attractions . another point that i want to comply about , is the time that the musical was supposed to start ( 19:30 ) but it started at 20:15 , so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it , but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the british health institute considered that your food was unhealthy , and not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service , and uncomfortable seats .

there are other machines which are bad for the environment . many industries throw their contaminated air away , without cleaning it before . technology has to move further so it can solve problems as pollution , so we can live better and longer .

dear sir/madam , i am writing to you to complain about the musical show i went to see last wednesday . i was told i would have the most perfect evening in london , but it was not . when i bought my ticket i expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when i had to pay the most expensive price . i went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15 ! i was really angry but i wanted to see danny brook . my surprise was when , instead of mr. brook , a different actor appeared on stage . at the end of the show i decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when i arrived i realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late ! all i am asking for is a full refund of the money i spent in the musical . i look forward to hearing from you . yours faithfully ,

my name is lisa and i'm 21 years old . i went to the theatre last friday to see over the rainbow and i felt disappointed about the musical . i expected more from it . first of all the actor was the same since last semester . i would really like to see a new one such as markin davis , he is a great actor and he would fit well this musical . then i was sitted with my friend just waiting for the start that lasted forever and was supposed to start at 19:30 . after the show i felt really hungry , so i meant to go to the restaurant which occasionally was closed . by the time i thought: " i want my money back . " that was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical i've ever seen .

i'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next saturday where " the old man and the sea " by earnest hemingway will be read . i recommend you listen to it ! as you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us . i suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us ? therefore hemingway is a very good example . he fought in the spanish civil war and in world war ii always on the search for answers to questions like " . . . what defines a man " , or " . . . what happens to us in critical situations " . these experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books . one of the most interesting ones is " the old man and the sea " . a story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught . the story describes his feelings , thoughts , fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish . in the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to " sacrifice " his fish to attacking sharks . so did he finally win or loose ? an interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of hemingway's work and what he meant by " pace under pressure " .

i am writing to complain about the musical which was performed at the circle theatre last week . i saw the performance and it was not as it was described in the advertisement i read in the local newspaper . 
first of all , the main actor was not dany brook as it was expected so . that was very disappointing . secondly it must have started at 14 . 30 and ended by 19 . 30 . however , it started at 20 . 15 . i had to wait almost an hour . then , i was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mention in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true , so i just could buy two tickets and my son could not see the show . finally , i was thinking to have dinner in the threatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees .

computers , radio , cd's , sattelite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life . modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects in my life , and it has some advantages as some disadvantages . 
computers , radio , cds , satellite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life . modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects of my life , and it has some advantages as well as some disadvantages . 
on the one hand , technology is a great help for me at school . what i mean is that computers are very useful to do my homework ( like some monographies or researching ) . and i can't even think about how it would be not having a computer . another advatage is that , for example sattelite television , which is an example of modern technology , makes me be informed about what is happening on the whole world .

in music , before having a computer i could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them into my mind , because , of course , i haven't got an orchestra to play them , but now i just can record one part , and then another part , and then another one . . and i can get the sound of every instrument controlling it with a keyboard , or even create new sounds .

last week i and my family had a holiday in london . at the end of a holiday we decided to go to the theatre . i insisted on going to your theatre , to the circle theatre , because i have heard that it is one of the best theatres in london . that days you presented , , the over the rainbow " . how you have written at the advertisement: it is the london's newest and best musical show . but i and my family had a very disappointing evening . because , at first , at the advertisement was written that in this music show would play danny brook and tina truelove , but it wasn't so . danny brook didn't play at the performance , there was another unknown actor . and he played awful , i couldn't hear him . then at the adverstisement stood that performance begin at 19 . 30 . i and my family came to that time and had to wait till 20:15 , because the show started only at that time . i was very nervious . what is more you wrote that discounts available , but it was also lie . after the show i was very disappointed , because i spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure . he suggested to have a supper in your theatre restaurant . but when we came to it , we saw that the restaurant was closed , because it was reconstructed . but why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement , if it is closed ? so this evening was terriable . it broke all my impression about london . and now i requere my money back . because of nothing what was mentioned at the advertisement i didn't get . 
last week my family and i had a holiday in london . at the end of the holiday we decided to go to the theatre . i insisted on going to your theatre , to the circle theatre , because i have heard that it is one of the best theatres in london . that day you were showing , , the over the rainbow " . as you have written in the advertisement: it is london's newest and best musical show . but my family and i had a very disappointing evening . this was because , firstly , in it said in the advertisement that this music show would star danny brook and tina truelove , but it wasn't so . danny brook didn't act in the performance , there was another , unknown , actor . and he acted awfully , i couldn't hear him . then in the advertisement it said that the performance began at 19 . 30 . my family and i came at that time and had to wait till 20:15 , because the show started only at that time . i was very nervous . what is more , you wrote that discounts were available , but that was also a lie . after the show i was very disappointed , because i spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure . he suggested having supper in your theatre restaurant . but when we got to it , we saw that the restaurant was closed , because it was being reconstructed . but why do you mention about the restaurant in the advertisement , if it is closed ? so this evening was terrible . it spoilt all my impression of london . and now i require request my money back , because nothing that was mentioned in the advertisement i didn't get i didn't get anything that was mentioned in the advertisement . 
there are a lot of new modern technologies around the world , which appear not long ago . among them a mobile telephone , computers , telefaxes , different mashiens for kitchen , mashiens which helps housekeeper to do any work about the house . all of them play a very great role in people's daily life . the first change is that they very simplify the life of people . for example , now women don't spend a lot of time at the kitchen , preparing the meal or washing up dishes . they can only push on their dish mashiens and go to do something what they think more pleasant . so with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time . the computer also plays a very important role in daily life of people . some years ago people especially students had to run to lubraries in order to find a book about something . but now they can use internet , where you can find any information you need . very often i use internet , and i must say it is very convienient . the another modern technology that i use is a mobile telephone .

if i need to say something important to my parents or my friends , of if something terriable has happened with me , i may not run somewhere to find a telephone box . i just use my mobile phone . finally , i can say that modern technologies very help people at their works . with them people do their work more quikly and successfully .

during my last holiday week in london i went to the circle theatre after reading the advertisement of the " over the rainbow " show . i wanted to spend my leisure time well by taking in that cultural event . how stupid of me ! i felt really disappointed . first of all in the advertisement was written , as i had read that before , that danny brook would be starring in the show . unfortunately , the different actor stood in for in it . the time of the beginning of the show was written at half past two p . m . and at half past seven that evening , again . lack of my time made me to go at the evening show . and unfortunately again , from some reasons it was postponed to quarter past eight . another problem - in the advertisement was exactly written some of the discounts of the tickets . no , alas in reality it appeared a mistake . according to the advertisement , after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink . that appeared impossible , because the theatre restaurant was closed . the reason was unknown . that wasn't enough yet . at the end of the advertisement as i noticed it was said something of perfect evening out . it wasn't truth . that's why i write my letter to you and i ask for my money back . i was expecting something really better . mr manager , i warn you , if i don't get my money back , we'll meet at the court .

i believe , living in a modern country , that science and technology affected any aspect of my daily life . looking back in the past , i can see , how big difference is between life of my grandparents and mine . people living in the past couldn't travel so far as we could now and couldn't express the news around the world as we do it now , at present days . they could not communicate with someone living in other country , often located far away from his own . using mobile phones , e-mails or internet , we have a better access to a lot of different news .

so , we are in better situation now . but there are some drawbacks , which appeared last years . for example a lot of pollution has raised . we now breathe worse air in our lungs , then our grand-parents breathed . i think , we are more addicted to do some things , which are not concerned with human nature . for example , people are addicted today to watch tv or often using the mobile phones . i don't really mind them . but i think and strongly believe , that we are the part of wildlife . and the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us , but determinly might destroy us .

firstly , the advertisement told that danny brook was going to starr in a musical but it turned out a completely different person which was very disappointing . it was very unprofessional of you to had printed a wrong starring name on the paper . secondly , according to the advertisment , the musical was supprsed to start at 19 . 30 but it actually started at 20 . 15 which caused me a trouble . as for my ticket , i was expecting to get a discount as a student , as it said so in the advertisement , however , it was not actually available which was very disappointing again . then , i was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant which was recommended in the advertisement , however , it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation which i thought was very unprofessional .

after molly went back home in aberdeen , she told pat that she had met vance and sally in london . then suddenly , pat's face turned to look confused and said in a small voice , ' haven't they broken up long time ago ? sally must have a new boy friend ' . as molly didn't know this , she was so surprised and tried to ask more about it . then , pat realized that it was supposed to be kept as a secret but it just came out of her mouth ! she didn't mean to do so , but this kind of thing happens a lot . now pat is feeling so guilty about what she has done because molly isn't good at keeping secrets either ! everyone is going to know that sally has been cheating both on vance and her new boyfriend and the poor vance is always the last person to know it .

radio , television , stereo , cd , computer: it's hard to believe , but every day i'm using something that borns from the technology . science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of tv in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have further information about something intersts you .

but they can also have a bad influence on people's mind . since i went to school , i've seen my way of thinking has changed : in my mind all must be in order like in a cd-rom of a computer . it's incredible but if i think of the key-word of mind , the only one i can think of is order . then there are television , radio , stereo: another bad aspect is that every day , consciousness , i'm using these instruments . they are objects which take part of my life . in the afternoon i stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems i prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me , in order to meet new people , to speak with them to have a contact with the " human world " . am i crazy ? no , i'm only a daughter of the technology .

last week i went to the circle theatre , of which you are responsable , to se the musical show " over the rainbow " . the advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy . i am writing this letter because i have had a very disappointing evening . everything in the advertisement has been done in the wrong way . firstly there was a different actor in the starring ; you have written danny brook and he was absent . i had joined the show because i like danny brook a lot , but you have changed the program . moreover the advertisement said that the show time was 19 . 30; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late . another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available , but they were not and so i had to pay the whole ticket's price . but the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so i had to go to another place to have dinner .

i think modern technology has changed human's life a lot , expecially starting with the last century . the changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it . in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity to get out : i live on a little mountain at 160 metres of altitud so i cannot go to the city using a bycicle . because of my " isolation " telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and internet so study or do researches , because there are not book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town . moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city because it is too far and she is worried . another thing that i appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; i like very much play guitar , and in my free time i prefer play electric , than acoustic or classic guitar using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible .

firsty the musical show started not at 7 . 30 p . m . but 45 minutes later . i paid for this performance the full price £20 because discounts were not available although on your advertisement there were . and the biggest disappointment for me was that the grateful danny brook , the best singer in london , wasn't present and it was singing a mother unknown person . and last but not least i recognised after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come . . .

i don't know it is a typical situation in the circle theatrer that is promised much more then the people can get for their money , or it was on june 7 ( my visit ) only , but i am not agree with such situation and would ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed . i am looking forward for you answering .

in my opinion modern technology changed our daily life tremendously . 
in my opinion , modern technology has changed our daily life tremendously . 
first of all it changed our life-style . for example ten years ago it was very common that almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and tv . because the people have fast and comfortable cars , they are much more mobil and can spend their free-time more aktiv - they can often visit their friends and travel much more . people today are more open for the world .

secondely we can do our jobs today more efficient . we have modern equipment for communication - phones , faxes , e-mail . we can communicate with our partner faster and better and offer them better service . the ordered goods can be deliver in shorter time by train , trucks and modern ships . if we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more for our daily life - for better clothes , furniture , spare time .

the problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show i've seen . first , danny brook wasn't the star that night , he was replaced by an actor that seemed a rookie . another problem , the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished i couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed ( it closes at 22:00 ) . moreover , there wasn't any discounts availables ( i'm student but i paid a full ticket ) .

" there were some more disappointing situations about which i don't want to write . eventually - you offered a wonderflul evening but i must say that if i had known that it is going to be like that i wouldn't have wasted my time . i feel honoured to write this letter and i feel the oportunity . i would like to recieve back my money . i am looking forward to hearing you from you .

how has modern technology changed your daily life ? the entrance in to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes . many things have been replaced by the others which are more helpful and useful . the most important thing for me is using a computer . the main adventage is that , it provides you all the informations that you need . for example you have to write an essay about 2-nd world war . you get into the internet and you're looking for those facts and informations which will help you to do your homework . searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast . further more you can play with the computer , and unfortunetly this advantage has especially changed my life .

playing the games takes me a lot of time and it became a bad habit . i have no time for learning and for domestic works . on the other hand playing games and using a computer wide my brain so as you can see this modern staft has got many advantages and disadvantages .

the next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone . this little thing brings a lot of satisfaction . it is very useful either . i have got a steady contact with my parents and friends . i have no problems with changing the time of meeting because i can always phone . but actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation . the modern technologies brought to my life a lot of changes . it is even seen in the domestic works . for example i've got at home a very modern and special machine which irons hardly itself . my mother is happy and i am happier because i don't need to put an effort to iron the clothes . i only press the button and everything is going alright .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . i told him my worst love story . one day , i was going to school by bus and i don't know why i went to the end of it . i looked up and i saw her , standing next to me with her friend . every time when i looked up at her my legs were shaking so i couldn't come up and talk to her ! but with help from my friend who convinced me to do this , i've met her . her name was sue and she was so beautiful that i still can't find words which could be good to describe her . i was constantly seeing her but my shyness made my mouth close so i couldn't say anything ! i was in love but that wasn't nice . few days later someone told me that sue was actually a boy ! that was supposed to be a joke from my " coleagues " ! from that moment i feel like i have been in front of a video camera and the operator of it is me ! i couldn't speak to anyone . the worst thing in this story is , that pat told this to everyone at school . from that moment i live alone . thanks to pat .

personally i feel the greatest influence from the side of personal computers . their popularity could be explained by their comfort and easy use . with the help of " internet " it is possible to get much objective and useful information you are interested in . computers take the major part of my free time and this is the reason of disagreements between me and my parents . they would like me to go for a walk more often or to help them in their daily routine . i am completely satisfied with the way i spend my freetime , but they have another opinion .

the boat trip you were asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized . there were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun ! here are some facts for you:
the departures are at 8 am and 10 a . m . every day , but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then ( i know you hate getting up early , but . . . ) . after two hours of the cruise , there is a stop at the beautiful bourne castle where they offer guided tours . i think such a tour is essential , because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle .

i went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable . we were also very lucky with the weather , it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long . i think you should definetly go and i'll try to help in what i can . 
i went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and interesting . we were also very lucky with the weather ; it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long . i think you should definitely go and i'll try to help in any way i can . 
first of all i recommend you to go on the 8 a . m . boat . it might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip . in my opinion a guided tour is essential , because bourne castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .

i think you should take packed lunch with you , because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small ( you'll get very tired walking around the castle ) .

i'm not sure how many students are there in your class but they give reductions for groups over 15 people so maybe you'll have to invite some friends to join you . by the way , i'd love to come with you , if it's possible ! i really enjoyed our trip and i'm eager to see you again !

tv - a powerful force that keeps us glued to itself for endless hours every day , unable to press the " off " button on the remote control . some say it's evil , it spoils our eyes and personality , others say it's useful , enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality . but can each one of these people answer one simple question ! " could you live without television for a week ? "

i can honestly say: i could . i like tv , i watch it but luckily i haven't become a tv addict yet . well , maybe only yet . when do we turn on our tv set ? when we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike . so if i lived without television for a week i'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around , read a good interesting book , go bowling or to a swimming pool . this summer i lived three weeks in a complete tv vacuum , i forgot it had ever existed . i just didn't have time for it , didn't allow it to enter my life . and no , it wasn't a self-made torture . i was just having a good time and i didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings .

you might ask me a normal question " what about news ? " well , i'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forget about newspapers ? and the radio ( if you're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer them to be read to you ! )

the biggest difference the absence of tv had made in my life was that i actually started living . i think everyone can say " no " to tv because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave . and it'll be good for you as well , after a week without tv you'll begin to appritiate it and your life a lot more .

in today's fast moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food . when they are at home , especially children , parents take care of them and always prepare some good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper . 
in today's fast-moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food . when they are at home , especially children , parents take care of them and always prepare a good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper . 
however , students who never have time for healthy diet full of minerals , vitamins or fibre usually finish on " mcdonalds " , hamburgers or bic macs . moreover , very often school canteen doesn't offer diversified food like different kinds of bread or salads . usually we don't eat regularly and in good proportions . our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food . they found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal and even if the times were worse , people were more sensible .

in my opinion people , especially the young , should become more aware of what and when they eat as well as they should work on their lifestyles and keep their head .
