dear sir , 
dear sir , 
i want to thak you for preparing such a good programme for us and especially for taking us to the river trip to greenwich . i would like to know if there is any chance of changing the programme because we have found a very interesting activity to do on tuesday 14 march . it consists on visiting the london fashion and leisure show in the central exhibition hall . i think it's a great opportunity to make greater use of our knowledge of english language . on the other hand , we could learn the different ways to get to the central exhibition hall .

( famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time ) 
famous people such as singers , film stars , etc are always the centre of attention . as some of them are considered idols , their fans want to know how they act in their private lives , with their family or friends . as a response to this demand of information , journalists follow famous people day and night in many different ways , for example , chasing their cars , taking photographs or breaking into their houses while they are on holidays .

the most important thing is that , although they are famous , they are just normal people that deserve to have a private life without journalists and fans following them all the time , and on the other hand people have to learn to respect the famous right to keep their personal lives in secret .

i think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion . we like to keep up with the rage but i think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on .

i have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed . the shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum . if we go to the show , we can do without the free time .

in a country like the uk , we are all bound to have houses . we either own it , or we simply borrow it from other people . we take our homes for granted . think about the people in the poor countries ! they struggle to survive . however , as we approach the future , our homes will start to change .

unfortunatly i have to suggest a change for the programme of tuesday the 14th of march . that's because the " fashion and leisure show " takes place that date in london . all of the students - including my self , think of this as a great opportunity that would be pitty to be missed , especially when students can enter for free .

according to the day's programme , we are visiting the science museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon . my suggestion is to use wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative solution of the shopping . this way we will be able to visit the central exhibition hall on tuesday evening , and see the show .

however , the students in my class , we have seen an advertisement for the london fashion and leisure show which will be on 14th march between 10 . 00 to 19 . 00 at the central exhibition hall , london . the show has many interesting parts such as latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles and we are all agreed that it's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study fashion and design course in next term and the other students are also interesting in new fashion . so we think that it will be useful for all of us .

i believe that everyone in this world have curiosity . we're always want to know about others' life especially the famous one even the one that we hate . but we have to accept that everyone has their private life for example when we get married or when policeman stop us on the highway , we don't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us .

famous people are also the normal people like us just because their jobs are known by every people , it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy . they also want to have special time with their family or their friends . it's not fair for them to have journalists following them and take their photographs and some journalists write the news that not true . we also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people . but it doesn't mean that they have to follow these stars all the time , they should give them some privacy .

first of all , i think they should accept the fact that they are well-known and they should be observed all the time , as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others . moreover , it might be a good thing that scandales usually increase their fame , even if they did anything wrong .

in the next few years the people's home will be changes a lot . first point we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or internet . in the future they both getting closer and closer . that means for exampel while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer . you can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off . your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk , eggs or chees . or never living the office you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath . so in fact people's home became more confienence and comfortabler . i think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household . but the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same . and of course the furnitures of people's home will not change as well .

i knew , i can't swimm then i realized it might be dangerous for me as well . but in this particular moment it wasn't important for me . the most important things was a little boy about ten years old , who was in the watter without parents and couldn't swimm . it was diffucult for me because i am afraid of watter . although i went quickly to him and took him on my hands . he was exhaused and couldn't breath . in the meantime a man told me he were a doctor and could help the boy . i was very happy that i managed to save the live of the boy . now , when i consider about the events it's clear for me that if i got a few minutes later probably would be to late .

those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money , may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay ? would you like to live a life like that , every time you make a wrong step , the whole world is looking at you , judging you . it must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself , you have to show your best side and character .

it was dangerous , but i knew i had to do it . the survive of my family depended on me . we were a poor family , living in one room for five persons . my father died during the war and my mother stayed alone with four children . we haven't enough money to buy food , new clothes and the worse was that my youngerst brother was terribly ill , and without money we couldn't bring him up to a doctor .

i get up very early . all the city was sleeping . the weather was cold . when i arrived in front of the bank , my heart was going faster . a few days before , i had founded a little window at the back of the building , so i entered by this way and by chance i just arrived in the monney 's room . i hadn't never seen so much money . i took it , the most of possible and went out by the same way . i ran to my house and went back in my bed for sleep a little bit .

three years ago , when i was in japan , my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time i got back from school . i always had my own key and unlocked the door by myself . 
it was a horrible day , the day i had left my key at home ! there was nobody to let me in , noway to contact with my parents . what i decided to do was getting into the house by climbing up the roof because i knew one of the windows was unlocked . first , i climbed the tree in the garden . it was okay , beause i was quite good at that , but the problem was that i had to jump onto the roof ! it had been raining , the previous day , so the roof was slippy ! i managed to do that although i cut my knee ! i walked on the roof carefully , not to slip . i was extremely happy when i got into the house . it was a scary , but thrilling and exciting incident !

i guess there will be more gadget to do some housework easier . maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings , washing our dishes , cleaning everywhere , hoovering , etc . will it make life easier ? maybe yes , maybe no . of course these gadgets will do our hard houseworks but otherwise we will get lazy , we will lose our abilities that we have now .

now it ( information technology ) is in our life . we can get everything we want to know from computers . it means we won't need to go somewhere to get some information we need . we'll be stuck to our computers at home . whatever we need we order from to computer and someone will bring . it means we'll lose our social lifes .

mankind has always been seeking different things . we are learning a lot of things about life and we are practising these things . in the future life will be more artificial than it was . 
probably our homes will be smaller than now . because human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay big cities ( like london , new york , paris ) . it means there will be too many people in small areas . then there will have been built smaller houses , flats , buildings , etc . outside big cities there won't be any people at all . that areas will just use for agriculture .

the path we were walking in was quite clean and i was feeling really happy and relaxed . . . until we reached a river . there were nor bridge nor a canoe , the only way to cross it was walking on an old big trunk which was lying down , peacefully , making the only connection between our side and the other .

my mother and brothers had already crossed the river , and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it , but i was paralysed with fear . then , i suddenly realised that i had no choice , so i took all my courage , a big deep breath , and crossed it ! it was easier than i had thought ! . that day , i learnt that i can do even things which , at first sight , seem impossible to be done .

i think it is a great opportunity because i am sure we will enjoy ourselves . but i wonder if the timetable could change , which will be perfect . as you know , all of us want to join the programme , so if some students go to science museum , they will miss the wonderful show . for that reason , i suggest that you could change the activities . in my opinion , we had better go to show instead of science museum and shopping , also we can go to science museum on 15th march , which instead of the free time in the afternoon .

last night , when i went into my house it was quite scilence . i felt there might be something has gone wrong . i found my parents sitting in a armchair . i could see sadness in my father's eyes . my mother came over to me and said softly , ; my dear , your father's company has jut gone bankrupt' , then she couldn't help crying . when i hear this bad news , i was very depressed because father worked quite hard for his company . my father always remembered his responsibily was giving good salary to his worker , which is the view of his life .

in my opinion , each human being has rights to be free . we can go for a wolk , go shopping go to the cinema , marrige or devorce . why famous people couldn't do all this things ? why everybody must know and tolk about their private life ? the most important thing that the famous people are also normal people as us . they live as us , they brief and eat as us , they even following in love as us . i think , they must have a normal , private life without journalists following them all the time and without any exact details about them in the different newspaper's curiouses .

some people are in favour of covering famous people's in-depth stories . because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives . moreover , they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved .

on the other hand , other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment . they claim that it is absolutely intrusion on the privacy . what is more , they insist that before celebrities , they are also human-beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched .

a few days ago , we saw an advertisement about " the london fashion and leisure show " which seems to be very attractive . therefore , after having talked about it , we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there . let me explain you what it is: it must be an exhibition which takes place in the " central exhibition hall " on tuesday and deals with the latest fashions , the different leisures , make up and so on . . .

what do you think about our jobs ? it would be all the more interesting for us as fashion is a great interest for people from our age . moreover , you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students . if you agree , we will only have to change the programme on tuesday afternoon: i mean that instead of shopping , we would go to this exhibition . but i guess that neither us nor you would be against the sacrifice of a " shopping-afternoon " - that we can even put on wednesday during the free-time - so that to enjoy the fashion and leisure show . . .

the respect of famous people's private life has always been a hot topic . . . on the one hand , those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood , thy got married and built a family . . . the only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing which is literally a " public job " . therefore , why do we have to talk and gossip about them ? ! but on the other hand , the aim of a " public job " such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population . and here comes the paradox : do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him ? well , some people would agree whereas others would desagree . i guess this is an unanswerable question . . .

as far as i'm concerned , i would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time , when they chose to be famous . that's as simple as this ! everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so , if they really wanted their privacy , why did they choose a " public job " ? ? even if anyone deserve to have a private life , famous people know and might have made a mistake . . . however , i would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed !

now , we are in the 21th century . most of us live in houses or flats and it is most very comfortable . but in which kind of homes will people stay in the future ? what will be different and what wont change ? we can need our imagination for answering these questions but we will never know the right answer .

i have further ideas : in the futur , maybe in 2113 , there will are houses like now but only with more technical things . the life at home will be more easy because a refrigerator which fill up itself or a bathroom which clean itself . so , people wont have to clean their houses because there are machine for all works .

but i think that people will altough need a bed and a table with a chair . these things and a lot more went change or wont be forgotten . so , i think . houses only will be more moderne and more practique but not very different from our home in the present .

in the future , our homes will have the most advanced technologies . computer will take a important part in our daily life , so that we won't go shopping , because in the computer we would buy whatever we want . books will gradually disappear , and instead we will read all the things we want in our computer . we won't have the necessity of going out from home , because computer will give us everything .

although computers will give us all the material things , it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home , have , etc . that things won't change in our home . we will live in our homes with our family , who will give us love . . . , that kind of things will never change .

almost everyone hates other people gossip in their private things . it's a natural reaccion to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping and bothering your personal thoughts . so i think famous people , no matter if they are politicians or films stars don't deserve being followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time .

i thing that journalit's only aim is money , be cause they know that if they publish famous people's private life they would earn lot's of money selling the magazine or the newspaper . but they don't consider the problems the romours may bring to the famous family or couple . sometimes the journalit's aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil the politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous .

but there's something that i'd like to ask . the london fashion and leisure show will start on tuesday . it's a great opportunity for us because there will be exhibitions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , and of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to apply make-up . 
our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon . by this way , the leisure time would be on tuesday and we would be able to go to the london fashion . thanks for the attention and we're waiting for your answer .

famous people x media
famous people &amp; the media
famous people are special for the rest of the society . they form opinions and invent new fashion styles . nowadays , the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information . the media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people .

it's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life . if the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem . but if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect . everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer .

in summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems . the respect is essential . they deserve to have a private life like any common person .

i was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme . we agreed all that the programme on monday march 13th is wonderful . however , we would like to change the plans on tuesday and wednesday in the morning . on tuesday morning , we will visit the london fashion and leisure show instead of visiting science museum and we will go there tomorrow morning . visiting national art gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on tuesday morning .

the discussion about whether or not the famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is the controversial one . there are people from both side of agrument who have strong feelings . 
the discussion about whether or not famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is a controversial one . there are people from both sides of the argument who have strong feelings . 
there is evidence that these people's life should be advertised by the media . obviously , they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened to them . in addition , their life may be the good example for other people to follow . sometime , many people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate . 
there is a reason why these people's lives should be focused on by the media . obviously , they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happens to them . in addition , their lives may be a good example for other people to follow . sometimes , a lot of people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to imitate imitate the person who they admire . 
however , there is other disadvantages that we should consider . firstly , the famous people would like to do anything they want without being concentrated by media . i think it is annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance would be known by the public . eventhough , the famous people can be the good example , they should be the bad habit for public . a lot of people try to be like people who they admire , for example , buying the clothes that famous people wear . the reason that they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life . to prevent many people from copying too much we shouldn't inform all aspects of life of famous people .

famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing them all the time 
famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time . 
famous people have always been the center of interest for number of people . their wedding , their holiday , their new haircut and so on . but do we think enough about the right to have a private life ? 
famous people have always been the centre of interest for a number of people . their weddings , their holidays , their new haircuts and so on . but do we think enough about the right to have a private life ? 
we can watch this problem from two different points of view . from one side , this people chose to become public people . if we don't want to be in the newspapers , we don't do politics or movies ! but from the other , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers . the case of the princess diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .

general speaking , homes will change considerably . they will become less dark and more confortable than today . people's homes will build more economically by using natural energies like solar or wind energy . this improvments will be involved by the lack of petrol and unrecycling energies .

about the size of hous , i think that in cities houses will be more and more little because of the over population . we also will see very high buildings which contains a lot of narrow flats .

in contrast , in the suburbs or in the countryside , more and more rich people will build big houses . homes like this will be built with the latest technologies and will be very luxurious .

now what's going to be the same . well as i said if you're poor , the government still give you the flat but very ugly one , probably with rats in it . the same problem will be with homeless people who doesn't have money at all , even to buy a food for themselves . they will have to stay on the streets as streets is their home .

many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life . however , in my opinion , famous people , such as politicians and film actors , deserve to have a private life . 
many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life . however , in my opinion , famous people , such as politicians and film actors , deserve to have a private life . 
first of all , everybody has rights to keep their own private life , especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and a family member's or the closest friend's death . it is too cruel for them to be monitored their feelings at that time . 
first of all , everybody has rights to keep their own life private , especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce or a family member's or closest friend's death . it is too cruel for them to have their feeling monitored at that time . 
another reason that i agree famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time , it would result in their death . for example , if diana , who was ex-wife of prince charles , hadn't been followed by paparachi when she was dating with a guy , there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death .

to sum up , nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public . therefore , even famous people need their own life apart from the media .

i was asked by my class to write to you . first of all , we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three days trip to london . indeed , we are especially interested in the sightseeing by bus . the river trip to greenwich is also a marvellous idea ! moreover , we couldn't go there without visiting the science museum and the national art gallery .

however , could we make a suggestion ? having seen an advertisement for the london fashion and leisure show , at the central exhibition hall on tuesday 14th , we would particularly like to go and visit it . how wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city , so famous for it ! besides , as there are more girls than boys in the class , they would certainly enjoy attending on live make-up and hairstyles . lastly , it is free for students , which is fantastic !

on the one hand , i think that some famous people are looking for the media attention . indeed , it can be useful for their career . the more they are in the media , the more they will be famous . according to me , some of them need to be appreciated by fans , they need to be loved and see themselves on television . however , some others only use the media to come back , because they cannot find a job anymore . they need to be famous again . besides , i consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be , in order to have free advertisement . moreover , according to me , it is also a good way for them to earn money . famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it , either in the newspapers or on television .

on the other hand , for other famous people , being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame . in my opinion , it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph . they cannot go to public places , unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs . they would really like a normal life , either because it is their temper , a regarding to their children . nevertheless , they are never let alone , which is a shame . we have to respect them as human beings , what we often forget they are .

from any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today . i think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just pressing a button while we are watching the tv sitting on the sofa .

although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an ufo , in my opinion the changes won't be very important , they will probably consist on making the houseworks easier . the cleanest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our house both are very similar but now we have new technologies . in balance then , i think that the houses that we can see on films won't really exist .

a couple of days ago , my classmates made the suggestion , that they would also like to see the london fashion and leisure show in london , central exhibition hall , which was advertised in a school magazine and there is free entry for students . the show includes the latest fashion wear , sports wear for spare time , make up and hairstyles . at the same time it would be a great opportunity for most of us because we are going to study " art and design " next year .

well , first of all , i think it's quite difficult to be a musician , film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time . in my opinion , most of these people are aware of the consequences like not to have a " private life " anymore . as soon as they are famous , they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place . i can imagine , how annoying it can be sometimes . just think that you'd like to go shopping , clubbing or to a restaurant with friends . there's really no way to be together just only with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these paparazzis .

on the one hand i can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for . it is the way how they earn money , of course .

but on the other hand i have to mention that they are going too far sometimes to take a picture . for example lady diana . do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these nosy paparazzis ? well , this will be an open question to anyone .

i would like to say " thank you " for this london trip plan . we are really excited about it . especially the boat trip on river is a good idea because we all want to see greenwich . we also enjoy the idea of going to the national art gallery and sightseeing by bus . it seems it's going to be a great fun .

i do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in " time out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see . the show's date is very convinient - march 14 - , and it is on central exhibition hall so i do not think it would be a problem to get there .

as you know , we all come from different countries and we are keen on learning some other things about english culture besides the language itself . joining this fashion and leisure show , we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things , such as new hair styles and make up ways , or what is fashion in london recently .

briefly , we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the science museum . we can find another chance to go to the science museum in any other day , but this show is just for this tuesday . also , it's free for students . i hope , it wouldn't cause a trouble to change the programme . i look forward to hearing from you soon .

although human is a social creature , all people need an area to be able to stay away from other people . this is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life . also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others . it can be a lover , a hobby or a habit .

thinking about famous people , we generally tend to ignore this need . i believe this feeling sources from a strange though ; when somebody gets famous , whatever the job is they do , we think we have some kind of right over them . consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives . press takes this demand as an order , and " but public wants to know " becomes a nightmare for famous people .

in fact , what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people . because they have to spend too much time in front of other people , they are even more sensitive about their privacy . i am quiet sure , even the ones , who have chosen their occupies just to be famous , don't like to be pictured when they believe they are alone . the situation much be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this .

obviously , there is no point in saying " famous people have a right to their own live . " although this statement is absuletely true , it seems there is no way to stop public attention , so they will keep living with journalists .

on the other hand , we could say that they decided to have such kind of life . maybe they need to pay the price for being rich and popular ? maybe sometimes they need to sacrifice their privacy ?

since always , medias has been keen of famous people life and it's becoming worst and worst , you can find everything in " gossip " newspapers . does famous people deserve to keep their own life secret ? 
since always , medias has been keen of famous people life and it's becoming worse and worse , you can find everything in " gossip " newspapers . do famous people deserve to keep their private life secret ? 
according to me , you can't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when to start you career you know that medias will be hunting you everywhere and more famous you get worst it is going to be because that the life style people wants to know everything , for instance , about their favourite actor or about their president . . they saw them many time on t . v . or cinema , so people wonder about them . and famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever it's because you like to show yourself .

therefore , even if i agree sometimes medias are going too far and write really bad things . if you're famous you cannot have private life because all of this is a part of their job .

i'm suggesting how programme could be changed . the fashion starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p . m . and will be realized on 14 march , so we can change the shopping with this event that is realized in the afternoon , and put the shopping at night . there will be a great success !

in my view prince charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media . when he goes skiing in switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures . after this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday .

it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not , they just try to find the best pose . after taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them , they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission . this is the most argueing point . do they have to ask for their permission or not .

on the other hand , famous people have point , if they do not allow paparazzis to take their pictures . because , althoug they are famous they have also their private life . unless they do not want to share it , it must be acceptable for us . i think the best example would be lady diana . it was said that while they were trying escape from paparazzis they had that accident , which caused of their lives . this can not be the way in finding information for the readers .

few years ago , we had a terrible news of death of lady diana . she was always been aftering by media . she had no private life even though she wanted to be alone . finally , after chasing for long time , she was dead because of car accident . it must be a good example of media disaster . i understand she had a good reason to be chased by it . however she definetely deserve to have a private life as one of citizen . human right must be existed for all people .

nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy . i personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authopraps . like in the zoo . the biggest commercial gain in history i believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .

it is certain that these people have fame , fortune and success , and that many of them are rich , very rich . they usually appear on tv , go to shows , sports competitions . . . but i'm sure that all these things can not give them back one of the most needed things: a private life . and believe me , there is no money in the world to pay that .

i have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the london fashion and leisure show in . we could do as planned for monday and move going to the science museum from tuesday to wednesday afternoon . we would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping . we can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .

everyday , something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a plier , even homes are effected . from letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves , but we aren't just going to stop here are we ? no , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old , outdated and changed .

i see a very different home for us in the future . most things will be computerised . we might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys . we an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers . we might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room . cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door .

although all that may change our houses may be still the same . the rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style . we might still favour that old carpet and couch . the furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too .

in the future , every child might have a laptop . and instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ? we will be learning at home using computers and disc . never have to leave the house or wake up so early . another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using . we might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something other with the same purpose .

famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time . we know it does not matter they are famous or not , everyone has his own privacy . however , as human beings , almost all of us are curious . we like to know and chat about gossip . this is why gossip magazines are so popular . due to commercial value , journalists have to follow them all the time to peep their private lives to satisfy us . there , it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them .

however , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but morality and priciples are also being concerned . of course , it everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better . i remember in august 1997 princess diana died in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples .

although we can not deny it is our nature - curious , we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them . actually , i am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of princess diana and try to let her children and royal family have more privacy . lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives .

i understood that you're looking for your cousin's birthday present , and you'd like give to him a book , which , i think , it's a good idea . the last book i read was wuthering heights by emilie brontë . it's a fantastique book , which i recommend to everybody keen on lovestories . it's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties . i recone that it's quite not an easy reading , but as you described your cousin , i think she really will enjoy it , she's such good in litteracy , that it won't be a problem for her . i really think you should choose this one for her , it does go with her personnality . it'll be a good point for her general culture , wuthering heights it's a classic , which everybody knows about it , even if they didn't have read it , they , at liest , know the story .

some people said that famous people such as politicians , and film stars , needs to have a private life without journalists following them all the time . i strongly agree with this . firstly , most people might remember the sad story of " princess diana " she died in paris few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called " paparach " . if she was not followed by journalists , she wouldn't die . so , this fact shows obviously that famous people without private life could be the victim .

but on the other hand , ordinary people , including me , are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion . moreover , people are interested in their life style . i think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after " princess diana's " accident .

however , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so that they might do something , for example , ashame things in public space or argument with partner or family even put on swimming costume like us . so they can be just ordinaly people like us . we have to think about this way .

overall , people should think if we were famous people . . . and then we can find the answer that all people , including famous people , need private life and would like to behave in ordinaly life .

i would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the science museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping , so i believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students ! the most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 i think that everyone will have finished their shopping .

some people think that to be a famous person is very excuiting thing , that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well . 
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing , that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well . 
i believe , that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results . for example , the politicians the have choosed their careers , they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy . 
i believe that if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results . for example , politicians have chosen their careers ; they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful about their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation , and they will not be considered trustworthy . 
another succesfull carreer such as , film stars must also be balanced . if somebody is a film star this mean that has got a different kind of life , more comfortable , more interesting but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .

if somebody wants to be famous of cource must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her . but i think that the are limits . everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer . it doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow . you must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself . and finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people .

dear principal , first of all , we would like to thank you for good programme which provides us 3 days stay in london . it contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum and gallery , shopping . it is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment . however , we have found an advertisement for the london fashion and leisure show , which will be held at central exhibition hall on 14th of march . the advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles etc . moreover , students are allowed to admit for free .

all of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up , so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like . it would be grateful if you give a little change in programme so that we are able to attend the show . it seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the london fashion and leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping . i am looking forward to hearing from you .

technical and warm home people's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology . to begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house . 50 years ago , korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food . since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their life have been far easier than before . today , however , people do not need to spend many times on making food , washing up , or even on turning on an off the light . machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary . from my point of view , people's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , tv , cooker and the light , connecting to the owner . he/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs , even though the owner is far from the house . on the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family " . in spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves . computer might know better than human , but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .

it was dangerous , but i knew i had to do it . i was having holidays with my parents and some friends in india and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food . one day we were invited from locals to visit a little town five hours away from new dehli . although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity visiting a place with no tourists , i was a little bit scared .

being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes . but not always famous people are happy of their condition . usually if you ask them what they would desire most , the answer is: " i would like to be able to live like ordinary people do " 
being famous and rich rich and famous is something all of us have dreamt of at some time . but famous people aren't always happy with their situation . usually if you ask them what they desire most , the answer is: " i would like to be able to live like ordinary people do . " 
there is no surprise to this answer : famous people can not have their own private life . whenever they go out they are suddenly " hounded " by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo . they can not even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph . but the worst thing of all is that they are often victim of malicious gossips , which most of the times are not even true .

in conclusion , i believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings , on the other hand , however , i think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have . also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed : not always , in fact , money and celebrity being happiness .

the ways of living are always changing . it is no doubt that functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation , for example , have been . thinking about the home of the future , first of all , nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies , which make house-keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for convenient life . people may tend to avoid from living in a large number of families in an expected small house in a city .

on the other hand , the bond between parents and children should be unlikly to change . people always need their parents , children and so on . the longer and further they live on their own , the more they may feel that they need a family .

in the second day , we had to climb up a twenty metres hill with our hands . it was so difficult for me because i was really scared to stand in a high place since i was young . i did not want to climb up but i did not have any choice . so i started to climb really slow and careful , and i climbed about 15 metres quite success , so i tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away . but after i climbed two steps more , my right feet slipped over , i was nearly fell down , but luckly my hand caught a rock , it was dangerous , but i didn't had any choice , finally i did it .

in my opinion i think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life . firstly , because it is a lot of " scandale magazine readers " . secondly , because they have admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a " star life " look like .

we walked all day and rested in the evenings . we were not allowed to leave our tents during the night or until the day starts started , because of the dangerous animals which live there . but for me it was the most exciting moment . one can be really amazed by the view . 
one day at five o'clock in the morning i stepped out of my tent without seen and started walking towards the river , because i want take some photographs of the sun rise . the view took my breath of when suddenly something took my breath . it was a panther . i was petrified because it looked as she was very hungry . i knew i could not do any moviment for my safety but i did and for my surprise it run away .

dear mr. robertson thank you for your good programme for english class , especially it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see . all of us in english class look forward to visiting these places . however , we'd like to ask about london fashion and leisure show that we've seen an advertisement on this week college newspaper . we would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in london . it should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles , as you know , this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course . we've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as dress and hairstyle for an interview . and mostly , it should a great opportunity for the art students who are attending english class . most of students in our class are studying fashion as full-time . especially , it does not cost at all for students . but the only problem for the show is the date which is on tuesday 14 march from 10 . 00 to 19 . 00 . as we're considering your programme we're supposed to go science museum and shopping . we're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day . but mr. robertson , these our suggestions are depended on your programme , we're just suggesting . again we're so sorry that we give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us . we are look forward to hearing from you yours sincerely ,

living in a high building ! but we could have everything we want . home might be a mixture with modern styles and a natural appearance as well .

these days a lot of countries have been worried about lands that can't have enough space to build houses . the prices for land are increasing because of this . 
so i think that the future home could be considered this points . i mean most of home are going to be in a building like a flat . maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building . i believe there are a lot of high buildings now in japan . most of them are flats which have at lest 20 floors . it means japanese are planning for the future home .

but what my imagination is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices , leisure centre , shopping centre even school . because we are living in computerlised life , so we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well .

by the way , our classmates have seen an advertisement for the london fashion and leisure show . it will show us the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear . in addition , make up and hairstyles shows will take place at the same time . we think it would be a wonderful chance to have a new experience . what is better , all students can participate without paying . it takes place at central exhibition hall in london . and it starts from 10 to 19 on 14th of march . so we would like to suggest you to put this programme into the morning time on tuesday instead of science museum and put science museum into free time on wednesday .

much safer but still at home

our homes have change with many comfortable things compare with the past . as many inventors made lots of things , we can live in good facilites houses: but do you think no more comfortable homes will be built ? 
our homes have changed with many comfortable things compared with the past . as many inventors made lots of things , we can live in good facilities well-equipped houses: but do you think no more comfortable homes will be built ? 
our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives . for example , now we have a security safety like a bell or button . but in the future , we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside . that is , our security system will be much stronger . on the other hand , what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home , such as a beautiful garden , a small terrace . because it is a instinct that people prefer comfortable place and want to take a rest in a peaceful place .

first of all , you might not know what this show is . in fact , it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles . it would be interesting for us to see all that " live " , rather than on tv . furthermore , it is a great opportunity for us because the entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget . the show takes place on 14th march from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock . we all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move to the show . it would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while .

we had decided to climb that more than 3'700 -metre-high mountain near arolla in switzerland two weeks beforehand . we had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain , on that 4th of september 1995 . it all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours . however , it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking . my friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock . we could immediatly see that it was broken . he couldn't move any more and my mobilephone was not able to find a proper network . we were trapped !

i finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet . it was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time . however , we would have frozen to death if we had stood where we were . after ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet , from which we were able to call a helicopter . we were safe !

it was dangerous , but i know i had to do it . even though all of my friends who were with me in that day all said " just let it go , it's just only a puppy . why do you have to take a risk ?

if you imagine how dangerous you were while you had to stop your car and got off the car on the highway where there were only car at least 120 km/hr running along your side . it was true that small dog were in danger , but your life was in that situation as well once you decide to do that brave thing . all my body was shaking , and i would almost have turned back to my car if i didn't here that small creature cry as if he wanted me to be his owner .

i believe all the people famous or not , deserve to have private life without journalists to following them all the time . they are humans like all of us with their problems , their good and bad times and of course they don't want to be publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is right . and good for his pocket .

i think the only way of change that is , the people , if the people shows no interest the journalist would have no goal of publish any gossips because is not going to be watch or read by anyone . so the power is to the people .

and , there should be a electrical servant in everyone's home . so there's no need for people to do the household work . there should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not sleepy . if you're tire , the pill can give you vitamin , protein and make you refresh

for electrical goods , there will be no any kind of electrical products except computer . people will do anything on the computer , including watching tv , listen to music , chat with people . as the computer is being as a multi-functional products .

on the other hand , there're some ways that remain the same . the toilet should remain the same as people need to use daily and nothing can replace it . second , there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful and fun . since friends and family members won't change and replace , by anything .

to begin with , we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians , although they sometimes aren't truly . in addition we are fascinated in their marriage , children , holidays etc . what is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known . by chosing this style of life they should realise , how their life would look like .

i think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people , your fans for example all 24 hours in a day , and the all things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who is your friend , where you go shopping , who you love in and who you sleep with . on my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen .

it was a fantastic sunny day of august and my friends and i took a day off from work . there were just four of us . we all decided to go to have a day by the seaside not far away from portsmouth . when we got there we were wearing our costumes . we lied on the sand under the sun , we had funny beach volley matches , interesting chats , but after two hours there , my friends decided to go swimming . for me , it was a big problem because i had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that . i didn't want to tell them because i was sure they would have started laughing of me . so i took the decision to go and join them also if i knew that it would have been dangerous for my life . i walked very slowly through the water and i was very scared but i had to do it because if i didn't go my friends could understand that something was wrong with me . in the end fortunately everything went well as i didn't sink in the sea . after that day , i decided taking up swimming , so that i would have had no embarrass in the future trips to the seaside any more .

the future is unexpectable and human beings are afriad of dangers , such as tornado or earthquake . thinking about home like a place to live , is not already worth . we must think about home from other point of view . we need to make our home a place where we want to come back after the work or school . it has to be pleasure to be there for us . what we really need in the next millenium is love , that is what will keep all family together and forever . do we care about a new carpet or a fashionable furniture ? no ; i do not think so . live is too short to think about the poscesives .

everyone likes sale , but those so-called sale items are not really of value . in fashion industry , sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time , because those owners want to make room for new stock . but you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones . also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit . therefore , we become impulsive buyers easily under these tricks . the result , we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated , or even suffer from financial difficulty .

shopping does not just effect us mentally , but also physically . it's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping . think of the awful crowds , the busy car parks , polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks . i don't think anyone would really like to face them . but once you get there , they're just inevitable , aren't they ?

shopping is not always enjoyable . 
shopping is an ordinary way of life . we always need fresh food such as vegetables , fruits , milk and etc . at least most people will do their shopping twice a week for a fresh food . you might think shopping is enjoyable but i don't think it always enjoyable . you have to try to park your cark first which sometime the space are fulled and after you have parked your car and went in the supermarket the product you wanted have run out so you have to changes your plan for dinner or going to another supermarket to facing a long queue . that make you whole day for shopping which was not fun at all .

if an activity has stay with us , the mankind , for so long , it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price mark on it , that is the greatest extasis .

going for shopping is a good thing when you don't know what to do but it has also many disavantages . 
going shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it also has many disadvantages . 
first of all , shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day ! especially if you go shopping on a saturday , when people are on week-end . streets are crowded and you can't walk easily . you are embarrassed with the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want .

shopping is not always enjoyable because of several factors . 
one could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like , and you decide to buy it , but when you see the price , you find out that it's too expencive , and you cannot afford to buy it . the only thing you mostly say is , " if i had more money , i would buy it " , or " i wish i had more money .

" 
another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things , and cannot help you , so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own . i think this is a common problem in shops , and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything , and i thing the solution would be to hire more workers .

i would prefer living in a tent during the two weeks because i think a tent is more natural . a log cabin doesn't sound like a camp holiday . it sounds like a summer-holiday at the beach of italy .

from the activities i want to take golf and surfing . both activities i've never done in my life , so i am a complete beginner in playing golf and in surfing . but the reason i want to try these two activities are their image . golf play the wealthy people , the upper class of a town , and surfing sounds like freedom .

in my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable . very often , for example on friday afternoon or saturday , there are so many people in a shopping centre , that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards . many people say that this is real shopping , when you queue for hours to pay only a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket . i think , you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something .

i like going shopping during the week , when i can look at each good a store sells . but for me it is better , when i go at the weekend because then i don't spend so much money because i think , before i have to queue for half an hour i buy nothing !

shopping is when human goes to the shop and buy what they went , however i think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes all sort of things . 
shopping is when humans people go to the shops and buy what they want . however , i think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes and all sorts of things . 
anyway shopping is not always enjoyable as the title because firstly you will get tied because you have to walk out and in the shops . secondly you will get angry on bad treatment of the sellers in the shop . thirdly if you're fat you won't find you size . forthly that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy to much things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by your self . 
anyway , shopping is not always enjoyable as the title states because firstly you will get tired because you have to walk in and out the shops . secondly you will get angry at the bad manners of the assistants in the shop . thirdly , if you're fat you won't find your size . fourthly , that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself . 
i think if you have lots of money and don't know what to do with it , do not go shopping give the money to charity , that is better than shopping . for me my opinions on this one is true it is boring , it might because i am a boy .

thanks very much for your last letter . because i could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the radiohead concert last month , i'll tell you something: it was fantastic . 
i friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before , so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else , because they'd run out of stuff . he asked to me to go and when he told me the group was radiohead i felt the luckiest person in the world ( you know i've always been an enthusiastic fan of them , so you can imagine how excited i was ) . i couldn't wait for it .

but the most amazing thing happened later , when ten minutes before the concert began , my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage . for a while i thought it was a dream . the playing was excellent , the public enjoyed it very much but , above all , i was there , at ten metres from my favourite group . i even got a few friendly words from the singer in a piece of paper: i hope you've enjoyed it . and his signature . i'll always keep it like a treasure .

besides i would prefer staying in a tent . it provides me a feeling of adventure which is very exciting . i'm also very glad to see such a variety of activities at the camp . it's quite difficult to say wether i prefer painting or sailing . all in all i have never practised golf nor surfing , so let's try it !

but shopping is not always enjoyable . especially if you are going with women or children to the shops . that is my worst nightmare . i never go shopping with women and especially with my mother or my sisters . and that's because they spend hours trying on any kind of clothes , everything you can imagine , and at the end they are not buying anything . they also like going to loads of shops , in different parts of the city . at the end i feel very tired and angry , because i spent the whole morning doing nothing , except from looking at them trying diferent clothes , and that's not enjoyable at all , in fact it's realy annoying .

on the other hand everything looks different if i have to make a present for someone in my family . i start thinking what she or he prefer and i try my best buying something apropiate doesn't matter how much money does it cost .

in conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested to please .

we would like to believe that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life . after working all week , finally on saturday we can go shopping . we love spending money , but spending money is not always enjoyable . 
problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car . when we finally do this , we cannot go confortable because of crowd . why its always the same ! the answer is that we choose the same street ( usually the most popular ) and the same time as six hundrets other people . we become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure . i think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods .

sincerely , i must admit , that i don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores . there are always too many people there . as i'm not keen of being a part of the crowd , i prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops . furthermore , it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores .

another thing i dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants which try to sale any products to the " victim " entring the door . otherwise shopping is not so bad , as you get what you want in the end .

in our lyceum we have listem of " double lessons " . it means that every day exept sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for hour and a half and it means " double lesson " . i think that is more convinient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty five minutes . it is convinient , i mean " double " lessons because you have more time to understand matherial what is givven and because you have to prepare only four subjects for " tomorrow " and it is less then seven subjects .

it often begins with finding a parking space for the car , which can take more than 15 minutes . leaving the car at home is also not a good idea as you often buy so much that you can't carry it in plastic bags . 
the next stressful factor begins in the shop : everywhere people who are in a hurry and push you from one side to the other . consuming has become a very important thing for them . and if you are not quick enough they won't leave anything left . but there occure also problems if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive .

as i'm an artist student in a particular college , i only can go to your camp california in july , because in this month i got no class , and i'm free to do whatever i want to . i'd like log cabins as my accomodation , because it's safer and cleaner than tents and i wouldn't share it to anyone .

painting and photography are the activities good for me . they fit to myself because my art work develops itself in these areas . in painting i talk about human beings in this world , in big canvases; and in photography , with collages , i talk about anger and guilty in the families' lines . so in camp california i would like to keep me on touching to these areas .

shopping is something made , which do not need to be enjoyable . we can analyze when shopping is enjoyable , and when it is not . 
there is joy in shopping when it is made by ourselves to ourselves . it means buying whatever we like , just like clothes , records , rings , and books . what we like is based in our relationship to another people , in the work or in the family . so we have enjoyable when we buy what we like following another people's views .

on the other hand , sickness in ourselves our relatives made us unhappy to buy . it is an obligation shopping medicines , clothes to winter , doctor visites , and so forth . a death in the family is not also an enjoyable shopping experience , because it is the highest point of the sickness . buying coffins and graveyards to bury relatieves is not as enjoyable as buying clothes .

for me went to shop it's not the best thing i can do . well i think the opposite like a year before but recently i think this because i see all the people to go shopping they don't realised that they are outside in the real world poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things , you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now , but tomorrow you don't know . i like to shop sometimes but not always and not spending a lot of money on things that i don't really need . at the rest of you who don't understand this it's on your memories to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need .

most of the students agree in saying that two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together without the help of the teacher to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher .

i think i told you about my plans of entering a group that helps at concerts , didn't i ? well , i took my chance and i was chosen to help at michael jackson's concert . amazing , isn't it ? the event took place a month ago in the rock stadium . there was about 100 000 people . we had a lot of things to do . acctually , they put me very close to the stage , in the middle of the real hell . many people fainted and some of them , the most serious cases , had to be taken to hospital . the biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak polish or english and we didn't know how to help them . despite this fact , the atmosphere was terrific .

after the concert many people lost their way home , mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule . we had to order taxis for them as they didn't have mobile telephones . however , they were very nice people .

as you asked me in your last letter , i am going to tell you more about last month's pop concert . 
firstly , i arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene . as soon as all the conections was made , we tested the nivel of the sound : i found it too loud , so i advised them to regular it , and they listed to me ! then , there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights : it was just enought time .

thus , it was a fantastic afternoon because i like very much music , even if i don't play any music instrument . moreover , i learnt a lot about music , especially concerning the way of using an instrument . consequently , i hope i will play an instrument in the future , especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument .

but other people don't think like this , for example , there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion the girl get lost . the mother was shock , she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going out and in the places , it was nightmare but fortunaly the police found her .

first of all , i think we should have a protagonist for it . a good idea to start will be a clock alarm ringing close to his bed , because that's the way everyone get up in the morning , ( unless the people who don't do anythink ) 
first of all , i think we should have a protagonist for it . a good idea to start will be an alarm clock ringing close to his bed , because that's the way everyone gets up in the morning ( apart from the people who don't do anything ) . 
after that , we should have a morning view of one of the most busiest london tube station in order to show stressed people going in and out , including our protagonist going out peacefully with a couple of books on his hand - then the school's door , and him going in .

anyway , to participate in two-weeks camp california in the u . s . a i readily give you my personal details and information . first of all , the most favorable time for me to travel is july , because i am in the final year of university , so i have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from july , when i can take a relatively long summer holiday . second of all , i would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents , since i have had a horrible experience being attaked by a herd of midges , when i camped out . additionally , i am very happy to be given the chance to do some activities during the stay . i would willingly like to choose swimming and painting . i used to belong to a swimming club and practise swimming a couple of times a week . i have also gone in for some competitions . painting is one of my hobbies as well , although i do not specialise in it or anything . i'm looking forward to painting beautiful landscapes of california . last but not at least , what sort of clothes do you think i must bring with me , and is there any laundry system there ? also should i take some money just in case ?

according to statistics based on the questionnair , the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an english class . this may be thanks to native speaker teachers who came to the school last year . in fact , i visited some englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers . furthermore less numbers of students were nodding off comparing with other classes like maths . consequently it might be a good idea to film the english class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed . this may also contribute to the promotion of english department .

to sum up , our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements . the whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books but also enjoying our school life . it might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of .

when you go to a sale shop it is dificult to find what you look for without a help of the shop assistant . the problem is find a shop assistant who hear your problems and can help you . after that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times isn't possible pay with your credit card and you don't have a money in cash . so you had lost hours to buy nothing . you can't talk to manager even to give him suggestions to improve his business , because he is always absent . and don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you .

in general , shopping is considered a pleasant activity . actualy most people work hard to earn their money and consequently , the occasion in which this money is spent to buy something useful , or simply something they like , should be considered a very pleasant situation . in fact , the shopping you do for the daily needs is seldom enjouble , as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations . shops and markets are often noisy and crowded , you don't know where to park your car , shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job . anyway if you can choose the time and the place , and if you go shopping just because you like it , and not because you need it , shopping can be a very nice activity .

hi ! how are you ? how are you getting on with your school work ? do you enjoy your school life ? as you know , i had a wonderful experience last month so i am writing to tell you about it . 
i was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month . at that time , i was so nervous because i did not know what to do . however , i was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star , kelly chen . when i first entred the concert hall , i was given a pass for working here . there were five other students , like me , who were waiting to help . we were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other . i found that they were all kelly's fans . we were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall . there were lots of decorations and i had to put the decorations to the right place . it was a tiring work because i had to run from place to place for hanging the decorations . after i had finished my work , i saw kelly chen walking into the concert hall . she smiled at me and said thank you to me . i was very happy at that time and i thought it was the happiest moment that i ever had . at last , the concert was started . there were many people at the show and i was sitting on a good seat to watch the concert .

shopping can be painful
shopping can be painful
as a child , i would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother , whose desire to buy , without any sort of control , all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable . and due to these bizarre situations i went through as a little boy , everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which i'm forced to drink .

it is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd , having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers , trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping . certainly , buying things can be a pleasant activity , especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself . but situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and , when they do happen , time passes by very fast . however , if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd , waiting for the queue to move , time slowly melts .

believe me , shopping can also be painful . your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects . amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains .

nonetheless , people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake . they keep claiming that there's no such thing as shopping . in spite of our decadence , some cheap souls still have the courage to say that , by shopping , they're filling their empty spaces .

i would like to go in july for it's the only month i can choose . in july i'll be on my vacation . as for accomodation i prefer to live in tents . in my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it . i'd be glad to choose painting and singing . and i'm good at both because i used to attend to a painting studio when i was at school . i also used to join the school choir and was one of the best sopranos . so i'd be happy to do the activities on two reasons . first i am good enough at both of them . secondly i truly love painting and singing .

log cabines will be ideal accomodation , presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy . it's always nice to have a warm , clean place to go to after sailing which is one of the activities i would like to do . and i'm quite good at . climbing would be my second option , for this i'm afraid i would need some instruction for i've only done it a few times .

of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakes . the hard work , though , started when everyone left at the end of the concert . it was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not , all the popstars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-overs !

i can't understand these people because this situation never happen to me . by the way usually the people that don't like shopping are men or children . i think is difficult to find a woman that doesn't like shopping . but i have to admit that sometimes i don't really like shopping above all when i'm tired or when i'm not in the right mood . in fact if i'm not in the right mood i become nervous because i can't find anything .

due to my business , i am very busy and that it is the best moment for my business so , i can't manage my time to go on holiday but i'd be able to travel at anytime in july . i would prefer to stay in a tent as i feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin . as you offered me two activities , i would like to go on swimming . i am not a good swimmer yet but soon i will be . i have been learning swimming for the last eight months and i really enjoyed it . another sport i experience is basketball which i used to play for a school's team when i studied at secondary school . i have not been practising it at all recently but only wish i had . this trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again .

there was a concert of michael jackson in my city last month . it was a charity concert which was organised by a university i am studying . my classmates and i , we were asked to do decorating the stage , cleaning the concert's area . but guess kim , what was the most exciting for us was , we were asked to be the singer's interviewer . it wasn't a spokeperson kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage . i was so nervous that i couldn't remember what to say . if you imagined yourself talking to the most famous pop singer such as him how would you feel ? but what i really enjoyed on that evening was when we took a photographs with him after his concert and he signed it for us on the back side of each picture .

when you spend money on goods and services , it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable . there are a few reasons . 
firstly , you cannot always get the right one although you scour about all the shops to find something you want . you may only get tired on your feet . and also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers , especially , on the special occasion like on sale . secondly , you cannot exclude that you might get a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home .

in addition to this , even if you buy something you would like , you can change your mind at home . sometimes , a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping , you might get something beautiful or good to you . so you would spend more money you have expected .

to sum up , you should spend money as your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable .

shopping is my everyday life . i'm a mother of four children and you can easily imagine how many things i have to buy in a week . it starts with food ( monstruous ) and goes on with clothes , pills , games and so on . it never ends ! but unlikely to what you could think , i love shopping . i find it a very relaxing moment . at home , you have to work hard and you're often stressful because of your children always asking you for something . when you're shopping , you can finally relax , just admiring what you're seeing . your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream !

the statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to my opinion . if you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop , which sells what you are looking for . once you've found you should take everything you like and go into the cabin . 
the statement mentioned is perfectly in tune with my opinion . if you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop which sells what you are looking for . once you've found it you should take everything you like and go into the fitting room . 
it's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend , because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took doesn't fit . often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity .

after trying on about twenty different tops , dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly . at the end you may have found only two or three things you really like , but they are all the work worth .

the shopping is great when you have lots of moneys , times ; you can buy clothes , shoes , make-up; cd , whatever . but , it's not easy for workers , because the shops close their doors about 5 . 30 pm ( half past five ) . when you work in a office , a manufactory , a society , you have the same planning to them . so you just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break . if not , you can go the saturdays but badly , there are too costumers . you can't walk , try clothes , it's very hot . the salewomen are too busy and haven't a moment for give you a counsil service .

sometimes the saleswomen aren't friendly , because they are stressed or they aren't the sale feeling . 
finally i think , it will be better if the shops stay open until 7 . 30 pm ( half past seven ) . it will be a good service for their costumer and more cool for them .

first of all , if you want to buy nice dresses , the first thing you have to do is looking around all shops and department stores in a city . if you are lucky enough , you might find them within 30 minutes , but if you don't , you might have to keep walking for several hours and still couldn't find ones ! ! that's would be so exhausting .

next thing you have to do is trying them on . you have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms . after that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitted clothes taking off and putting on . that's a hell ! !

there was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping . that was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time . another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment . the musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound . we had to be very careful . have you any idea how much does this stuff worth ? you don't even want to know .

even if i could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that i've gained through it ! i've learned the meaning of the words " reliability " and " responsibility " . anyway the result of the whole preparation is far more enjoyable and relaxing .

i would like to give you and the others in the class my opinion ( concerning the video that you are going to make ) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why . 
well , in my point of view the most interesting lessons that we do at school but in real life are useful , are maths because everything we do is all about maths . the other lesson that i think is very important is physics because of the same reason as maths . on the other hand i think that geography is important as well because we must all know where we live , what are the problems that we have in this world , what problem does every different country have and where does the petroleum come from and what are the advantages and disadvantages for it and the gold as well , there are loads of thinks about geography that we must know .

shopping is not always enjoyable . 
there are two kinds of shopping; the first one is shopping for fun . you often see young ladies looking for the nicest dress , the most beautiful shoes and so on . . . they are all excited when thinking about the party they have been invited to . this is very nice when you can do your shopping like that .

the second kind of shopping is not enjoyable . it is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread , butter , milk etc . . . it is always the same . you have to find the best article for the best price . you are among thousands of people , but at the same time , you are alone . besides , when you want to pay for the things you have taken , you can believe that the ladies behind the cashdesks are unable to smile . after that , you have to carry your bag ( of course far too heavy for you ) to your car . when you are at home , there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again .

i suggest to film our english lessons and math lessons . from activities i suggest to film sport lessons . and music lessons . we have very interesting english lessons . they are always funny and nice . we always learn something new . at some lessons students are always work , but us we work , joke , discuss many topics , tell some stories about our life . students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial . it's not true . we practice our english and i think we have to film our english lessons , so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do . also math . lessons are so interesting . many people don't like math because they think that it's boreing subject . i think it's all depends of teacher . our math . teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons . i think we should film the math . lessons , so students and some teachers will change their opinion about math . for activities we should film sport lessons because we always do something new . we do many competitions with other schools , and we always have fun . our music lessons are speccial . we try to play on many instruments , sing even if we don't know how . and it's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that .

we are all customers of the big supermarkets . they have all that we need . they are a bit far from town but they have huge car parks . they give us lots of choice to buy what we need and what we can try for . 
also they give lots of sale for everything even you can join their club for extra discount . it look wonderful does not it . 
also they have lots of sales special offers on everything , you can even join their clubs for extra discount . it looks seems wonderful doesn't it ? 
but when we thing properly shopping is not enjoyable for example if you forget something that need for salat . you have to go back this supermarket and find nearest parking space then before someone takes the their last fresh lemon for your salat you must find where was the lemon section before because they love change the store again and again . when you get your lemon you have to go to queue to lemons money . 
but when we think about it seriously , shopping is not enjoyable , for example , if you forget something that you need for a salad . you have to go back to the supermarket and find the nearest parking space , then before someone takes the last fresh lemon for your salad , you must find out where is the lemon section the lemon section is , because they love to change the store around again and again . when you get your lemon you have to go to queue to pay for the lemon .

first of all , we cleared all the seats . there were so many seats that it took long to finish clearing . before the concert started , we sold some snacks and drinks and after that , we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward . during the concert , all the fans try to get closer to the singers , jumping , shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get to excited . we move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans .

in the first i do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty . if you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch , doing shopping is a terrible activity .

on the other hand if you can walk without anytime problem with a good friend i think that shopping is very enjoyable . for istance , it is funny enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt although you do not buy anything . 
on the other hand if you can walk around without any time problem with a good friend i think that shopping is very enjoyable . for instance , it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt although you do not buy anything . 
to sum up i enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not . i often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends . in my opinion , shopping is relaxing above all on saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful sunday .

people often have very different opinions about shopping . most women and girls like it , especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes . a man usually is less interested in shopping , maybe because he frequently has to pay what his wife has bought . 
people often have very different opinions about shopping . most women and girls like it , especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes . a man is usually less interested in shopping , maybe because he frequently has to pay for what his wife has bought . 
in my opinion , shopping can be interesting in big stores , where you can find everything , or in shops which sell something special or strange . on the contrary , i don't like going to shops where you see only common things , and i hate it when there is a lot of crowd . in this case , you have to stay in long queues , you can't walk without being pulled or pushed , and you often have to spend a hour to buy some soap or a packet of biscuits . even if you are with a friend , you can't talk , because of the noise and the confusion , and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other .

we arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order , so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate place . 
i was very nervous because i'd never been in a concert before and an hour before everything stated the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't avoid it and i started crying - you can imagine , they were so handsome that i couldn't belive it - i tried to calm down because i had to work , and later i began feeling more comfortable and when the concert started everything was such exciting that the time ran very fast - although i was working - and it was like a dream .

people like doing shopping ( aspecially in poland , where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened ) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hipermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for their cars , motors or computers . people all over the world like going to do shopping with friends of families ( it's easier to choose the really needed things for kitchen or bathroom , to get something tasty for dinner , lunch or breakfast ) .

but some people don't like doing shopping at all . the reasons are; distance , lack of car , crowded streets , traffic on the way to the shop . they can say , , shopping is not enjoyable'' because they prefer to order clothes and food in catalogues or in the pizza hut restaurant situated on the corner . they are too lazy for walking and looking for something nice for birthday present or flowers for girl-friends . on the other hand - it's very comfortable to seat at home , call and wait for the order realisation . people , who don't like shopping have their own reasons of this situations ( maybe they had an accident with a rude shop-assistance , bought not fresh food one day and do not want to do that any more , had bad experience with other people in shops ) . they don't like shopping either because of the weather ( sometimes it's too hot or too cold for going outside ) .

more and more people like shopping now . you can see so many people walk along the business street every day and any time , especially in oxford street . sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people's working speed . but is it always enjoyable ? 
of course not . the most obvious example is that when you're shopping in the shop you're not sure which one you are going to buy , you turn to the people who sell them , but they sometimes ignore you . so you like them but you don't want them any more . it makes you angry !

sometimes unfortunatelly shopping could be very annoying , especially at christmast or easter time . then , all shops and supermarkets are crowded . people are trying to buy as many things as they can , and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there ! people are pushing each other , they are not as kind as usually . you have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves ( they know they can steal something without having been seen ! ) at christmas or easter time all shops have usually an unpleasant smell ( because of the crowd ) and are very noisy !

next , not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money ! when i go to the big supermarkets i always spend more than i was going to . you just cannot refuse buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you ? ! i always become very angry with myself afterwards , but i cannot help it .

in my opinion , shopping could be really enjoyable ! the only advice would be: " do not do your shopping at christmast or easter time " - but it will not make any sense , will it ? so you just have to get used to it , and enjoy your shopping for the rest time of the year !

yesterday , i received your letter . it made me happy and i would like to thank you for the opportunity you are offering me . 
first of all i would like to travel in july . i think that this is the most ideal month for a trip to california . this period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities . about the accomodation i would prefer to stay in a cabin . i think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes . the two activities i have chosen is swimming and climbing . i selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and i'm good enough t this sector . in addition i would like to swim in a sea like california's because it is clean and beautiful . i chose climbing because i'm intrested in this sport even if i'm not experienced . i like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action .

as you asked me i will write you about the experience i had helping at the pop concert . all the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful enough . before the concert i helped in carring and putting in order some chairs on which would sit some special persons . it was very hard and at the end i was very tired . at the concert , what i had to do was to give out refreshments and drinkings to the audience . i also helped to clear up the place after the concert .

according to your letter i have two options of accommodation , or in tents or log cabins . i would prefer in tents because i think that is something more exciting and new for me . i never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , in my life so i would prefer something more realistic and new . log cabins may be more confortable , on the other hand i think that i will be able to " survive " in tents . looking to your letter , i can see many options of activities and i realized that i like most of them . i think i would prefer climbing and painting . the reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast itselves , i want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint . climbing is something new for me and i am not so good on that , however i wish that i can learn about it on the camp . painting is something that i love and i am very good doing it .

you asked me to wite about my experience which i made by helping at the pop-concert . and i can say it was terrific ! my job was actually to listen to tim and do whatever he said . this included to clean up the rooms which were used by the singers and put some equipment on the stage . tim was in charge of organising this concert . i had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms , in which singers dress and make-up , are actually small . can you imagine , i could stay at this concert without paying anything ! and i managed to speak to ricky martin out of stage . o . k . , i actually asked him only: 'how are you ? ' and he gave me his signature . he was fantastic , you know that he is my favourite singer . i think this was my best job as a student in cambridge . probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do , but you see many stars out of stage . and you might manage to speak to some pop-stars . beside this , i earned some money , not a lot but enough for me .

when i arrived there , the staff were already busy . at first i just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones , and tuning guiters . when i was doing it , one of the staff called me and brought me to a room . he explained me that it was to controll the light . it was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights . however , when it came to the real concert , it was very hard .

1 . the fully-equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly good . lessons are very interesting and full of fun . our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well . however , there are no enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs . i suggest to increase the number of them , because it will be more exiting to film .

many people " see " at shopping like an amusement , but i think it's not always a good translation to give it . in my opinion to do shopping is often funny , above all when you can enter without difficulties into a shop . for exemple , if the shop is full of people , is not enjoyable , because they will create too confusion , too noise with the risk of leaving time . shopping is a funny thing to do , not when you are in a hurry , but when you have free time and when you can relax yourself . another thing that regardes me , is that i enjoy my self more when i know i have to do shopping for me than when it's for my parents or for somebody else ! ! !

people are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar . it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch a movie after that , and , if you want , buy something at the shops . 
on the other hand , everything at the shopping is more expensive , because the people that buy on it usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops , because all they need it is already at this place .

firstly , since more and more people go shopping , shops are always so crowded , especially the popular ones . try to imagine the scence : twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room . would you say that shopping is enjoyable ? would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a t-shirt ?

secondly , the cost is also a problem . it will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it . one of my friend , emma , happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105 . then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money . after a week , she had got enough money and rushed to that shop . but it was just not there ! she felt really badly after that . so , would you still say that shopping is enjoyable ?

most of us would agree on that . who has never had a bad experience related with an unsatisfactory product ? moreover , who has the freedom to buy with an unlimited budget whatever they need ? and finally who has all the time needed to do so ?

shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you appreciate is very satisfying and enjoyable , but it can also be a real nightmare .

you often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product . after long hours of hesitation , you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price . frustrated , you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers . there , you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat . it is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier .

the concert sarted at 6:00 pm until 2:00 am , and i started to work at 12:00 pm to prepare the stage with the musicians . 
after that , at 2:00 pm , when people arrived , i was at the entrance to take the tickets and you know it was incredibale because some people slept all the night in front of the stadium to be in the front row . there were maybe 50 , 000 spectators for this show , it was amazing . when the concert started i had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene . i also helped to serve people who would like drink , i was like a barman . i saw old people , child . . . . and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting , because i met a lot of people and the best thing was that i knew the pop group who sang , it was fantastic . if i had an other opportunity to do that i think that i will do .

as you know , i've not been keen on pop music - i've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish . it was not until the concert that i became a pop mania . it was really great to have talked with famous pop singers , bands , and tv stars . when a member of venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of electric shock on his finger , i felt i was short of breath . we usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty , but they weren't at all . it was absolutely our prejudice . they were very kind , soft , well-behaved , even modest . their attitudes towards people , their costumes , their songs - everything was really fantastic . fortunately there were few emergency accident so i could enjoy the concert without a hurry . i was definitely over the moon !

is shopping not always enjoyable ? there are different opinions and points of view . 
i like shopping very much . firstly , you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food . for example , large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat . even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals . on the other hand , some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products , which are quite unhealthy , but very expensive .

the second thing i like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style buying clothes in the small boutiques . you can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants , which does not necessarily cost you extra money . however , someone else may say , it takes too much time .

the third reason i enjoy shopping is that i never go alone just to buy a thing i need . i always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe . although my brother thinks the better way to have fun is to watch tv than to be pushed in crowded shops , i do not agree .

i was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town . the organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people , who does art , to help decorate the stage . me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see ! everyone was so jealous in the school .

when we got there , there were very many people . people were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments for the concert . we were all given different sort of jobs to do . some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes . it was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much . however the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage . at the end we were given free concert tickets and got autobiographies from our favourite pop singers .

i bet you want to know everything about my great experience at luna pop's concert last month . before that i had never thought i would play with a famous group . but maybe you want to hear the story from the beginning . 
as you know luna pop is not my favourite group and i went to their concert only because ake needed being accompanied . when we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band . it didn't sound very exciting to me but i accepted above all because i was curious . unfortunately what i found wasn't what i expected . everyone was upset , worried or angry and lucre , ake's boyfriend , explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play . in that moment ake exlaimed that i could play the piano . after that i tried to tell them i had just begun but within five minutes i was on the stage and i was playing that , luckily , easy tune .

i think you can't believe in what i've told you but i won't forget this experience . this has been the first time i have realized that , maybe , playing the piano could be my future and , even though i was really frightened , i enjoyed staying on the stage with all those eyes on me .

the truth of shopping

shopping . . . a great and emotion statement , don't you think ? every one think that shopping in the best way to carry off your problems and , in fact a big solution of many problem or estrés , boring , or only for distraction . 
shopping . . . a great and emotional statement , don't you think ? everyone thinks that shopping is the best way to get rid of your problems and , in fact a big solution to many problems or estrés , boring , or only for distraction . 
but the question is: why shopping is not always enjoyable ? . for many people , shopping had always been only for one kind of elite , or social class; not all people can go shopping and buy hundreds and thousands of stuff in those big malls as distraction . let's talk about women; nightmare ! women can't resist the fact of shopping and they are dissapointed when they don't have the wants to shop .

the shopmania is really unstapped . i know women that make everything they can to buy only a dress , or even worst , women that buy things that was nothing to do with them , for example , snap , esculptures , kitchen tissues , or eveything on telemarketing that really are unuseful , but the fact of have it " there " they can resist they can not resist the fact of it " being there . "

there are many facts to prove that shopping is not " pretty and armonious " , but believe me , is not always enjoyable .

i think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people , especially at the weekends which normally is the only appropreaite time ! not only shops are crowded with people , the changing rooms have enormous queue . the clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size . these things can be very annoying but there is a good side of 'shopping' .

i do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but i am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and i am sure that in the future , there will be no more crowded streets because of the ' internet ' which you can order onlines . maybe we will have robots to do the shopping for us in the future !

shopping is not always enjoyable
shopping is not always enjoyable
i think shopping is not always an enjoyable thing because there are a lot of things which are not good . for example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping , and a part of this money is only for buying the necessaryiest things like bread and other things to eat . i enjoy shopping when i can buy some clothes .

also a problem while the shopping is that most there are so many people and a lot of traffic in all shopping-centres . all the people are there most on the same day because there are not a lot of other possibilities for shopping while the week for the employees . 
also a problem with shopping is that most of the time there are too many people and a lot of traffic in all the shopping centres . all the people are there mostly on the same day because there are not a lot of other opportunities for shopping during the week for workers . 
i think one possibility is to buy your things on the internet , because then you have not to invest a lot of time for buying all this things , and they bring you the things at home in the end i think it is the best if you have the possibility to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed .

title: speaking activity
i like speaking activity while i am in the class . during that time i can talk some secret things or private with class-mates . after that we know each other more than before . in addition speaking activity include everything to learn english such as listening , speaking , grammer as well . other lesson , the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammer , english culture . . . etc . it might be good . however all students are passive . so it can be boring . give a topic and then discussion about it . i know that what my friends think and like . it is real life who we are . also the film must be funny . if a film is boring , nobody will see it . during speaking , there are lots of happening such as , some students can't understand what the other students say and their culture . having fun and knowing new knowledge . it makes us laugh .

right time for shopping
the right time for shopping
why do people like shopping ? first answer is that they need shopping . second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy . if i get bored i can't stay at home and i feel going shopping . when i do shopping i don't think about any problems i have . it's very relaxing for me but if it is possible to do shopping . sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for .

i think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping . i went shopping last week with my friend she needed to buy a nightdress . we spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything . it was incredibly crowded . we couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time .

imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them . i can tell you how bad situation you are in because when i was a child i always had an argument with my mother about shopping . i can remember how upset i was if my mother didn't buy what i wanted and how much i cried . it was very ashameful for my mum . she was also very angry . because she never managed to get me out from the toy shop .

" cry freedom " 
" cry freedom " 
if you are used to reading a lot , you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'this is such a marvellous book i will want to read it again' . " cry freedom " , from john briley , is one of these books . but why should we read this book twice ? 
if you are used to reading a lot , you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'this is such a marvellous book i will want to read it again' . " cry freedom " , by john briley , is one of these books . but why should we read this book twice ? 
firstly , the story takes place in south africa , during the period of the appartheid . the political and historical background is very interesting , but also complicated . i think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time . and by understanding the book , you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries . 
firstly , the story takes place in south africa , during the period of apartheid apartheid . the political and historical background is very interesting , but also complicated . i think that you can't understand all the links between the events without reading the book more than once . and by understanding the book , you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries . 
however , i think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: donald woods and steve biko . both of them symbolize courage , love of justice , fight for freedom , which makes them look like heroes . just as the greeks and the romans , our modern society has mythes , and " cry freedom " is one of them .

in my last letter i promised to write you about my experience working at pop-concert . the job came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event . so she asked me to fill her position . even i had planned something else to do i agreed because she's my very good friend . 
in my last letter i promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert . the job came unexpectedly as my friend , who was supposed to work there , broke her leg just two days before the event . so she asked me to fill her position . even though i had planned something else to do i agreed because she's my very good friend . 
the concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning . first i was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning i was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians , technicians and others who worked there . it was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but i saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them .

when they started to play i was told to change my post again . this time i was helping the medical workers who had full hands with fainted teenage girls . first , it seemed to me odd because i didn't understand why they faint , but as the concert went on , the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted . it wasn't funny anymore and i didn't know what to do first . i was really shocked by the view of crying and shaking but absolutely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor .

after having visited shops during 10 hours and tried at least 2 , 000 shoes , i finally found what i was looking for . the shoes of my dreams ( well designed and not too expensive ) so i went back to the station , very proud of me with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face .

as you know i helped at a pop concert last month , i did things as unusual in me as cleaning instruments , organise people , and also look after the clothes of the artists . in fact everything was very easy , the instruments were already clean , and with the clothes my job was only wait there and give them what they asked for . organise people involved , just a couple of things , say to people how to do the same as me and when .

it is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries . many people leave so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford . let us then ask: 'is this activitie always enjoyable ? '

nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that , to do so , you do not need to make any effort . far from the strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require , going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money .

however , this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then , if you do go , you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people , unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people . nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her .

i find shopping is the most time consuming . if i want to buy a nice pair of shoe , i'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until i find the shoes i like . if i'm not lucky enough to find one , then i'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as london .

whilst in london ; i'll be facing crowds and people will be rushing everywhere . to walk around london streets looking for a pair of shoe can definitely be a tiring task . as i'm a compulsive buyer , i'd probably ended up buying other things as well .

it was terrible ! we have a lot of problems from the beggining . the first one was the security . people in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to . if it weren't a calm and quite public , we would have had troubles . another problem was the band . they didn't want to play until the room were crowded . so that concert started an hour and a half latter .

everything was all right during the perform of the band , but at the end some espectators came up to the stage and made some damage to the band's instrument . the singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out immediately leaving the public without the last part of the show .

as you can see , hardly anything went well , but the lights and the sound - both in wich i helped carrying things - were appropriate for the concert . althought all these things , i gained a lot of experience and i could be near one of my favourite pop stars , which was the better experience i've ever had .

shopping sounds very enjobleable and fantastic for women . you can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected . some people enjoy window shopping , but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes . nowadays in a family shopping isn't women's job .

in other hand , after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card . for instance , you want to buy everything which you saw , and after that , you don't know how much you have spent . if you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things . it will be very awful .

however , shopping has pros and cons , it depends on personal thinking . i enjoy shopping very much , it can let me know what's going on in the world . but it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping , you won't feel so tired .

couple of days ago i bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing . she invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite . can you believe that i was introduced to him and i took numerous photographs some of which i put in the envelope . it was like a dream come true , and was the best part of the experience in my opinion . i helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments . despite the fact that i felt exhausted i must admit that it was one of the days i will never forget througout my life

a lot of people like shopping but most of them might tell you that sometimes it is not enjoyable . and nowadays people must go shopping whether they like it or not . 
for people who used to do shopping , going in big stores , i think they like it and they are always looking for fashioned-clothes . but when these stores are full of people , crowded , like the sales period , i am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring .

in my opinion , i think people have to do shopping even though they don't appreciate it very much . if these people have a family with children , they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people . and now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety .

of course it is good to buy things for ourselves , like clothes , jewellery , anything . especially if we don't have to worry about money . it's good to walk around looking at all the new things in the stores . 
but , sometimes , go shopping can have other effects on you . it can stress you . for example , when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around . when you can't find what you are looking for anywhere . when you buy something you were looking for a long time and , when you arrive at home , you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain . it is just terrible when the sellers don't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store . and , a really bad thing is , after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that , you realize that you spent more money than you should . . . 
but , sometimes , going shopping can have other effects on you . it can stress you . for example , when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around . when you can't find what you are looking for anywhere . when you buy something you were looking for a long time and , when you arrive at home , you discover some defect on it and have to go back to the store to complain . it is just terrible when the assistants don't treat us well . sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store . and , a really bad thing is , after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that , you realize that you spent more money than you should have . . . 
so , after all this , i suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it . it would probably be better if you just go shopping when you really need and , to relax , you can talk to a friend , read a book or listen to good music .

i think all people like shopping . when you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they don't like shopping but i suppose it is not true . for example me , when someone asked me about shopping i would say that i hadn't liked it . however now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be " yes , i like it " . when people hear this word shopping they only think about to go some stores and try new clothes or shoes and search for their size and so on . they don't think about other kind of shopping which are liked by themselves . maybe they like shopping on internet or window shopping doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like . there are a lot of shopping style on the world i am sure everybody prefer one of them .

in my opinion , even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable , there are always some fun you can find . you only need to discover what you like , and how you can have fun with shopping .

shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands . there are more and more retailors are opening to customer . therefore , people used to shopping weekly or monthly . 
shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands . there are more and more retailers opening . therefore , people usually go shopping weekly or monthly . 
in my opinion , women are really enjoying shopping . it seems a human activity during their spare time . however , we are going to change traditional system to the " e-shopping " . it is new for customers by technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want . therefore , it looks like a service and also boring for customer . i think most of gentlemen dislike shopping . they are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping .

then i'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at camp california . i think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others . however , during my stay at camp , there are two activities i can choose , one of them i will choose basketball because it is the sport i play most , i and my friend used to win the first place in school-wide match when we was in school . and the other one , i think painting will be a good idea; painting is one of my hobbies and i've been learning it since i was 5 years old and now i'm still doing it once i have free time .

it was a pop concert by steps in the m . e . n arena . and i was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean . 
a few minutes after the concert began , a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable , if something comes up , she should inform other staff . i was then taken in to cover her job . i couldn't find my feet at first as i was so nervous . i was given lots of paper with many different time on it . i did manage to " study " them though , thanks to other staff . they were very helpful and nice . they patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves . then i found it was not as complicated as i though before . and i guess i did a good job as everything was getting on quite well .

shopping is not always enjoyable because of different problems . 
the first thing is the place of shopping . sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time . the second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open . many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping . the third thing is the trouble of full shops . everybody do their shopping at the same moment and often in the same place . it is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying those things . people are often nervous and agressive . sometimes you can see fights between two men or women .

, , shopping is not always enjoyable " . from my point of view it is a very controversial issue , and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not . it only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account . some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable . luckily , i'm one of these people . first of all , shopping is a waste of time . people just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy . during the rush hour , shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area . i just can't understand people who with smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things . they are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous .

i think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in july . this is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in america . this trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays , as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience .

between the tent and log cabin , i think that i would prefer the tent . it will let me get up and close with nature , and experience life in the wild . living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills , making this a trip to remember .

the concert was held at our school hall . all the students had to help to brighten up the place , and boy did we work . i helped to decorate the walls . my friends and i managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old , faded green . it wasn't as easy as i had expected , there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result .

most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable for different reasons and places . 
in the first place , some housewifes don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second . to make matters worse , you forget to buy something when you get back home . it is very frustrating . moreover , if you go with your children , you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket . it is a tough chore !

another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want . sometimes when you meet a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no your size left . i cannot imagine anything worse .

the other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay everything buy credit card . when a bill comes to £1000 , you would be shocked and regret what you had done .

i often shop with no problems , but on saturday is not the same . shops are so crowded and it takes long time to find what we want and what we need . also we got to face a long queue in order to pay . spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people . i find it very tiring sometimes .

'cry freedom' is about the blacks and whites of south africa . the main characters of this book are stephen biko , a black leader , and donald woods who is a white newspaper editor . woods is thought to stand for all white people and this book could have an influence on them . 
in the first part of this book it can be seen woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them . in some ways , he did not agree with " black consciousness " which is biko's organization because it was too much against the whites . woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals , but after he had met biko and visited a black township , he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live . the people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him . finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist , in other words , he became an activist for the black people of south africa .

although biko was killed and woods himself was declared a banned person , i would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because woods succeeded in escaping from south africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about south africa to the world .

i'm not dare to culculate how much i have spent for those things without thinking . however , it was not bad , my mom always told me that i hadn't have earned enough money so that i shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way . 
i would not dare to calculate how much i have spent on those things without thinking . however , it was not bad . my mum always told me that i hadn't earned enough money so i shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way . 
therefore , people who is over 18 can think of more reasons than young children for shopping and buying such tempting objects . to sum up , shopping is not a wrong thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know what you are spending it for !

in my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford . i know people who are overdrawn because of shopping . despite shopping is boring i think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment .

the day of the show i worked so hard that i couldn't see the spectacle . and i didn't even got paid . but it was worthy . i found my reward when the concert finished . after been carrying stuff like lights , microphones , wires and some other equipment for about three hours , i was eshausted . but when britney came out of the stage , she passed by me , saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room . we talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss . i won't forget that moment ever . write me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me . bye .

from my point of view , the real question is: who said that is enjoyable ? maybe for women , but not for me . i know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it's what really happens . for men , sometimes is hard to go shopping with their partners . sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town . and of course , we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like . the sports shop . you cannot lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive . and that is allways what we want . that's men's intention .

another point is to go a big area . specially week-ends . everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around . people should have to take a license to drive those things . someone could be injured . and of course , the time to pay . a huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out . in conclusion , for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .

i hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it . in my opinion , it dependes on your mood , your financial ability , off course where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy . 
i hate shopping but on the other hand sometimes you can have fun doing it . in my opinion , it depends on your mood , your financial situation , of course , where you are going to go shopping and what you are going to buy . 
usualy people don't have time for shopping . you've just finished your long hours at work , you tide , you had row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping . and what you have . there are huge queus to tills , noise , hussle , poor custumer service . you've got more stress , you feel fed up and finaly when you got home you think that shopping is not that enjoyable as you thought . 
usually people don't have time for shopping . you've just finished your long hours at work , you are tired , you had a row with your boss but you are still going to go shopping . and what do you have ? there are huge queues to the tills , noise , hassle , poor customer service . you've got more stress , you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought . 
for example a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores . it takes hours to buy something . there are so many varaity of products , different prices , different quality . you should walk miles around store to find what you wanted . yes , there is big plus for big store of course . you can find everything in one place , instead of small shops which is specialised on one product . and people spend all weekends walking around shopping cities and high streets in trills to buy something .

nower days tecnical progress gets close to us , to usual custumers . internet is one of the issue at this problem . without any hussle , seating in your chear in front of your computer you in second can get in at any shop who has internet site , most of the big companies have it , get all information about product , get cheaper price and buy it .

the best way to go shopping is when you think in advance what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend . if people would think about it before going shopping , they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought .

shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before christmas , for example . there is no way to find good prices ! shops are crowded , items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking .

first of all because of the big variety in the store . very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as nike , adidas or fila .

of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping isn't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal . that means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and noone to complaine . that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in little stores , where i have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about .

the concert i helped at last week was the greatest experience i've ever had . 
i mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage . you know , although i'm a pop music fan , i'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening . first , they asked me to put those instruments on the stage . i left the hi-fi system on the left side ( it should be on the other side ) . before opening , the pop star found the mistake , otherwise it would be a disaster .

the performer , paul , is a big music name at the present . but i'd never met him before . this time , i saw him in person . i told him i loved his songs , he was very happy . then , we stroke a lovely conversation . afterwards , he gave his pen for my enthusiasm .

in order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city , the coun council organised an open air concert . it was a summer night and all the citizens , as well as tourists , had the opportunity to attend . the pop band " five " arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also the stages and sound . i knew some help was needed so i decided to speak to the manager . i couldn't believe when he said: " o . k . if you want to help , here is a list of what you can do . " my job was to leave some leaflets on shops , restaurants and streets .

i would like to go to the trip in july because my school , which is berkeley international school , is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students . other reason is i think in july the weather is not so cold . the weather condition will be suitable for camping . i prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and i can get closer to the nature . every night i would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent . although , living in the tent is more comfortable . i'll have to be aware about insects so i've bought so many insects repellant . i can choose to do 2 activities so i would like to play tennis and swimming . when i was in fourth form , i got the first prize in swimming competition and third prize in tennis . i was a bit disapotted with the result because i was expected to win the first prize or secound price .

i had to help them behind the state , while they were get dressed . i had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones was working properly . although the work was not heavey , i gained a lot of experience . they gave me their signature and when the concert started , they told me to come up on the state and dance with them . i was really embarassed because i had to dance in front of a lot of people but that is the very good experience i have ever had . i was really enjoy at the concert . thing that i particularly like in the concert is i got a free ticket from westlife to go to the a1 concert which is another well known band . i really want to have that experience again .

firstly , i am a student , i don't have job , so , i have to asked money from my parents . i can't asked too much that's very bad for my parents . when i go shopping . i alway feel shame because i spend my parents money . ( although i got part-time job , it just enough to pay my rent . )

secondly , if you live in a big city , the things always expensive . you should spend more money on buying clothes and food , you will very happy when you buy it , but , when you come back home take out you purse , you must be feel sad , you purse nearly empty , ( when you don't have enough money . )

sometimes , when you shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you can't buy it once , you will feel very sad maybe . and then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things what you like so funny isn't it ?

as all the students are different from each other , it is essential to show many aspects of the school . therefore , to show the good aspects , i suggest to film mr. clark's english classes , because they are highly educative and because the students participate a lot . on the other hand , to show less pleasing aspects , it would be adequate to film mrs . morrison's french classes , as they are extremely boring and sub-standard .

many classes and activities are important in our school but i have to make a choice in order to select them the class of mecanics seem to be the more important lesson . it use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes . it gives us the knowledge usefull for many school club like the " marathon shell " club or the robotich club . besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier it lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer . but there are other lessons very important ( like english of course ! ) actually , i have a regret , there is no ethic lessons , it would show us how use our knowledge .

our school , as it is well known , is a technical school and consequently the daily life contains different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories . a short video , showed to the english class , must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school . here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to create the video . the mathematical lessons are divided in two part : the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained . two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistry . in the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant . in the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated . these activities are very interesting and they will be surely enclosed in the video .

the good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure , provided you are not in a hurry . 
on the other hand , when the shops are crowded ( for instance , just before christmas ) , going shopping can be very stressful , as you cannot walk freely and have to bear endless queues . another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets , which is very common when they are full of people . as if these were not enough , there are always impolite assistants , who make your day even worse .

it was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people : herself and the houskeeper . although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it . i think that her husband only followed what she ordered him . she was the head in this story . the plan was almost perfectly and the police hadn't discovered the murderer without the help of mr. poirot .

in my opinion mrs . havering was a extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense . moreover she must have had an " ice blood " and strong nerves to handle in that way .

shopping is not always enjoyable
shopping is not always enjoyable
i love shopping . but i can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable . 
i love shopping . but i can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable . 
for example , any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends . sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins . what's worse , there is usually traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall . and if an accident takes place on the roads , it can be a nightmare . so i prefer shopping at weekdays unless i am busy or have an appointment .

however , people can't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping . shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get . in addition , they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service .

sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything . but of course , there are some exceptions . for example , when you buy something , you might lose it and never again see it , or you could be robbed , or even if the product has something wrong with it , then you have to swap it and that takes time .

another bad thing is that people want something very badly , and they can't afford it . that makes those people frustrated and they don't enjoy theirselves .

first of all , i don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley ( which , by the way , has it's own idea of where it want's to go ) between other desperate people baskets , just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste . especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern , huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores . secondly , if you happen to forget something , you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers , and that can take up even more time . but the worst thing comes at the end . your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout ( where you can easily spend another 30 minutes ) where they will suck out some money from your account . where's the fun in that ?

i have given a questionnaire to other students of my class to know their preferences about this choise and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy . the reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good in explaing problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject . also the sports-activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school-life and can be useful to see and check out the moviments of the bodys during the atletics-school games .

i went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band . it was so easy , a mean we just carried all the instruments from the musicians to the club and we put it on the stage . after this , we helped to the service bar to put into the fridges all drinks and refreshments . and that was it ! i enjoyed a lot doing this and at least the gig was free for all of us . the concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out . marevellous !

shopping is not always enjoyable
shopping is not always enjoyable
well this is abosolutly true , espacially when you go shopping on saturday . everyone goes shopping on saturday so the mall is always crowed , and most of the people are stressed , it's crazy . for exemple you go into a cloth shop , you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt , so they are looking every where , pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want . and then they have and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose . and you have to wait after to buy it , so finally you waited so long that you are getting late , so you get stressed to . so it's really not enjoyable to go shopping . plus most of the time , you see all those mothers looking after their kids , and yelling their name's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them . so you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying , the mothers yelling , if i can give you an advice: don't go shopping on saturday ! ! you get headaches , you get stressed , and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you ! ! !

really ? sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare . firstly is the parking problem , if you go to shopping late at weekends for instance , it's really difficult to find a place to park your car , and when you get the place , pay for it ! then the search for a nice cloth starts , and when eventually you get it , it isn't your size , but also the colour that you like is not available . finally you've found out something really wonderful , time to pay !

with the hurries you've forgotten to bring any cash , but you can use the plastic money , the shop assistant pass the credit card through the machine , after few seconds again , and another time more , suddenly his face changes and says you that the card is fault ! no choice , you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad .

to sum up , shopping is not always enjoyable , but don't worry , the shooping center still there waiting for you !

at first , they asked me to decorate the stage since i like drawing , but as i wanted to get more involved , they said that i could also help them set up the lights , the microphones and the instruments . i have to admit that it wasn't always easy , but my effort was worth every penny .

the concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous ! the audience seemed pretty impressed as well . i thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together . i'm not sure of what part you're interested in , but i think drawing the background for the stage was the best , and i suggest that you try doing it too .

certenly the only fact of have something can helps people to be more sure of himself . in fact if you have the new kalvin klein model for a certain kind of people you are cool , but it is really so important ? 
certainly only the fact of having something can help people to be more sure of themselves . in fact if you have the new kalvin klein product to a certain kind of person you are cool , but is it really so important ?

it's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable . probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you can't have it . another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present . everybody know that , , present presents a problem'' you know your own task but what vith a task of the other person ?

but the cherry on the cake was that i met one of the handsome singers back stage ! he asked me what i was doing and so on and finally invited me for his next concert ! of course i agreed - i wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun ! perhaps i could help regularly in the lightening area - it would help me for my studies of photography . what do you reckon ?

generally , most people like shopping , but there are some advantages and disadvantages . 
when discribing the advantages , we should remember that most people like doing shopping . it is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding , birthday , christmas presents . next , it can be very good for your wallet to save some money , when you will find a bargain or sales . as well as that , some shop-assistance can give you a lower price , because you always do shopping at their shop . what is more , most people cannot live without shopping . it is their way to spend free time .

on the other hand , there are some minuses . on top of that , shopping is very tiring and exhausting . walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags , takes much of your time . instead of that you could do more interesting things . such as playing sports or reading a book . besides that , shopping steal you from money . very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need .

in my opinion shopping is very tiring and i usually try to avoid doing it . when i have to , i do it , but i think we waste too much time on it that we should . on balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something . from my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not .

" wuthering heights " by emile brönte i think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man . besides that , this character is more interesting than others due to his complex mind and his deep evil manners . it's the richest character at all , his name is heathcliff , and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters . they are always suffering the revenge that heathcliff swear , cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in . from this point of view i think heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper . he's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but the others character make him become thus . this revenge links the story so without it we would not have such " wuthering heights " . i sympathize with heathcliff because i think every bad character is a very important point of every book , film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them .

why can shopping be unenjoyable ? 
why is it that shopping is sometimes unenjoyable ? 
first of all , it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for . 
first of all , it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for . 
some people are boring to shop with , they don't talk or comment anything they see . why would anyone shop with that type of person ? well , i really don't know . women , in perticular , have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see . if it is something they like , they always have to try it on . we all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes ( usually several ) but it's still better than when we're talking about shoes ! that has to be the worst . seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when being bored , but shoes are just shoes . shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance . it seems to last forever and just when you think she's done , she spots an othe pair .

it happened to me once that i wanted to go on holidays , so i went to the travel agency . in the front there were some good advertisement about holidays which were very cheap . i really liked one of them concernent to spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included , but for £250 . i went inside to asked for that packet but they told me that it was gone , therefore , i went to many shoops just to find the same answer . any of the adver . in the windows were available . however , the most important thing is when i asked them to take that adver . of the didn't do it .

for the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes , cosmetic , accesories , jewels etc . and the other they choose sometimes just for the label . without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area , because people in general they don't spent the time for prepare food and when they shopping they choose pre-prepared food . we know is more easy for these busy life .

for frank , i like to shopping . of course not because of buying things . i like to have window shopping that is good to go arround the shopping area . it would help you up to the date . what fashion is hit now . 
for frankly frankly , i like to shop . of course not because of buying things . i like to go window shopping that is good to go around the shopping centre . it helps you keep up to date . with what with what fashion is in now . 
but , when during any peak season , like christmas , holidays or even during weekends . then i can say i'm definatly doesn't feel any enjoyable . because of the crowd . for me i think , it is not shopping that is kind of suffering . especially , queue up for twenty minutes for just paying the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting your the right size of clothes . so sometimes i don't think shopping is enjoyable , and if there is any big festival , i would rather stay at home and watch television .

first of all we can't go shopping without money . nowadays , most product's prices has gone up with our own country's economy development . despite the poor material of product , we have to pay much money , even though we completely satisfied shopping at that time , we sometimes regret buying after the shopping . it sounds like foolish . however it often happen .

most people enjoy shopping . but not me . i think shopping is hard , exhausting work , especially when you are trying to buy yourself some new clothes . 
the most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular stuff for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you . eventually , after long seeking you find a skirt you like . but it doesn't fit . you get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one . and finally , after a few more hours , you buy the skirt of your dreams . and suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop . accident like that can really make you livid . at last you come back home , carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town . you phone your friend to visit you and your friend come , wearing the skirt not unlike the one you have just bought .

my best friend is crazy about shopping . she will prefer shopping to everything else . she thinks that it is the most pleasant spending of time , when you going from one shop to another , watching other people , looking at beautiful clothes , getting some fashionable ideas . somitimes i feel very sorry for her . it seems that going shopping is a sense of living . and it's so many people like her . lots of families planing a day out to go to a shopping center , and it is a normal routine for them - to spent the all day just shopping . not so many people thinking about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more . they forgot how beautiful could be the countryside , and only tourists you can meet in the castles or museums .

people are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied . people are not smiling to each other , not talking to each other at the shops . they look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy .

actually i didn't use to enjoy pop music much . my classmate cecilia persuaded me to try whole new experience of helping at a pop concert . i thought it would be the last thing i wanted , but it wasn't . i've really enjoyed this opportunity . we delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers . we also helped to make posters and leaflets , which i enjoyed most as i always like drawing and designing .

the most difficult work was to arrange coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience from countryside . it was too complicated . but the rest of the preparation was so good . i've realised pop stars are just like us , down to earth . they were so kind and modest . do you know what i liked most from this experience ? i've found pop music so wonderful , it changed my idea of that classic music is always best . of course , i've enjoyed being around famous singers , too .

firstly , i would like to inform that i prefer travelling in july to travelling in another month . the reason for it , is that , july is the only month in which , i am on holidays so i will not have to miss any classes . next , i would prefer stay in tents rather than stay in log cabins because i appreciate having straight contact with nature . therefore , i have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which i am good at . i can say i am good at swimming , because in the club i used to be the first in all the competitions and climbing i used to climb trees , walls everything in my childhood without falling .

wonderful , breathtaking , fabulous , these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was . starting with good points , i could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars . moreover , you have the unique opportunity to take pictures with them , to have their names written , on your notebook by themselves . despite of being tiring , it was rewarding because i noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true i experienced that . another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money . don't worry because you don't pay your ticket it is " free " . from my point of view , there were not disadvantages .

sometime when you ask your friend especially girls . what would you like to after the class or during the weekend ? the typical answer would be 'i'm going to shop because i like it even windows shopping would be fine' . however , for me shopping is not always enjoyable . why ? first of all , it's wasting my time especially when i can't find the thing i want , this is very frustrating . in addition , it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want . apart from that , it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one , if possible . once you've got all your shopping list , you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought which is very heavy sometime .

shopping is not always enjoyable
shopping is not always enjoyable
shopping , for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want . for some people it may be a method to relax themselves , after you have been to work or school . so it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time , but still have something you will not enjoy it . it depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping . for example some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life , they won't enjoy this kind of shopping , because it is not getting what they want . the place where you are shopping also very important . for example in hk all the areas have lots of people it won't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping . because have too many people it make you want to stay home won't enjoy shopping .

hello ! i hope everything around you is alright . you might not believe but actually i helped at a pop concert last month and i really enjoyed it so much . so i'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was . all work i needed to do wasn't very interesting . which i must have set thousands chairs correctly and after finishing i put them back nicely . the reason i enjoyed it very much is that i could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing . i was asked if i wanted to sit down in front of stage . naturally i agreed and i could enjoy their gig as audience . it was absolutely fantastic . i had ever never sit down there . additionally , you couldn't believe , but the vocalist said " all the chairs you are sitting down were set from him , " pointing at me ! ! actually i was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory .

next i would film a bwpm lesson . this subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations . they go together in groups , then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers .

it would be also very interesting to film the situation during the break . the smokers in the school yard , the buffet and the other pupils , who are sitting at their tables doing their homework . 
i think then we should film an informatic-lesson . it would be funny to present the computers , which are often overcharged , or often the netserver is spinning . it's really funny to see the helpless teacher , who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text , while the computers do not work or brake down .

first of all , i had to sell tickets for the concert in the street . as i sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me , i won a prize of ten pounds . don't ask me how the concert was ! because during the concert i was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar , preparing sandwiches . i am angry because i couldn't watch the artists performing their songs .

i used to like shopping , but recently i came across many disadvantage of this activity . most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want . it isn't true . nowdays we have many big shopping centers . we like them because everything is on one place . the most suitable time for shopping is weekand when parents don't work and children haven't got a school . because of that shopping centers are over crowded . you can't buy something in peacful and calm athmospher . in addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high , of course not all of them . however such centers are very useful and necessary . i my opinion the worst thing which may happened is extremly hugh queu to the changing room . it is really exhausting . afterwards you are all in . nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable . if you bought something goregous , you would be very happy . on balance i think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have bad mood don't go shopping .

why people like so much go shopping ? 
why do people like to go shopping so much ? 
in my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .

othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as: children , teenagers , men; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school . in that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .

from my point of view , shopping is not always enjoyable , because sometimes when you are looking for a special good you never find it . besides , i do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products , that make you feel confused and you don't know which one fits you , instead of being with my friends or doing something else .

i think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need , if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want . moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes . although it is wonderful to buy new things , there are times that it really become tiring .

to summarize , i could say that if you want to buy something , first make sure what sort of product you need and then , go shopping . if not shopping never be enjoyable , but also tiring and boring .

one day i decided to go to the shopping center which is only 40 meters from our house . firstly , i could not find the entrance . i'd walked arround about 15 minutes until i found the door . i realized that i'd walked so many times in front of the entrance but the door had looked like a window . when i entered into the shope i was a bit angry .

you wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which i enjoyed helping last month ? i must say that was a great fun , i've never had this kind of experience before . before the concert actually started i had to give out lots of leaflets , they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds . after that , i had to help people who had a ticket but can't find their seat . during the concert , i didn't have a lot to do , so i had chance to see most of the performance , that was excellent . i was excited that i had a closer look at so many famous pop stars . during break time i did give a lots of direction to people who can't find toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee . that was bit boring , but it was part of my job .

my job was looking after her when she had a break time . i guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea , and so on . i thought it was most exciting job . actually , i could have a chance to ask her about music , her favorite artist and her hobby . i was impressed when i heard that she liked playing puzzle alone . she seemed to be very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had very gentle attitude when she spoke to me . i became a fan of her .

last month i helped at a pop concert . the name of the band was 'dream comes true' . this band is very famous not only in japan but also in the usa . i am still excited while i am writing to you about my experience . 
first , i helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived . the music instruments were transported from the lorries ( three big lorries ! ) into the concert hall and i helped to put them at the right position on the stage . they were very heavy and i had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band . after that i helped to test lights and microphones . i almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage . i am a fan of this band and i have never seen them in flesh .

in your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins , well i prefer to stay in a log cabin . it is more confortable and i am afraid about wild animals . i saw , you offer a lot of activities , that'is fantastic ! it is very difficult to decide which two of these activities i like and i can also do the best . i think i choose singing because i have sung for five years in a church chorus and i do it very well . the other activity i like very muche is swimming . i took part at a lot of competitions .

last month , i helped at a pop concert which i really enjoyed . the singer , who took place , wasn't one of my favourites , but having the opportunity to experience being stuff there , was just amazing . i was just behind the stage . i was supposed to help my friend with the lights , so that i could see all that screaming like made crowd . i even saw crying girls , who were trying to reach the pop-singer .

do you know what kim , i've never thought before , that enjoying yourself like this , could be weirdly . i think you never realize this , until you're not a part of the crowd . but i'm really happy , that i had even small role in making people enjoying themselves . i mean , all that flashing lights , the changing colours of them , i believe they helped much . even though i was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was , i consider myself being very successful .

and finally , the greatest news . i was introduced to the singer by my friend , who works for him . this was maybe the best part of being there . he was so nice and he even gave me his picture whit his signature on it . i suppose , i will never forget that night .

we could begin the afternoon with the sport , showing the different places with surroundings ( near the wild ) : it would give a good impression . i advise to finish with a lesson of chemistry so that people see the laboratery . before that , i would have showed the break at 3 o'clock which is important for us .

everyone has likes and dislikes . but noone is doing what he likes all the time . there is times that you have to do something even if you don't like it , and times that you are doing what you like but not the time you like it . what i'm trying to say is that i like to shop but i can't do that all the time . first because i'm not so rich and second because i don't enjoy to shop all the time . nothing in life is always enjoyable even the things we enjoy to do , and that's how life is . you say you enjoy shopping i understand but life goes on you can't do the same things every day . live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do different things is exciting and more fun . you don't have to be bored with the same old things .

if you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable , because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things . there are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting . shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes . this happens because people enjoy themselves a lot .

on the other hand there are some disadvantages . for example if you are a working mother with three children , that means you are always n a hurry , going shopping is really unenjoyable . you go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue .

you need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to .

in conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy . otherwise if you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood . you should avoid the peak times .

i'm a shopaholic , but i have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable . for instance , i spent my spring break with my friends in italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation ( besides other reasons ) . they had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .

while we were in florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsie . i was so annoyed ! i was in the plaza espagna in florence without a penny ! my friends lent me some money , but it wasn't more than 120 pounds . i had to buy my dress , it's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs ! i couldn't really do much , so i used the money i had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs . i felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing i could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop .

shopping can be very exciting and fun . the feeling of buying new things is wonderful . but it might not be the same every time . 
we all go shopping , maybe not every day , but certainly at least once a week . shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things . for example , food . you will not be able to survive without food . so buying things neccessary is fine i think . but buying things that do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time , but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them , you might regret buying them . for example you did not plan to buy any crisps , but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking . but after you never eat them and just bin them .

as you asked me some questions , here are the answers . it would be very convenient if i could travel in july , because by that time i'll be on my school holidays . if you agree i would like to have a tent as accommodation , because i have never stayed in one and i wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way i will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area .

it would be very pleasant if i could join your basketball team , since i used to play it in my school's team and i think i'm pretty good at it . surfing would be another good option because i have never stepped on a surfboard and i think this is a beautiful sport .

shopping is not always enjoyable . some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken , with a lot of bills to pay . however , if you don't have those spending sprees very often , shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family .

have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center ? if you answered no , congratulations . but if you took a deep breath after reading the question , don't worry . its normal to have spending sprees . everyone had or will have one while shopping . but don't be afraid .

going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience . it's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves . if you are a good observer , it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date .

in conclusion , if you go shopping reasonably , have a good time . on the other hand , if you think that you'll be on the red , i'd better stay at home .

it was supposed to start at ten , but when the band was going on stage , the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights ! suddenly , everything got very dark . the fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin , while i just stood there trying to see what had happened . then , a security guard started calling for help . i happened to be near him , so i went to help him . he asked me to help bono , the leader , get up and to get him some water . i realised he had broken a finger so i had to get a doctor to help him . there was an ambulance behind the stage , so the paramedic came right away and took care of bono's finger . like an hour later , he recovered and the show began .

shopping is not always enjoyable
i agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop in the center of a big town . these shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example . in such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers , what is not enough when a shop is full of people . that's a place where you lose too much of time and health . 
i agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shops in the centre of a big town . these shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example . in such shops there is usually one or one or two sales assistants , which is not enough when a shop is full of people . that's a place where you lose too much time and health . 
shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket , because there is smaller crowd and more sellers work there . in these days people prefere shopping at supermarkets than at shops or even shopping areas , because shopping at shop is less enjoyable and you spent the same amount of money .

i am replying to your letter about the first prize in the competition that i won and there are a number of things i would like to make clear . 
you asked me in your last letter when i would like to travel . i think the best time is the first two weeks of july , because i will be free then . i cannot travel earlier because i take an examination and i have to study for it . in addition , i would prefer to have a log cabin , because i am not used to sleeping in a tent , so it would be very difficult for me . at the beginning you state in your last letter that i will have the chance to do two activities . i would prefer basketball and swimming . when i was younger i attend i local basketball team and we became local champions , so i am good at basketball and have a lot of experience . i am also good at swimming . last year i entered a swimming championship and won the silver medal .

as you know , i helped out at a pop concert last month , and i must say it was fantastic . let's start from the beginning . 
first of all , i had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars . i had to iron them , put them in order , so that the pop stars , who will sing at the concert , look impressive . and handsome . the most exciting things happened later . i saw all the pop stars , talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful .

as you asked me , i am writing to you about my experience at the pop concert . 
well , on the whole , it was pretty cool . there was no big stress about it . the only thing i was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management , when the guy there had to do something else . oh yes , i also had to check the tickets for five minutes . the woman had to deliver something . the problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people . there were 963 persons in the " armaggedon " that night !

but , as i said , the whole thing was fun . you must show a great sence of responsibility . but , kim , can you see an other way to meet the " new bentley " for free , talk to them and even get paid ? that was my best day ever , the one i shared a meal with paul mcpartney . i'm sure you are jalous now . don't worry they still organise these " youth work " programs .

now i want to tell you about a pop concert as you have already knowen i helped my father to organize this concert . i was doing a lot of things like redecorating , drawing . sometimes i gave some advices about suits and dresses . often we looked repetitions and if something didn't like us we tried to correct it . the most enjoable thing was to smart people . we have a good and rich sponsor , that's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that part of cloth which we thought was more similar to their style . we always explained them and at the end they agreed with us . these days were so busy . but when we saw our show and heard how loud audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time . you should try it and feel . i'll be waiting for your answer .

being a woman , i naturally love shopping . it is a really great pleasure going in and out from different shops , try on a variety of clothes and shoes , and finally go back home with dozens of bags in your hands . 
being a woman , i naturally love shopping . it is a really great pleasure going in and out of different shops , trying on a variety of clothes and shoes , and finally going back home with dozens of bags in your hands . 
however , there are a few moments in which you cannot enjoy shopping . the first one is the christmas period . shops are incredibly crowded . you cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it or not in peace , because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn . in many cases , you do not even find the things you want , because shops run out of products very quickly . moreover , during this period , prices are usually much higher than in the other month's .

another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable , is when you go shopping with a man . for the majority of men , in fact , shopping is the most boring activity in the world . a man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes .

suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend , that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on , you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory .

there is as well the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds crambled in the small shops during the unique day-off you have to buy somthing you like . all this can easily leads to a nerve-collapse , particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay . if this wasn't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when despite having been stolen , having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and after having walked a few blocks you see the same item at half price in another shop .

otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable . you can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were looking for , perhaps because it is not your size or the colour that you like , or just nothing is suitable to you . another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms waiting stand up for your turn . after that , the unfriendly and sometime's unpolite shop assistance who breaks your nerves down . but never mind ! the worst arrive when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit because your feet are killing you and realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight .

i'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best activity . but i have a particular problem . i'm not slim and i'm a little ashamed of my body . that's why shopping is not an easy thing to do . in fact i can't buy whatever i like and i can't follow fashions just like the other women do . when i go shopping i always have to ask for the extra-large size and harder to find it .

first , i don't think we can shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks , because these two elements are representative of the daily life at school , aren't they ?

first , we should film some lessons because everybody knows ( or remembers if they are grown-ups ) that this is the activity that is takes up most of a student's time at school . 
just after , to make a contrast , we may film the break , because it's the other part of a daily school ! it's the place where you can meet your friends , where you can talk free , there are no teatchers , it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons . to come back to a strict ( a little beat less ) subject , i suggest that we film the sport lesson , doing that will allowed the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups .

first i want to thank you for all the congratulations , and i'll try to answer all your questions about for instance travel and accomodation . i have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in july because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in july ( because her small children are in summer school at this time . another question was about the accommodation . i have to tell you that i'd prefer tents . for me tents are a kind of back to basic living and i like this very much . in my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature .

today i have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe . last month i received a letter which told me that i've entered a competition . i was so happy and suprised that i first could not really believe it . but it was true . my price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert . the pop group which was going to act is called " metallica " and i like their music very much ( 'cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to . ) but now to the concert itself . it took place on the 10th of june in salzburg . i started at 8 pm but i had to be there at 11 am . first i had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm . after this i met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal . the front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal . i was so excited that i also was not able to eat anything . at 5 pm the band members disappeared again and i was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists . i had to show them the way to the interviewing room . it was a bit boring but more or less okay . at 7 p . m . the first group started . they were unknown and not very good but when i met them afterwards i recognised that they are very nice . at 8 pm metallica started and i have to tell you , they did a great performance . when i met them after the concert they asked me questions like did you like the performance ! or how do you think about the first group ? questions like you and i usually ask each other . you know what i mean , they were not conceited or something like this . they were like any other person and i have to admit that i like them very much . this was one of the best and most exciting days in my life .

in fact , shopping can have some disadvantages for different reasons:
firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size . secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money in few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes , which you don't really need .

in my opinion , i do agree with this expression . one of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping . i used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section . it is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but also decrease the money in my pocket . 
i do agree with this statement . one of the most unforgettable habits of city life is going out shopping . i used to hang around famous clothes shops looking at the new arrivals new-arrivals clothes section . it is not only good fun to see the new fashions and things but it also decreases the amount of money in my pocket . 
sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time . a group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever . it seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside . from my point of view , someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy .

keeping balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex .

although it is not always enjoyable , people are shopping more and more . it is very fashionable those times . they do not always buy lots of things , but i think most of them do . 
even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway . is it enjoyable to walk around shops , looking at nice stuff , without having enough money to spend on it ? is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time or when it is very hot in summer for instance ? 
even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping . is it enjoyable to walk around shops , looking at nice things , without having enough money to buy them ? is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush hour or when it is very hot , in summer for instance ? 
enjoying shopping isn't the reason for doing that . i think people either go shopping to change mind because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people , to feel they belong to a group of human being .

what obviously appears about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes . therefore , the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main times that make our life .

to my mind , the class attending a lesson must be shown at first . it evoques the reason of our presence here and it is a cliché ; that can not lack . a philosophy lesson seems quite appropriate in that the pupils take part in it .

next , students during the pause in the yard should be filmed . it would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with the classroom atmosphear but also show how they are as young people . students chatting , laughing , eating and even smoking must remain in the video .

furthermore two moments could have a role . first of all , the arrive of every students , namely the picture of the school without anybody at first , and then with the crowd of students increasing gradually is typical of its life . then , the opposite situation , that is to say the scene of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can make a parallel .

how are you ? i have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here . you should have been here , it was amazing . the concert began at 8:00 p . m but my friends and i had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage . we started by putting up the lights . we had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them . well , we also had to carry all the instruments up to the stage and believe me , that was the hardest bit of all . they were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus . after helping to do that and many other things , my friends and i watched the concert and before green day ( the group ) left , they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did , and shoke our hands . i'll never wash my hands again . well that's all the time i've got for you now . hope to hear from you soon .

it's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities . the ones i'm most keen on are tennis , in which i think i'm pretty good since i took some classes last year , and painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems . i think i'm not bad at painting either , at least everyone in my family likes my work , includying myself .

nevertheless , the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage , which is terribly crowded . you cannot make a step without " touching " the others . it gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days , when the temperature increases . in such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring . but the worst moment comes , if you cannot find the thing you were looking for , because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out .

dear kim , i want to tell you about my good experience i had last month . i'd enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it has been fabulous . at first , i'd helped them to carry the material and we had fixed everything in the good order . they were so many pieces that we had spent a whole day to prepare the scene . at the end , we have had a beer and we talked together . i was astonished to see so friendly and funny they were and we got good friends . during the show , i was behind them and i could see the spectators shouting and jumping with their and up . it was unbelievable to realize that i'd worked with stars and that they were my friends . it is difficult to explain what i'd particularly liked about my experience because the most memories are in my heart and i'd never thought that i could get on so well with a group of people which i'd known only for few days .

who does not like shopping ? perhaps it is just men or anybody who has a lack of time or if you are looking for something particular to buy and the shop has no variety . 
frankly , if i had a lot of money i would have spend my entire life to do shopping . although i am the one who loves shopping , i can not stand on the easters , the christmas and sundays , because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food , buy some presents etc . however , everyone prefers to do the same thing and the same time . it causes over crowded shops , high-pitch noise , lack of parking place and if you have to go shopping with a child , the whole matters just enough to drive you crazy . despite knowing the difficulty we do not resist to do shopping in those days . on the other hand , some companies offer special service such as sending your order with the post or on telephone . it could be the solution , avoid busy hours or days , do not bring your child with you , choose the right shop which has park .

i think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day , we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm .

only who gets good marks can take part in theese activities , so sport activities are seen as a prize , so while the students are playing basket ball , tennis , volleyball . . . or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces , and our volleyball team is excellent . it would be nice to film an ancient greek poetry lesson because ancient greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading saffo , alceo , alcmone . . . .

thank you for your letter . i'm glad to hear that you have found a job . i want to apologize for writing so late , but i had a lot of work to do . 
do you remember the concert i helped at . it was absolutely amazing . my job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans . we started at 7 am . to let them in the concert area . i had to tear off a part of every single ticket . this part had to be saved for later because the concert orginazer wanted to know the exactly number of visitors . after two hours of tearing tickets i changed my place and went to help at the security section . here , i had to check the bags and couts of the girls . fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things with them , like knifes or scissors . so i looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags . i really felt like a security guard .

well , first , i would like to travel only in july , because it's my holiday here in portugal . and if it's possible i would like to go after the 10th , because i've got some things to do . 
and for me , i think tents would be better , i don't know why but , i feel more comfortable . i think it's because the last time i travelled ( with my friends ) , we stayed at log cabins , and when i was sleeping felt some thing moving in my skin , then i work up frightened and when i openned my eyes , i saw lots of big ants ! after that day , i've never stayed at a log cabin . yeah , i think that's why !

i was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop . ( i had to buy something for a friend , it was his birthday ) when i found a beautiful store , i stopped in front of it and start looking at the window ( outside ) , then i thought interesting and came in . suddenly , i saw a man with a cap covering his face . i tried to look again to see him better , because he seemed to be very handsome . and then he said " if you promise me you won't get out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that i'm here , i take this cap off of my face " . i didn't know what to do , i was sure he was a robber , or even a murther ! then i said " ok , i promise ! " ( frightened , of course ) . carefully , he took off the cap . tina , guess who was he ? ricky martin ! ! can you believe it ! and there's more ! he asked me if i could help at his concert here in são rafael . because the store manager told him that i was the best hairdresser in the city ! and his hairdresser was sick , so he and his producers were looking for one . isn't that amazing ? i met all the staff , and ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied record . tina , i'm the luckiest girl in the world , don't you think ? i'll send you some photos .

the book cry freedom by john briley is certainly one which will take its place in south african history . therefore , i think it is a time document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again , also by non-south africans .

generations of young south africans black , white or brown will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through . steve biko and donald woods will be remembered always . steve biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years . a peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime , dying such a violent death . donald wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the sa . police force . in the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment .

i would like to travel in july because my examination will be finished on june 15th . and i have a plan to go to visit my parents in bangkok , thailand , in the middle of august . so , i think july is the best time to go for the camp . in addition , the weather may be nice at that period of time . for accommodation , i would prefer tents because i get used to it . because i'm not good at sporting , so i will choose singing and photography as my activities . when i was studying in the university i joined the photo club where i got the knowledge a well as a wide variety of knowhow in taking photo . as i love singing and always spend my free time in karaoke to practise , i think my singing is not too bad .

" shopping is not always enjoyable " . i strongly agree with this sentence . i used to do shopping a lot when i was in the university . i was 19 years old but i spend over 200 pounds in some weeks just to make myself up-to-date all the time . i bought lots of new fashion clothes , bags and shoes . four years in the university i never had saving money .

now , i hate shopping because i spent a lot when i was young as mentioned so it came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste the time and money . i found that it's not worth when i went to the southern part of thailand 3 years ago where i met an old man and his little grandson . they are very poor . the money that i spent on shopping can help them a lot if i would not do it before . little grandson tried to help his grandfather who was 70 years old by hiring himself out as a gardener after school , though he was only 10 years old . this thing tell me shopping is not enjoyable any more .

if i had the choice , i would never go shopping in the big supermarkets . you can lose your way if you do not follow the signs , or you can't find the items that you want to buy . 
when i was at supermarket last week i suddenly decided not buying from a supermarket at all . first of all you need a lot of time , because the market is so big . secondly , you have a lot of choises and you do not know which one to buy . lastly , there is a recyling problem which many people do not care about . you buy a lot of items without thinking where should go so much rubbish . for instance , i think a lot about this issue , and sometimes i do not even want to spend water , although i should do it . i think i am too sensible .

life at school is made of several things . first , lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us . but there are also a lots of clubs and activities that take part in the daily life of pupils . that's why they both have to be taken in account in the video we will make .

the most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which we can do something real , concrete . for example , the lessons of mechanics or physics are very interesting . and especially the practical work . it would be great if we show it in our film , it might be also very interesting to watch it .

for other activities , we could probably show a training one of our sport team . for example the team basketball which has won the student regional tittle ( we can also say it ) or the team of football . after all , it is not important the one we will show . but i think we must give a good picture of the school with sport .

generally women like shopping . they like looking for fashionable clothes , bags , shoes and so on . in the bargain season , all shops are full of people who keen on finding stuffs which are good value for money . you can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes . the most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping . they don't fancy going into the crowdy shop . it is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting .

like most of the girls , i enjoy shopping but it can be either a great event or a nightmare . 
what you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is wandering around and looking at everything . having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment . 
what you expect when you go shopping , generally with a friend or two , is to wander around and to look at everything . having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it into an enjoyable experience . 
the nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive . then , you decide to wait for the savings but it is even worse as everybody want to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items .

first of all , the efficiency of the society has been improved . when shopping , we don't need to wait the kasse to take every article's note by hand . when booking a airline , we can just simply make a phone to any agency , and get it done in one minute . secondly , instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need , we can very easily search it from internet or on the local network . it's a very often heard , that someone , who has a special illness , gets operations by a foreign institutes , which he find via internet . moreover , with computer network , it can be possible that people work from home , making projects , controling operations or having conferences . lastly the way of communications has been also changed . instead of the tranditional telecommunication , we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of computer network .

cars , boats , motorbikes , airplanes: who has never used them once ? this is a good question . the people people seem always always seem to be running and the fastest of these inventions is certainly the airplane . 
at first , when santos dummont invented the airplane , he probably didn't think how the people could transform his creation . in this world , where the nations fight to be the better one couldn't be diferent : the airplane became the most important thing in the war . unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .

however , the invention of the airplane has brought us some facilities . how could a person come from brazil to australia ? maybe by boat , but it could take too long ! the best way is definetely , by air . after this invention travel around the world is so much easier . now , we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us .

your group has been booked into palace hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college . the college will arrange a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45 , so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15 . the reason we don't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students .

to my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car . cars take a big part in our life . everywhere you look you can see cars . more and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport . cars are also more reliable than other types of transport . you don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .

cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill . could you imagine if our police , doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot ? i don't think i need to comment on this .

from my personal experience i realised how it's important to drive a car when i was living in johanesburg in south africa . i arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and i couldn't drive at that time . johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live . i couldn't just go for a walk , it was too dangerous . there was no public transport and i had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else . there i soon realised that i had to learn how to drive if i wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .

the car has largely affected my own life . i can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than use public transports . i can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to thai music which i brought some cassets with me from thailand . i took a car driving theory test last october and i passed it and i will take a pratice driving test very soon . i think i have to drive the car myself , so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car .

i find television the most important invention . i think it's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema anymore . in one hand it 's because they have not enough money to pay it and in the other hand it's because they can't move very well for example if they are disabled . with television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .

these days , we've been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented . in our daily life , however , we seldom notice how much convinient life we've got , what is more , how much inconvinient our grandparents had got . how nasty we are ! let us try to appreciate thier importance again . 
these days , we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented . in our daily life , however , we seldom notice how convenient easy a life we've got or , what is more , how inconvenient difficult our grandparents found it . how nasty we are ! let us try to appreciate their importance again . 
as for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer . i have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times . when you take the class on computer programming , you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys . my professor said ' go and get familier with your computer , otherwise you'll fail' .

i find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione . that's the nature of human being . but , i think it's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate in our life .

firstly , the hotel in which the group is going to stay is 'palace hotel' . secondly , the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus . there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and no . 31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference . thirdly , the end-of-conference party would be a small disco , with a variety of drinks and food provided . therefore , you could wear something quite casual .

we are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light . with it , we read , study , walk , and so on . in the past people relied on the sunlight , moonlight and the light from fire . these were , however , very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out . they had to read , study and walk in the dark . today , this kind of thing hardly happens ! well , unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply .

i remember when i was about 5 , i visited a museum with my family . while i was in toilet , all the light was turned off ! i screamed and cried since i'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before . when the light was turned on again , i realised how important even a single light bulb would be , and i was sure i can never , ever live without it .

the invention of the car was a great point in history . from there on people got mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted . of course within the physical barriers . people now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their leassure time , to relax , or just to see something different than their home-countryside .

in my life the car has an enormous influence . i come from a rural area . the next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there . it has been quiet hard to me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city . i just had no possibility to meet them after school , because i had no vehicle to get there . i always needed my mom or my dad to take me where i wanted to go .

from my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented . some people use them in their work , others are wishing to get one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement . although is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us .

your group has been booked in palace hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in london . personally , i am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities . it is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference . in my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the picadelly line . however you would take bus number 150 , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .

inventions have affected all our lives ! 
inventions have affected all our lives ! 
the invention without no doubt , that has affected my own life by far is the car . cars have definitely changed all our lives , and i am not refering only in a positive way , but in a negative way as well . picture this: a big city such as london or new york with no cars on their streets . could you imagine it ? to be honest , i can't . cars are part of our daily lives . traffic jams make people nervous , sometimes really upset and violent . but , anyway , people use cars .

if we don't use them we suffer from them . in my case i use public transport during the week to go to work but i could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car . i really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle . isn't that contradictorious ? to go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh , non-polluted air , i use my car , which , as far as i am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all .

therefore i am thinking in selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places , and change my life for a new life: whithout car .

as is widely known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century , nevertheless i believe that the most important one is the computer . 
it is a fact , that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information . taking it into consideration i would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants , designers , engineers and so on and on . another point in favour is the possibility to connect to the internet . it allows you to have all the necessary information " on your fingertips " . also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world .

on the other hand there are some disadvantages . for instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create . another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .

we need light every day , not just at nighttime . we need lamplight in offices and schools and other places during the daytime . how wonderful life is since the invention of electric light . here we are just talking about the light we invented apart from natural light . 
when i was small , we lived in country yard , i remembered , we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time , it was very little light on , and many things we couldn't do under the oil lamps because the light range was very small . there was no any light outside our house , no light on the road or field either . i was always very scared whenever or wherever . because most places . covered by dark , dark and dark . this scaring dark is still affecting my life now . i never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family .

what a biggest person on the earth , who invented the light , einstein was . he created another day time after sunset , people use it to do anything they want to do , we believe we can't live without light today , specially in city life , we have a long time to spend for the activities after sun going to bed . which we definately need light to keep on . i dare to say , without light , our life will go into a dark , dark hell .

can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life ? such a simple and usuall things like a telefone , a car , a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us ( or we have got used ) as we use them every day . hundred years before people couldn't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer . they have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one beleives it is really so . 
can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life ? such simple and usual everyday things like a telephone , a car , a computer only seem to be normal and usual everyday for us as we use them every day . a hundred years ago people couldn't even use an electric lamp , to say nothing of a car or computer . these inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared , but not everyone believes it is really so . 
some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them . first of all they say about enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others . but to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then . i think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone doesn't matter wherever you are ( i am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice ) . computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems . an electric lamp was an important invention hundred years before ( but for that time it was like a revolution ) . i think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life . because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile transport is undenyable neccecerity in our life .

ceartainly it would be just like mine . because i live in a rural area far from any village , town , or city center . the nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot . i have no car , no local bus service to use . even comeing to basingstoke seems like a international journey to me . and ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life . but also i'm aware of that the time flies for me . i must do whatever i want befor it is too late . and i have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for the humanity .

it is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities . trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs . however , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high-school student .

it becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during the lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations . . . nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday's courses . bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student's phone , but his parents' !

can you imagine your life without any computers at all ? well , i am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a desert ! 
if you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives . for example , all infrastructures such as transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country , and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals . in other words , almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers . so i am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important .

from my personal experience , i can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool . it improves productivity of my homework , that is often essay writing , and also it allows me to access to the internet . since i live abroad , the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and to know what is going on in my home country .

i think the oven is one of the most important inventions . if there is someone who doesn't agree with me , he or she should try to live one month without using the oven . besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys . i'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes .

some inventions are not regarded as great things even though life without them cannot be imagined . people do not have the impression on important inventions any more , because they have been getting more popular and common . 
however , there is something which is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention . this is electricity invented by edison . from my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much phisical labour . what is more , many inventions have been accelerated by electricity .

the principal reason is the cheapest price . you pay only to frs for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want . on the other hand , if you are more than 10 people , you can have a group price and pay only 6 frs per person . it seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum .

first of all , you musn't panic . it's not serious enough problem to get upset . you must be very happy because you have been offed two jobs . in my opinion as you're really very keen on history , i think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum . now i don't know if it is tiring but i suppose it will be less tiring than a place in a restaurant .

if i were in your shoes , i would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same , i think that this choice is the best for you . but you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you . you'd better not to travel far away from your home . also working in a museum include big tips from the tourists . apart from these , despite the fact that it is a summer job you could be employed for the whole next year , if you are lucky .

i was very pleased to receive your letter . you asked if there are some school rules in my country . 
as you know , i'm studying at the private academy , so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes . i'll give you an example . in our acadamy we are not allowed to smoke . the fine for smoking on the academy is territory is 100 dollars . so nobody smokes there . i don't smoke , so i don't care about this rule . but some of my friends really would like to change it . you also wanted to know about what i'm allowed or not allowed to do at home . well , i have rather modern parents , so they don't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends . the only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day .

i am writing to you with regard to the international art festival that was held recently . 
the festival was excenent in many ways , and especially it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea . i assume that this fact attracted people very much . in addition to that , organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good . i personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with proper price to come to the festival . moreover , most of the events i went to were fantastic . 
the festival was excellent in many ways , and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea . i assume that this fact attracted people very much . in addition to that , organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good . i personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets at the normal price to come to the festival . moreover , most of the events i went to were fantastic . 
however , i still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year . the festival was supposed to be an international one , but the artists and stars participated in it were from six countries only . thus , i recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited . also , some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences . i think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls . furthermore , i found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays . so i suggest you have various kinds , and more numbers of plays and films next year .

people all have different opinions about books . some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones . but i prefer realistic stories such as ernest hemingway's " the old man and the sea' . 
people all have different opinions about books . some prefer realistic stories whereas others prefer unusual ones . but i prefer realistic stories such as ernest hemingway's " the old man and the sea' . 
above all , realistic stories teach me something of the life , or at least influence me . as far as i'm concerned , my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book . here , the fishman is very old , but he is still challenging to everything he faces . when he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship , he never gave up taking it back to his village , even when sharks were around him . real stories have huge impacts on me , and affect me a lot , often in good ways .

in addition to that , realistic stories are more attractive , i personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as i know they cannot be true . but , while reading realistic stories , i just fall deep into the story , into the writer's own world . ernest hemingway's sentences are precise , but still very powerful and alive . so when i read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , i got very angry and annoyed . realistic stories thus , develop our imagination and creativity , which are essential in our lives .

first , it was an international festival , it was a great idea , but only six countries were here . so , if you can have more than six countries , it could be great . this idea is in relation with the number of plays and films . if there are more stars and artists from around the world , there are more plays and films and it is better .

firstly in the school it is not permitted to smoking in the no smoking area or in the classroom . but , i think it is the same in england . secondly , when you want to ask a question to the teatcher , you must to put your hand up , and speak when the teacher ask you .

in my home , the only things i am not allowed to do are things which can disturbe my familly . for example , put the music too hight when my syster is working . but there are also some life's rules , like do not put legs on the table when we are eating or eat with my fingers . 
in my home , the only things i am not allowed to do are things which might disturb my family . for example , putting the music on too high loud when my sister is working . but there are also some general rules , like do not put your feet on the table when we are eating or do not eat with your fingers . 
there are not really anything that i could like to change , because , as you know , in france , there are not really strict rules like in china or other countries . it is just polite 's rules . i hope i answered to your question .

to begin with , i'd like to show you how are my obligations at school . although we have to change our boots , we don't need to wear special uniforms . our clothes should be in a good taste . we are also allowed to have jewellery and a make-up , what's especially crucial for girls .

when it goes to my home , i think i have usual duties i have to clean my room , wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets , but they're not exhausting things , as i share them with my sister and brother . however my parents aren't demanding , i have to be home at least at 11 o'clock and tell them where i go out .

on the other hand , i would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made . firstly , you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform . actually , they came from only six countries . what is more , some concert halls were too small . as a result , it was impossible for al the audience to fit in there .

well , here are some of my opinions and suggestions . first of all , i think there should be more stars and artists from more countries because this year , i believe there were artists from only six countries which , in my opinion , is not quite from all over the world . 
the jazz , rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls to small for the audience: i'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year . by the way , i was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent .

in our school , you're not allowed to eat during class . you must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom . my school's an american school so you're not supposed to talk in spanish during the classes either .

we are not allowed to talk during the lesson and we have to do our homework every day . usually we don't have to wear school uniforms , but there are schools , in which there is such obligation . in most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty . if i could change anything , i would probably lessen the amount of homework . it's hard to find any spare time sometimes !

the second point i would like to make is about the concerts which showed people jazz , rock and classic , which were fantastic . however , there were some concert halls were too small . quite few seats were available for audience , so a few people had to stand and watch concerts . i see you might not have had much time to be well-organised .

nowadays while my country is developing , most people are very busy , so they can't bring up their children . i think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing . for example , if students behave wrongly at school , they will have some punishments even up to now . what else , unless they pass the exam they have to get extra lesson or test . but most teachers consult with their parents , so it they behave wrongly it is true teachers call their parents .

in my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools . for example , we have to wear in appropriate way , not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers . at this time , in my school there is a new rule . we aren't allowed to use the mobile phone in class . before this rule it was funny ( new sound in class , phones ring or sing . ) , but not for our headmaster .

it was great idea for doing something like that . there were jazz , rock and classical concerts , but some concerts hall were too small for all people , who took a part at that festival . there were also plays and films , dance shows , which i liked the most , art exhibitions and talks by writers , but it would be good to see more plays and films next year . also a great idea was , that it was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events .

i'm writing to express my feeling and opinion about the international arts festival which was held a few days ago . 
when i found the advertisement of international arts festival , i was very excited . it is great to hold an annual international arts festival in the place . then i spent two days at the festival . i enjoyed it very much . there were so many exciting things i saw , such as stars and artists from around the world . jazz , rock and classical concerts , plays and dance show etc . the specified thing is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events , it is excellent because most tourist could offer what they like .

although how i enjoyed it , there were still something needed to be improved . for example , there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people , the stars and artists were just from six countries , which is not enough for audience . in the addition when you organize the next year's international arts festival , could you arrange more plays and films .

you mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter . this remind me of what i experienced during my teeenage . in my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at the first year of teenage . your know , this age is the trouble age , boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone . these always annoy the school teacher and parents . in a result of these the teachers make very strict rules at school , such as students aren't allowed to speak each other in the class . they had to finish homework in a limited time . they cannot oppose to the teacher , girls are not allowed to make up and wear any accessories . at home , in my experience , my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much amsh homework to do , even in the holiday . they also forbidden me to make a boyfriend . i think it is not just what happened in my home many of my friend had the same experience .

now i'm a mother of two children . they are all in the school . comparing to my experience , i want to give them more open attitude about everything . i want to be a mother of them and a friend of them . but at school , although i hope the teacher don't give students so much homework , don't forbidden the opposite voice of the students , there are nothing i can do because of our culture . it's quite sad .

actually not all the schools in turkey are so strict but unfortunatly the school that i'm going is like a military camp . the uniform , we are wearing has to be perfect . no one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules . the general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict however there are a few things that need to be changed . for example if you don't come to school 10 days in a year we fail that year .

thank god it isn't so strict at home . my family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course , which i don't do anyway . i am allowed to stay up late , i'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that . however there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do . they hate it when i listen to music loudly . i think they don't like the music i listen to .

although i am keen on classical music , i found some concerts halled too small . i was wondering if you could improve that ? also , there were interesting films but not enough . perhaps , you could possibly meet some producers , who come from others countries in order to show different cultures .

here in brazil the rules at school depends on the school . in general , the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools . in mine , we didn't have many rules . for example , nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom . we were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class . but we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .

the rules at home are very different . i am allowed to do what i want as long as i studie enough to aprove . i think that my parents let me do what i want , because they trust me . they know that if i go out with the car , i will not drink . it is not allways easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .

the idea of making the festival " international " was very good . i could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries , but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries . the jazz , classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were too small . plays and films i watched were also excellent , but more could be on the stage next year . i joined the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures . the dance shows made sight for our sour eyes , they were really fascinating . i learned so many things about the writers and their ideas , their life styles by talking to them . beyond all these , the application of joining all activities by one nice-priced nice priced ticket was excellent ; because it saved you from buying one ticket for each activity . next year , i think you should increase the number of shows , concerts and others , also the time spent at the festival ( for example: at least 5 days ) , then everything would be perfect .

the things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and i understood that some really don't make any sense ! the more you obey the rules , the better person you are ! our school is really very diciplined , especially about our clothes and behaviours . i understand the second part , but i can't get the reason of wearing in white an dark blue only . do we become the " perfect one " then ? then again , we have to obey all these rules . it can be said that i'm much more free at home . i'm allowed to do whatever i want at my room . i can't go out at nights easily , but that is not something that i mind about . there are three main things that are very important for my family: respect , honesty and trust . i think i show these three to them .

most common way to earn is baby-sitting . many young people earn their pocket money so , helping neighbouring parents to have a bit more spare time . other students work as house or office managers , make promontion of different goods or even as a bouncer . naturally , it's easier to get a job then you were good in foreign languagers or computers . when you can find yourself as a tourist guide or as a secretary .

firstly , there were stars and artists only from six countries . this number may be increased to attract more and different people . also some concerts holls were too small for this much people . in contrast with the halls , the concerts were great and i saw everybody enjoyed then . i must admit that you are very successful about finding good stars .

the films and plays were not so many . as a result of this the kinds of films were not enough . in order to attract more people with different interests , the films and plays should be increased . i have nothing to say with the dance show , art exhibitions and talks by writers . they were excellent and they attracted any kind of people .

another paht is the tickets . the weekend ticket is excellent because it is not so expensive and it allows to see everything . but i was disappointed that there were no competition between the films performed i think there should be an oscar-like competition in order to make people more ambitious to make better films .

i'm writing to you in order to express my feelings about the international arts festival . i spent two days there , and i think it was the best arts festival i have ever been at . i also hope , that the festival could be even better next year . the great idea of making it " international " was unfortunately not brought to life , because the artists ( mentioned to be " from around the world " ) were from only six countries . maybe the eason for that is very simple: lack of money ? it would explain , why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones .

we do not have many school rules , and the teachers are rather liberal . we don't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school . some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time , and we must not disturb others during the classes . we are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course ! in winters we are to change our shoes . it may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school's floors is not a nice sight , so we change our schoes without questioning that rule . i am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often .

first of all , as i see it the idea of an arts festival is great because in this way many people can know artists who cames from different countries . unfortunately , in the last edition there were artists who cames from only six countries , so i think you should invite artists from other countries , for example from africa .

in my opinion , one of the best things of the last festival was that there were not only concerts . i saw films and i played ping-pong . in the next edition will be more or less ? i hope more . the thing that i liked much more than others , was that i had to buy only one ticket for all events , and it was no pricey .

firstly , in our classroom you can't shout , you must be quite and sat . you must pay attention always because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question . in exams , you can't talk to the teacher , either you mustn't eat chuingham or take a walkman with you . in my home i can avoid that rules . my mum only doesn't want me to arrive late . however , i can go dancing whenever i want but telling her previously . my mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much i love her because most of the day i'm outside , but that's the true . my father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says .

nowadays everybody wants to earn money . young people know that money make the world go round , so they always look for a job with big salary . some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own , but i am sure that it's better to work in your free-time than waste it . in my opinion the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money . there are a lot of possibilities to earn some money but of course the young are not able to get well-paid job , because they are not enough experienced and educated . they have to think about some season jobs . firstly , the good way to earn money is , to help the old . they often are not able to do shopping or walk the dog . if you help them , they may give you some money as a reward . secondly , you can find an easy job in a shopping centre . it's better paid and permanent job . you can work in storage , look after the goods or catch shoplifters . if you are good mathematic you can be a seller .

first of all , i must congratulate the people responsible of this good idea . it is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city . and what a belter thing to solve this than to give the festival an international character .

but including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough , in my opinion . i think next year you should invite more different countries , because the festival would be more multicultural .

secondly , there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small . another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays . in addition , i would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket , due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use .

one possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best , and , then , " sell " it to the people . for example , you can dance folk be hamlet in the street , or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you country . you must be aware , anyway , of the difficulty of this kind of things ( bad weather , no attention from the people and so on )

i'm glad to have received your letter and i'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here . 
firstly , the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time . this is especially bad for us girls , as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys . but apart from this , i think most rules of the school are quite reasonable , like addressing to the teacher using the second plural person ( it is different in turkish ) or standing up when s/he enters the class . as we are a developing country , teachers are quite respected .

let me talk about the rules at home . we like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes , threatening to cut off the wires otherwise . also , as most of us live in flats , we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house ! but we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p . m .

overall , however , the festival was definitely a great success . i liked plays and films , and want to see more next year . the special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy arts without worrying about money . so all you need to improve is to have larger concert halls . i also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is being held using more notice boards .

i would like to recommend the job of home tutor . it is a job where you become a teacher and visit your student at his or her house . 
the best advantage of this job is the payment . it is very good considering how less time we spend on it . it's about 3 , 000 yen per hour in my district . it is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies . students who want home teachers are usually primary school , junior high school , or senior high school students , and it means they take lessons after school , not in a daytime . so , in a daytime , we can focus in our studyings .

another thing , plays and films . i saw only 2 plays and 3 films . for me it is too little . one of the reasons that i have visited your art festival was to saw a lot of plays in future i supposed to be an actress and that's way i want to learn something from professionalists . i hoe that next year i will .

the last thing is that i was very surprised when i read that you have weekend-price weekend price . this is excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival . now they can visit it by whole family at the weekend and see all events in reasonaby-price

i've already been to the festival and i think it's really important to let people see artists from all over the world . it would be wonderful if there were stars from more than six countries next year , the festival would be even more interesting then .

i also think the places you have chosen for the classical concerts were not good sometimes , some of the halls seemed to be too small . but your idea about the weekend ticket is just excellent , people from the whole country get the opportunity to visit your festival and see all the events you are offering .

i've got just one more suggestion for next year's festival . you could probably show a little bit more films and interviews with the most interesting artists . i'm sure it would attract lots of young people .

thank you so much for your lovely letter , it's always great to get something from you . howe are things going over there ? it's quite difficult to talk bout our school rules actually , but i'll try to help you somehow . hope it will be interesting for you . bu the way , are you allowed to smoke in the school ? our teaches don't let us smoke of course , but you can always see some students smoking outside , so it's not that strict to be honest . we're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teaches .

as you know , i finished school two years ago . this year , i started a private school in dijon . so the rules are clear , you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of june 2000 . in our class , we don't have problem with students who dislike to work , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there years and years . it is also expensive and i can't afford to stay there too long .

in my sweet home , my parents let me do what i want , because i am an adult now . but when we are in society , we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons . it is the same in our family and for example my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house or that i let dust everywhere . when i go out , they don't give me an hour to be at home , because i don't exagerate .

firstly , according to your advertisement , the 'stars and artists from around the world' came from only six countries . i felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that " our " world is full of different cultures . maybe not enough were represented .

thanks very much for your letter . as you asked me in it , here are some of the school and home rules in my country , france .

first of all , and i think it's very different in england , children don't wear uniforms at school . i was very surprised when i saw them in your country . it was a bit funny for me . 
of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself , be polite with the teacher and the other school children . during the break too , usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you . i think nowadays , children are more free and heard , i mean the contact between them and adults . usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it , the teacher not only punishes them ( not always ) but also speaks with them .

at home is different , each family has its own rules . as i am concerned , when i was a child , i was not allowed to stay very late with my parents and sometimes i wanted to because i was not tired . but i was a wise child , so ! usually , at home , like at school , you have to behave yourself but differently , because you're at home so you feel more confident . there are some rules like " don't speak with a full mouth " ; " don't put your finger in your noise " ; " say please and thank you " ; " don't fight with your brother " ; and so on , but i think it's the same everywhere .

i think there are some possibilities for earning money . i would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils , for example , maths or english . there are also some schools which offer such a job . to teach pupils is not easy , of course . but i think that after some lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff . so it would be easier for the teacher ! it is also not a dirty work , i mean you do not have to clean rooms or toilets of other people ! and you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers if you are working in a shop . to be a good teacher you especially need patient and good nerves ! not everybody has the ability to understand everything at once . and the money you get is not less

i see your advertisement about internal arts festival now . i think that's a great idea . as we need some good activities . advertisement is written that you invite stars and artist from around the world . this is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote you wrote from only six countries . i think you should invite from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world . if you invite from more countries to stars and artist , your festival will be unbelieved . second point is there are some jazz , rock and classical concerts . it's a good idea but some concert halls are too small . because of these , people are bored quickly . you show plays and films . i congradulate you because it's perfect . the most important thing is dance shows .

as more people like dance shows , me too . that's the real knowledge for us , art exhibition and talks by writers . i think we know a writer life or how is he writing it ? it's very significant thing . lastly , you said 'one reasonable-priced weekend ticket for all events' . it's excellent . if you can pay attention to my small suggestion , next year i hope it will be unbelievable festival .

i was very surprised when i knew that stars and artists were only from six countries . it was too little for this festival . it was pitty that too small halls were used for classical concerts . i like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sounds of music were terrible .

i have some suggestion for next year's festival . firstly , it will be great if you invite more famous singers and bands . the second one is to include more musical films and plays . i would like to help you in your interesting job . i look forward to your answer .

i want you to know how extraordinary moments i passed with my friends in the festival . your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable -priced ticket we paid for all the weekend . the festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows . on my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small , you've to consider make a big one for the next year because these kind of events are concurred by a lot of young people . in conclusion , i wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend .

in my house rules practically don't exist because i have 18 years old now so my parents only wish is that i study a carrear and be a good man . they only want to know where i am and when i go out at what time i came home . at school is complete different because the teachers don't foregive you nothing . you have to be quiet an attention in class if you wouldn't to be punished . i'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things . i wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to make the right things .

i went to your annual international arts festival . i really enjoyed it , although i feel it could have been better . but firstly i want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival , people need this kind of events . secondly i would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it . as it was written in your advertisement , artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented , i was quite disappointed . however the concerts were great , but unfortunately , some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave inside .

one of the best is working in a big supermarket . some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring . furthermore departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work .

another solution could be working as a barman , the problem is that you go to bed very late , but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night . unfortunately it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .

if you are a really good student in one subject , you can provide private lessons which is one of the most prolific job but do it only if you like teaching . otherwise you should try to find another job .

it's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide . the night he came into this world , was one of grater even if for the habitants of the country or even of the town where he was born , it was a casual night . the sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up all the land . only the one who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was born . when the three men saw him they fell on their knees to worship him . the mother was pride because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins . this little man from israel died as the hero of all times . his message is still as impacting today and will always be even if this story happened a long time ago .

however , the festival could be even better next year . actually , there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival . besides , i was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more . unfortunately , i am afraid that some concert halls where jazz , rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones .

to start with i would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories , both realistic and unusual , they make us thoughtful and form our outlook , and they make us feel and think . 
as far as i am concerned , i enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite the fact what sort of book it is . stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and people around us . however , reading an unusual , sometimes fantastic story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view . i consider " wuthering heights " by emily brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of everyday's routine . it is a remarkable piece of literature , which portrays deep feelings of love and hate , depicts strong and unique characters , reveals eternal concerns with good and bad , life and death . this book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality . it contributes to the world treasurehouse of literature and arouses irresistable fascination .

i think international arts festival is a great idea . i spent two nice days watching its events . i was there with my boyfriend . we have similar interests but we have different opinions . for me - dances shows were absolutelly wonderful . i like dancing and i like watching dances shows . dancers worn nice clothes , the music was very good . unfortunately there were no spanish dancers . i prefere them to others . maybe next year ? you should invite artists from more countries . we also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small . during the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it needs more room . i like listening to the classical music in the big halls , too . my boyfriend was exciting about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers . he was happy because he was able to talk to them in person . we had no time to watch all plays and films . we chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably ticket for all evants because we could change our planes during the evant .

i'd like to write about rules in poland . they're horrible . there are many things we aren't allowed to do at school . at first - we have to be at time . our lessons start at 8 a . m and we aren't allowed to be late . we have to change our shoes . fortunately we don't have to wear the school uniforms . we can wear what we want . most of studenst wear jeans and sweaters . we have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it . our school-bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books , notebooks , atlases and dictionaries all day . it is what i'd like to change . i'd like to leave my books at school . at home we have to do our homework . there's always much to do so we have no free time at all . our parents want us to be clever . when we have good marks at school they let us to go out ( to the disco or cinema , but only on saturdays and we have to be back by ten ) . on sundays we have to go to bed early because on monday our school starts at 8 in the morning . we sometimes help in the house but it isn't neccessary . we aren't allowed to smoke and drink any alcohol .

the idea of " international art festival " was great . but i feel the word of " international " was not really suit ; because you just only got six countrie's stars and artists came . i think you should invite more than ten countries . the other problem was choosing space . like the hall of classical concert was too small and crowded . next year , you should calulate or examine how many people come before you choose a hall , which i feel very good was plays and films . it can show more for next year's festival . the dance shows as well . and the offer of " weedend ticket " was an excellent idea . because the price was cheaper than buy it sperate and more convience .

i am writing about international arts festival which i went to recently . i had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual . i think that international arts festival was absolutely fantastic and successful . i was also pleased with the weekend ticket because i tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that i had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price .

in spite of having a great time , there were some things i would like to give you my opinion about . firstly , there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world . secondly , some concerts took a place in really small halls . i suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year . therefore , there will be more people coming the concerts . finally , food shops should be added in this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractive enought to get audiences .

hello . how are you doing ? i've been also considering rules at home with my friends . isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules ? at home i'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes , which annoys me very much . i really want to change this . however , i can go out wheneve i want , even in the mid-night . i'm also allowed to come home anytime so that i can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home .

there is a lot of rules at my school . firstly , we're allowed to drive a car to school , which is quite unusual rule in japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home . i actually love this rule because i don't have to get up early if i have a car . secoundly , boys are not allowed to have long hire . they have to cut their hair once a month . girls can't make up on at school at all . i want to at least put lip coluor on . i wish i could change this rule .

to sum up , there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person , you will surely find a way to earn money even in arctic .

two sisters , alex and daniela were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do . that year , the winter in france was very cold . it was near christmas and the two girls hadn't found any present for their mother . offering christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and only four days left . alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present . daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather . anyway , alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister .

after forty minutes , the weather became very bad . it was such a pain to walk in the snow . however , alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold . in deep of herself , alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere , but she didn't want to admit it .

unfortuneatly , daniela fainted . she was so cold that she couldn't move her legs . alex began to cry and to pray and when daniela was about to die an angle appeared . he asked alex if it was more important to bring back a present at home or to save her sister . the answer was obvious and the angel saved daniela . . this story happend a long time ago .

however , you said " stars and artists from around the world " in the advertisement . but there were only six countries' candidates . it was exaggerated . besides , some concert halls were too small . jazz and classical concerts' halls were especially small . it caused a long queue and i had to waste my time . except these two things , it was quite good .

i'd like to tell you about my experiences . before that , you have to think about why you need to earn money and how you do that . it is really important because making money needs a proper purpose . 
firstly , i did newspaper delivery . i could make a bit of money , of course , it was far much than pocket money . nevertheless , i lost my concerntration to the study and i spent the money to entertainment . i earned easily and i couldn't control myself at that time . i was only 12 years old .

secondly , i made brochure for a company when i was in high school . i was studying computer at that time . also i was leader of the computer user circle in the school so i needed some money for managing the circle . for this reason , i took this kind of part-time job in the company . despite the fact that it was part-time job , i worked very hard because i liked computer works . i could earn money , also i got a career .

in conclusion , if you want to earn a bit of money , then you have to choose proper part-time job . because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge . you must consider the purpose too . if you haven't purpose , you would waste money easily and quickly .

i am writing to give suggestions regarding the international art festival , which i went to one week ago . it was really good , but i feel it could be better next year . 
firstly , i want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival , it is very interesting , especially for the young people . i went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time very much . it was said that stars and artists from around the world on the advertisement , but in fact they are from only six different countries , so i hope there will be artists from more different countries next year . although the jazz , rock and classical music was great , some concerts and halls are too small , could you consider making them bigger next year .

in your last letter you asked me something about our rules , both at home and at school in my country . i'd like to tell you that . in school , we have lots of rules , especially in the class and some of them are quite strange . for example , we can't go to the toliet during the lessons , we should go there in the brake . and we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom . if you fail three subjects in your exam , you will be kicked out of school . it's too strickt , i don't like it . if i can , i would like to change this , because i don't think everyone can success at once , we should give them second chance to try .

when i knew it was going to be an international festival , i got really excited because i would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world , but i felt rather disappointed when i found out that was not at all true . besides this , i think that some of the concert halls were too small that i felt very uncomfortable . however , the one-reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events was marvellous because i was able to attend as many concerts as i wished without spending much money .

i must say that our school rules are quite different than yours . first of all we have to stand up , when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons . if you missed a lesson , that could be a trouble for yourself . i think it depends on the school . privat schools have more relaxed atmosphere that the state school . they don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons .

hello , i spent two days at your annual international arts festival . i was very impressed and i wish you could make the festival better next year . 
i think international arts festival is a great idea , because you can see how other country's art is , but i think in this festival , there were too many country's people . you should pick only six countries , so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small that the people can't even dance in classical concerts .

dear tim , i'm glad to have your letter back soon . do you want to know about our country's rules ? i think your country and our country's rules are the same . first , in school , we are not allowed to run . this is very important , because many accidents happen because of running . when we need to go upstairs , you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs , you need to keep left as well . you have to do your homework and do your best what you're asked to do . you can't go to the toilet during the class , because you are interrupting the other student's study and there are more . . like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks . second , at home we all have different rules . some family have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday . i think the main rule is when you can play computer games , because they love computer games . tell me about english rules . i'm curious about it . your best wishes from

contrary there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones ones clothing . you should wear the same things every time , no changes and alternations are allowed . it makes us like robots and feel bad psychologically , because we want to be different and free in wearing . also the attendance rules put a strain on us . if we don't come to school for 10 days , then we can't pass the class . they don't care if we have problems , exams to study or if we are ill .

first of all , it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities . because most of them were from english speaking country this year . in addition , larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars . moreover , personally , i hope that the number of plays and films will increase . i think they are the nearest 'arts' in real life .

if you say that the wage is far from satisfaction , why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher . it's also really popular job among university students because of the good salaly . if you are interested in teaching and responsible enough , you'll probably become an excellent teacher .

firstly , the idea of holding this international arts festival is great . i made people enjoyed their weekend , relaxed themselves , also it brought the foreign culture to them , enlarged their kownlegth . in addition to it , one weekend ticket for all events was only £10 , this was excellent , it made people only spend pocket-money , and then they could watch all the events at the weeked , for them it is really economical to spent their weekend . so my friends told me that was his cheapest weekend .

moreover , the stars and artists were only from six countries , in my opinion , if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries , it will make the festival more exciting , more intesting , and from my point of view , some concert halls were too small , the people in there couldn't even go to the loo ! because it was too crowed . finally , the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed , as far as i'm concerned . if you can show more play and films it will achieve a good effect .

at my home , there are many rules , because i'm careless , so i amn't allowed to smoke at home as well : and i'm not allowed to use telephone , because last year i made £1000 bill for one month , my parents were very angry with it , so they told me i am not to use telephone any more , oh , how poor !

with regard to the annual international arts festival which took place on 21 and 22nd november 2000 , i spent a tremendous two days enjoying some features . then , i discovered some points and i am writing to give my suggestions and recommendations . 
firstly , the title 'international arts festival' is very suitable for the festival , because there were some variety of features in it . next , one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also fantastic idea , because everyone could enjoy everything by the ticket .

however , according to my notes , there are some doubt in the festival . while you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world , they were from only six countries in fact . the number of plays and films were also very few . in addition to that some concert halls were too small to enjoy the concerts .

on balance , i feel that this annual festival can be even better next year . therefore , i strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls . i also suggest that more plays and films should be taken place . i would be grateful to support you providing that you would like to make the festival more successful .

thanks for your letter . it was great to hear from you . i know you're well , but i've been very busy studying because i have to take an exam next month . so this is a quick note to tell you what you want to know , as you asked about school rules and house ones . 
at school , the most horrible one is school uniform . i really hate it , because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes , colourful shoes and colourful socks . we can't also turn our hair colour an have to keep hair length above eye blows . next , we're not allowed to get driver licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we've students . we're also not allowed to get part-time jobs . if possible , i want to change all of them .

however , at home i'm quite free . just i can't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and i'm not allowed to play computer games over two hours . these are not so strict that i can stand them . i don't think i want to change them .

i am writing to suggest some ideas for the international arts festival next year . i have just been there and thought of some improvements which could make the festival better . 
first of all , the festival was a great idea . there were a number of stars and artists from around the world , but from only six countries . secondly , they held some concerts , but some concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for the people . thirdly , it was nice to see several plays and films . we would be pleased if you could have more . fourthly , everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks . lastly , the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable . however , a ticket for each event is expensive . i suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event .

speaking of rules , most of them are annoying ! there're plenty of rules in my high school . for example , girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees . that's so stupid ! it doesn't bother studying , does it ? and also we're not allowed to bring any sweets . i know some rules are necessary to control the students . the school uniform is a good example . and the advantage of this is i don't need to think about what to put on every morning !

in my opinion some concert halls were too small . i could not listen to one of my favorite classic concert , " la moldava " by smetana . most of the plays and films were brilliant but i think that if there is money enough , it will be better to have the possibility to watch more movies .

in italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very stricht . nobody has to be late in the morning because it is important to respect class mades and teachers' effort of getting up early . nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson . i can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is a bad beheviour . there isn't a kind of punishment for people who do these things .

my parents are very good . the most important thing for my parents is that i don't tell them lays . it's important for them that i tell them where i'm going if i go out and what time i think of coming back home . i can do what i like doing but i have to study . this is the only condition to do what i prefer .

i went to the " international arts festival " on 21-22 november . the festival was generally good but i have some suggestions for next year's festival . 
firstly i want to congratualate you for the festival . it was a great idea . however there were things that i didn't like . you said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was only starts from six major countries . i suggest you to increase this number for the next year . by this way we can meet other stars and artists , see different cultures . another thing that i will point on is , the concert halls are too small . some people couldn't enter the hall and they missed the concerts . there were some plays and films . they were excellent so can you show more plays next year ? last thing that i will say is " one reasonably-priced weekend ticket " . it was very good idea . i hope you will make the same thing next year .

'what are you dong here , why aren't you at school ? ' she asked . paul was like paralyzed . he couldn't reply .

first of all on the advertisement for the show it says that the actor was going to be danny brook and instead of him was a totally unknown clown that had no idea of how to act , it was horribly disappointing ! 
first of all , in the advertisement for the show it said that the actor was going to be danny brook and instead of him there was a totally unknown clown that had no idea of how to act . it was horribly disappointing ! 
second i got to the theatre at 19 . 20 because in the advertisement it clearly appears that the show starts at 19 . 30 , and i got heavily mad when i look my watch and notice that i had been waiting for 40 ( forty ) minutes and the show didn't start yet . . . i mean i was amaizing !

then i read on the advertisement , discounts available , and i didn't got any discounts when i asked for them . 
then i read in the advertisement , " discounts available " , and i didn't get any discounts when i asked for them . 
after the show i got out the show room deeply disappointed and went to the restaurant to drink something to relax , and do you know what ? . . it was closed ! i couldn't belive it how this class of theatre can be so . . oh i'm geting mad again so i'am going to tell you the last thing , it was the horrible night i had ever got so i demend for my money back !

i think that modern technology has affected all the human beings . modern technology has affect me in several ways , i mean the more the technology modernizes ; more confortness comfortable we get . now with modern machines i can make a better use of my time , if i'am late to go to training and i hadn't it yet i just take my food and put it in the microwaveoven . another example is the computers , i think they are one of the most advanced machine in the world , you can live your entire life in a house without going out , by just using the internet , it has also helped me in my school homework , i mean it's incredible the time you waist by making thing without a computer . but i think also that with modern technology we get more comfortable so that makes me a pacive person and not so active , this can be bad to because if i get used to be confortable when i need to do hard works i won't be able to do them .

i wouldn't like to be unkind but i must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information . first of all , when i had bought the ticets it appeared that there is no discount available . secondly , i must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone didn't excuse . moreover i would like to ask why danny brook , which is my favourite actor , didn't play in the show . furthermore i would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed .

i thought that if i said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way . well , i forgot that it's just a boy ! i shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin . it was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us . yesterday i discovered that he told everything to marl and tony . i really regret that i was so foolish .

anyway we had a very disappointing evening . at first , we couldn't get any discount , although you mention it on your advertisment . and the only tickets left were at £20 . then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned . last but not least , danny brook was replaced by a different actor , whose name i probably forgot because of his poor performance . afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good price value but also for it's original decoration .

i was in london for a week's holiday and i decided to go to the theatre . i saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and i decided to buy a ticket . i am still a student and i saw in the advertisment that there were some discounts available . i asked for it but the answer i received was that there wasn't any kind of discount . i arrived at the theatre at 19 . 00 and i thought i'd have waited only thirty minutes . i waited more than one hour because the show started at 20 . 15 . but , at the moment , i thought that these things can happen . when the musical show started i had the third bad surprise . the male actor wasn't danny brook but an actor that i've never seen before . at the end of the show i was very hungry and so i had the brilliant to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but , of course , it was closed !

the first thing i do every day , when i get up , is to prepare fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine . then i go to work by motorbike . the first thing i do when i arrive in my office is to switch on my computer . during all the day i speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e-mail . sometime i stay alone all the day but i have contacts with many people .

when i have to book a holiday , to buy a book or to control my bank account use internet and i do all these things , and many others , without moving from my office . when i finish to work i come back home . if i haven't enough time to cook i prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven . if i'm too tired to go out with my friends i finish my day looking a programme on television . i know that it can appear a sad day but it's what a lot of people do every day in every part of the world .

to conclude , i think that technology has improved many aspects of our daily life . but it's also true that sometime we aren't able to make a step without it .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . over the last five years , she had caused many arguments because of unkept secrets , but she couldn't help speaking to everybody . this time , as katie , her cousin , had told her their friend bobby had stolen a great camera , but that this was confidential , pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep ? however , she was interested in it , and decided to lead her own enquiry about this case . bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story looked very strange . despite katie's warning , pat reached her purpose by questioning carefully her friends , and realized bobby had been forced to rob this camera unless he wanted to be hurt . pat knew there was no solving the problem without the adults' help . katie and bobby would be furious , but anyway . . . she convicted the two criminals , and had the calm gone back within the school . it was the first time she had saved someone telling a secret , and she realized she had made the good choice .

i recently was in london , staying in my sister's home , and i went to see " over the rainbow " . i had a lot of problems and i would like to tell you about them . 
early that day i went to buy the tickets and i decided to buy the expensive ones , like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people that worked at the british institute . i mentioned it , but they told me that promotion had ended a long time ago . why do you put on the paper then ? in the evening i got a flat tire , and because of this i got late to the show , when i got to my place , it was used ( it cost a lot ) and they took me to the cheapest seats , where i couldn't see a thing . after waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started , i waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared , but i find myself that the main one wasn't danny brook , it was an impostor .

there were couple of things i noted down during the show . one of the reasons that i chose to see this show was to see danny brook live . but there was a different actor instead of him . i am very disappointed . another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start . instead of starting at 19:30 pm , it started at 20:15 pm . i had a meeting straight after the show but i was late and made fool of my self by arriving late and all those people starring at me and whispering . then i found out that the discounts are not available but on the notice board , it said that they are available . after the show , i noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day .

e-mails are also one of my examples . when e-mails didn't exist , i was writing letters and it took longer to get to the person i am writing to but with e-mails , the person could receive my message within few seconds and you don't have to count in how many days he will receive it . so in my opinion , modern technology changed my daily routine quiet a lot .

we are both very keen on musical shows . we've already attended " cats " , the " phantom of the opera " , " les miserables " , " grease " , and so many others . when we saw your leaflet mentionned " london's newest and best musical show " , we were so enthusiastic and curious that we bought immediately the tickets . on the waiting evening , at the entrance stood people , who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available . one thing that you promised on your leaflet . we didn't have trouble to find our seats , but we found very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more that your famous actors weren't absolutely mr brook and mrs truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles . i can say now that " it wasn't my perfect evening out " and i request now some money back for all these disagreements .

please find enclosed my thinking about the fashion of the future . first of all , i think we should consider the manner actually how the people are dressing to see how it's going to be developped into the future . everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others . we all follow the new collection on the market . today it's wearing short-trousers and yesterday was wearing broken-jeans . what we wear is also influenced by models , medias , or new collection , which come from paris , london , or new york . these new clothes are often very expensive that's maybe not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market . in 100 years , it's possible that each people will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic , latex everything possible , in a way to create own clothes .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . what is more , every time i trusted her with my secrets , she always let me down . it was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away . to make matters worse , people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs , which made me feel embarrassed . the worst point was that she started to make up false stories about me , which soon spread all around the neighbourhood .

one of the best examples is the car: in a lot of cities around the world , cars can be seen in the streets all day long . during the last decade the number of people who has a particular car has increased very fast . on the other hand people who hasn't any cars , can also be helped by technology: they can use the public transport like the train or the bus , which is also a comfortable form of travelling . but if you want a fastest transport , the plane is the perfect one !

at home , for example , my waking up is no more a surrounding sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams , it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio program , set to start at seven o'clock . then , when i was younger i would have to put the milk on the fire and wait until it was warm enough to drink . nowadays , almost everybody have a microwaves oven , where you put your milk less than two minuts and it is ready to delight your mouth . another thing are the fifty-two steps which take me to the street . they have become as easy as calling the lift , without feeling tired or even breathless , when i was in a hurry .

what are going to look the clothes in a century from now ? are they going to be the same , are they going to have colours , are men going to wear long skirts and women boxershorts ? this is something that has trabled many people , especially those who work in the fashion industry . 
what are going to look clothes clothes going to look like a century from now ? are they going to be the same , are they going to be colourful , are men going to wear long skirts and women boxer shorts ? this is something that has troubled many people , especially those who work in the fashion industry . 
fashion has made a big progress since the ealary beggining of the world . the variety of new fabrics , colours and quality , make new fashions statements every day . although the clothes are getting more and more smaller . in the early 90s it was in fashing the women to wear only skirts . long ones actually and men to wear trousers . in the sixties people worn clothes with flowers , big glasses , jeans , and men should have had long painted hair . nowdays women were really short skirts , short t-shirts , short tops , and cut their hair short just like men . boys pearce their bodys just like girls do . and the other way around . if this continues the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts . clothes will get smaller ( ; practically people won't be wearing any clothes ) people will were extreme . clothes which will be really lanky . people will wear all those clothes that expensive designers designe but nowone wears them .

to make matters worse when we bought the tickets , they were too much expensive and there weren't any discounts for young people or for groups . but the worst happened when the show finished , because we ( my girlfriend and i ) were hungry and the theatre restaurant was closed .

dear sir: i am writing to you this letter because i would like you to know about a musical show which i went to see to the circle theatre . first of all , i wanted to see this musical 'over the rainbow' because the actor danny brook was acting in it . but when the musical started i got very disappointed because harry smythe , a not very famous actor , was acting instead of danny brook . then , the musical didn't start on time . it supposed to start at 19 . 30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour . all the people got very angry . also i bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15 , £20 tickets . i couldn't have my ticket discounted because when i went to buy it they told me that was untrue . furthermore , in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show , it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill . it was ridiculous ! in conclusion , i didn't have my perfect evening out , in other words , i had a very disappointing evening so i am asking you for my money back . i would like to have my money back in ten days , in the other case , i would have to sue you . i am looking forward to hearing from you . yours sincerely ,

on the other hand , despite the fact that you said that it was starring by danny brook and tina truelove , i must tell you that danny brook did not appear at all . instead of him there was another actor who neither act nor sing , and , even though , it was a musical show .

the last thing i would like to complain for is that the theatre restaurant was closed because , as it said , of " vacations " . if in the advertisements and leaflets says " visit our theatre restaurant after the show " there are not reasons for being closed . it should be opened at least until all people gets out of the place . it must be our decission whether to stay and eat there , or not .

in our grandparents' time life was so different that we cannot believe that this huge change to our daily life happened in only one hundred years or less . 
first , we have to admit that technology has really increased the access to communication , traveling and geting information . you can now know what happens on the other side of the world , at the same time it is happening . what is more , you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the " enter " key in a computer .

furthermore , as we all know , day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks ( as our grandparents used to do ) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler . strange as it seems , we now can have every machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable . things that human beings used to do , now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly .

one the other hand , despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life , the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people . as people do not get a job because is not needed they get into poorness , criminal activities , being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education . this is the most terribly disadvantage technology has .

with advantages and disadvantages , technology is in our life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others . things and technology changes every day our life , our jobs , our way of face the world , this is what differences both centuries , our grandparents' changes lasted to long to change human life .

dear sir , i would like to show you how disappointed i am about the musical show you manage . as i had a whole week holiday i decided to spend it in london . at first i though i would just make a bit of sight-seeking all around the city . but when one night i saw your advertisement i decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical show . no sooner had i seen the starring actor than i couldn't believe it . danny brook was one of my best friends while i was at university . but as the show began , i realised that the actor was someone different , his name was tim paradise . if this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened , but i had to wait stil quarter past eight in order to watch the show , instead of beggining at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . pat is my best friend . we spent all our childhood together usually driving our parents mad . as we grown up , we were getting closer and closer sharing all our love stories and even more . i'm certain , that our friendship is stronger than other people . but i do have a problem with her . pat isn't good at keeping secrets . even worth , she is not able to keep anything . for instance , i was organizing a party for my sister's birthday asking all . friends to close their mouths . all did except one: pat . last year , pat and i were driving back home and unfortunately driving too fast i drove through the front gate . i was wondering how to tell my parents and i asked pat if she could keep it secret till i found the way to tell them . of course , the following day all my family had heard about my odd story . in conclusion to this , why do i still go on with her , it's the fact i love her as well as my sister and i know that she can change it if she would because last week , she organized a huge party for me , without telling me .

first of all , we went to the theather to pick up our tickets . we were thinking to get some discount on our tickets , because we had already read from the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay complete money for the show . we were ready for the show at 19 . 30 . we sat out sits and waited for the show but it didn't come out on time , it started at 20 . 15 which was redicoulus time . we waited for 45 minutes .

for example , the advertisement said that danny brook would be the lead actor , but he was not . instead , there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and a terribly annoying voice . moreover , the play did not start at the time it was supposed to . i had to wait for forty five minutes . all the waiting made me quite hungry , so i was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show . however , it was closed for cleaning .

i am writing to share with you some feelings i have after watching a musical show which was put on at the circle theatre last week . unfortunately my feelings are rather bad . 
i had a week's holiday in london last week , when i saw your advertisement concerning 'over the rainbow' musical show . the advertisement looked pretty interesting and i dicided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show . especialy due to the fact that i wanted to see danny brook - my favourite actor . i was really disappointed when i saw a different actor . the 'theatre' even did not appologize for this range . to make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have been ( started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 ) . despite i am a student and the advertisement said that discounts were available , i was refused to buy a half-a-price ticket , and the explaination 'why' wasn't sufficiant . i tried to relax after the show , so i made my way to the theatre restaurant , which according to the advertisement ought to be open at that time . unfortunately it was not , which made me even angier . there was no information why it was closed and if it would be open at all .

watching the show plus the 45 minutes of delay made us hungry of course so we decided to eat at the theatre restaurant . as it was too late , the restaurant was closed and we starved till we got to our homes . we were also disappointed because there were no discounts !

however i think the style of fashion will not have big differences because i believe that fashion is in a circle . the mean of this is all our fashion styles come from history . for example our fashion style at the moment is comes from 70's fashion . we always repeat the fashion with adding some new fashion at that time .

i was very disappointed . in addition the concert didn't start on time . it was quarter of an hour late . if i knew that the show was going to be late , i would ask my mom to come with me , because her working hour ended at eight o'clock . the restaurant was closed after the show ended . on the other hand there were no discounts available , as a result i had to paid extra money for the tickets .

the story began in 1989 in new york . mallory and his partner , pat had planned the best plan in the world , which was to steal the diamond from the national bank . as a result the only way to get into the building was at the top of the build . their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building . the alarm was situated at the top . so they could take their time , rather than going in at the front door . as soon as mallory stole the diamond . he ran away . unfortunately the guard saw him . by the time he got out of the building , the cops was ever where but as long as mallory is alive , he won't be arrested , with his unpredicatable mind . he ran into the old build , and hidden a diamond in there . unfortunately the building was a police station .

i am writing to complain about your show " over the rainbow " and the conditions in which it is performed . 
i was having a week's holiday in london when i decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show . i had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me . moreover an english friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as danny brook was a very good actor .

so on saturday , june 7 , i was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining . firstly , there were no discounts available as stated in your advertisement , not even for students , and i had to pay for a full-price ticket . secondly , we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15 !

no need to say how much i was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of danny brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much . at the end of the show , i decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and i went there . . . just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted .

to sum up , it was not the " perfect evening out ! " you advertised . so i am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me . i hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in france ( see the letterhead ) .

firstly , it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor danny brook would play in the show . despite it , a different actor stared in the performance , which was really disappointing . secondly , the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be . thirdly , no discounts were made when i was buying the tickets . lastly , the theatre restaurant was closed after the show .

during the centuries man's clothes has been changing and even developing in some way . people wore clothes made from metal , which were rather heavy , i suppose . they wore enormous luxurious dresses , which , in my opinion , you can't feel very comfortable in . nowadays people wear more common clothes . i think we can make a conclusion: during the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common .

nowadays , modern technology is becoming absolutely essential to our daily life . it is another important factor which affects our life , apart from money , health , food and housing . 
the reasons it is important to us are , first of all , if you think bout life without computers , communication machines and transportation machines . we wouldn't be able to sort out informations and datas this quickly . secondly , no one could communicate on the phone through countries or even through houses as immediate as nowadays . lastly , it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travel by plane . without all this you life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago . put it in another words , modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every ways .

on the other hand , the affects that it has on our daily life is not always good as sometime , the technology went wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disaster accidents , for example: plane crashes , trains crashed and explosion of nuclears bomb . if this continue to happen our life would be very misarable as accident happens all the time . therefore , it is important to get it exactly right .

the things that really dissapointed me were that you said danny brook and tina truelove were suposed to be the actors but they weren't , different actors played and to be honest they made the hole show very bad . also the show was supposed to start at 19 . 30 but finally it started at 20 . 15 and that is such a waste of others people time . another thing was that you said discounts are available which is very important for students , but no their weren't any . also after the show your restaurant was closed because their wasn't enough staff .

when we think about clothes in the future , we should think about the enviroment first . what will it be like in 2100 ? it is not pleasant to say the earth is now facing some serious problems . but it is the fact . air-pollution might become more serious than now in the future and destruction of ozon-zone could not be stopped in 100 years .

considering these elements , we should wear clothes which can protect us from certain kind of sun rays and air pollution . i suppose they would be like a arm-suits . of course , technologies will have developped enough to invent new material for those kind of clothes . so we don't have to worry about how heavey they will be . we will feel as if we put on nothing .

among the greatest inventions of man i came accross dayly are telephone , computer and automobile . at any time of a day i may contact any person at any part of the world over phone . it takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend nigel living in australia - thousand kilometres' from me . computer , probably the must versatile invention , allows me to get an access to huge informatonal sources through the internet , to make shopping without leaving my house , to do my work more effectively and quickly . automobile saves my time when i'm travelling .

firstly , there was a different actor instead of the famous actor , danny brook . that made me so disappointed . secondly , i suppose the show will start at 19:30 , but it started t 20:15 . it caused me missed the train and i went back to the hotel nearly in the mid-night . another problem is , i realised that the discounts were available . however , there wasn't any discount . additionally , the advertisement said i can visit the threatre restaurant after the show . when i arrived , it was closed . that is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice .

i am writing to complain about the musical show " over the rainbow " which i saw on 15th of june in your theatre . 
firstly , i wanted to see dann block playing as your advertisement already said , but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening . in addition to this , the show did not start on time , 19:30 , so i had to wait for 45 minutes . another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20:15 .

as for the ticket price , you promised to provide discount tickets , but they were not available . furthermore , when i went to the restaurant after the show , i found it was closed . because its opening time was from 10:00 to 17:00 .

last week , i went to london to see the musical " over the rainbow " . i was really happy to be seeing the " best musical show " in london . but what i saw was exactly the opposite to what i expected . in other words , it was a disaster . 
maybe you could explain to me , what the problems were . by problems i mean , that the show started at 20 . 15 and not at 19:30 or why were no discounts avaivable ? but these are only little problems . the most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors which were not very good in acting . and after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening , because we actually wanted to go to the theatre restaurant after the show , but it was closed .

unfortunately , modern technology made the life for many people easier . if you think about the early days , when no cars were on the roads and noone had an opertunity to fly to another country for holiday , people had to walk or go by horse and ship . today , everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever they want to . modern technology also allows you to go into the internet to get any information you need . every production is much faster and cheaper than before , because you don't have to pay for worker anymore . every thing is controlled and produced by machines . this also is a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs . the only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore . another disadvantage is that every one becomes a bit more lonely because they wath tv or play or work with the computer and don't see each other any more because they don't have to . you never get bored .

one of the reason i went to see that particular show , was the starring actor announced in the add , danny brook , but when the show actually started , with forty five minutes delay , i realized that danny brook was not in the play . the add also mentioned discounts , but that wasn't true either . after the play , which turned out to be just as bad as i thought , i wanted to relax in the theatre restaurant , but it was closed , and for no reason !

we can hardly imagine life without compures , t . v . sets , microwaves , and so many other things , and yet , none of these things existed seventy years ago . i think that the life we live is easier than our parents , thanks to technology . we can do things our grandparents could only dream of . internet , i think , is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity . my life has not been affected or changed by technology , because when i was born , most of the things that i use in my daily life already existed . but technology is becoming more and more complicated , and new things are invented every day , so i think that our life will be completely different in forty years . and , since all these new things only make our life easier , technology is welcome .

as i thought your advertisement was interesting , i went there but it was not good as it should be . first of all , the actor was not danny brook as you wrote . secondly , it ought to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:30 . according to the advertisement , the discounts were available . in fact , i had to pay the full price which costed me £15 . after the show i intended to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because as you have known that the show started late , therefore the restaurant had closed before the show finished .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . the story begins when jan , who was pat's best friend , told pat that she saw tim when he was cheating the exam . the next day , pat told everybody what she had heard from jan , so when the news came to teachers' ears , the teachers decided to give tim grade f in that subject and tell his parents ! !

now , jan has still been bullied nearly everyday . her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help thier child and that is the reason why i'm writing this story . if all of us try to help her , i'm sure that we can make her a better school life .

first , i expected to see danny brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation . secondly , although the show started at 20:15 , your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and i was not able to eat dinner . i had planned to have dinner there after the show . what is worse , the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that i showed my student id . visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant time during my holiday in london . i do hope you will understand my feelings and send some money back .

on day we decided to write a special letter to pat; in the letter we told him that we felt in love , we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes ( as pat likes women ) . the only problem was that the girl was to shy to speak to him , she wanted to keep her name in secret , and if pat tells someone something about the letter , she won't say who is .

poor pat , he was so happy because a girl loves him and so nervous at the same time , even eating his nails . as i said at the beginning pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it . three days after we sent him another letter , and pat told us again but we said , " oh pat don't tell that lie again " , so pat got furious and showed us the letter . we laughed and explained him that we were who wrote that letters , and made him promises that when he gets a secret lover , a real one , don't tell anyone because he won't meet her .

it is certainly true that the modern technology has been changing our life a lot in these days . but how it affect to my daily life ? i get up in the morning with the soft sound of radio program not the sound of alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching tv news . in the bus or even in the tube , i can talk with a friend with a mobile phone when i feel boaring . sometimes i even do some games with it . in accordance with study or work , i use a internet , which is the easist way to get informations all around the world . furthermore , i can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time . without it , it would take more than one week . after comming home , i can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the hi-fi . in conclusion , modern technology affects a lot to my daily life as well as the whole society . and in my opinion the amount of it's affection to the human life would be more than this in the future .

unfortunatly , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . the poor boy was only 5 year old and at this age , it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret . so when he heard at random that my parents were planning to offer me a trip to san fansisco as present for my birthday , my little brother ran in my bedroom wherever i was studying and whispered in my ear the wonderful news . i knew they wanted to send me to america because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend fred , whom they didn't appreciate . but fred booked a place on a plane to san fransisco and that's why , even if i didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for america , i had been looking forward to going with fred for already one month .

hello . i'm robert and i'm writting for the article about clothes in the future . in my oppinion , in a hundred of years , we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays . what will change in clothes , will be the comfortability of them and the way they protect us and our body from temperature and physical agressions . i think they will cold us in the summer and makes us hot in the winter . clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free . wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater with a high pressure , and we'll have freedom of movement . technology will take part in clothes development , scientists will search the way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable , so i want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes . i wish i win the trip !

i arrived at the theatre at 19:30 , found my seat and waited for forty-five minutes , with two hundred other people , for the show to start . 
when it finally started i noticed that the famous actor danny brook was replaced by someone who was not as good as him . danny brook was the reason that most people came to see the show . after some time a few of them started to leave the theatre . i was a little more portient so i stayed to watch the hole show , which by the way was the worst i had ever seen . i don't know why i payed £20 with no discounts as the advertisements said it woul have . then i thougt that i should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that i couldn't say that i wasted my time by coming here . i became furious when i saw that it was closed because there weren't any employees to work .

the last ten year computers had entered almost every house , especially in rich countrys . competers entirely changed people lives . children can play games on it or watch a film . there are millions of things you can do with a computer . you can listen to music and generally use it for fun but the primary reason that computer were invented was for communication . there are hundrets of prograns which help you communicate with your cousin in australia or with a complete stranger which you wanna meet . millions of people use computers for this reason .

i have to admit that it was not as i expected; first of all , the main reason i went to see " over the rainbow " was its actor , danny brook . it was very disappointing when i realised he wasn't in the scene . beside this , i had to wait three quarters of hour before the show started . during this time , i decided to have a drink in the restaurant but , as well as being closed , there was no nobody from the staff that could help me . i couldn't believe it ! i would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre . furthermore , you talk about discounts in your leaflets and they were no available , so , it was an expensive evening !

first of all , in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available , but when we bought our tickets , one of the employees refused to give us ' tickets student price ' . despite being forced to buy adult tickets , we still were excited and took our seat , and waited for the beginning of the show . usually , the show starts at 19:30 , but this time we had to wait until 20:15 ! in addition to this , it was not the famous actors that you have mentionned in the advertisement , so we were disappointed .

and there would have been no problems if i hadn't talked to pat about that evening . it was only a dinner with a friend and in fact we'd spent all the time remembering our childhood , but probably pat can have thought that peter and i weren't only friends . so she ran to jon in order to make him know the terrible mistake i had made that evening . he became very angry no matter how hard i tried telling him the truth .

how much effort and time it took about two decades go to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges ! but today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat , and modern coffee machines can make even cappuccino or whatever you want on their own . those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use different kind of cooling and will tell you if your forgot to close the door ! the modern cooker will turn off itself if something goes wrong ! personally , my life became much faster and i have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to devices modern technology offers us .

the manager of the theatre dear sir , i am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the musical show " over the rainbow , " i attended to , a fortnight ago . to begin with , never have i been so upset when i realized that the expected famous actor danny brook , did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was , quite mediocre . your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracy ; this entertainment did not sart at 19 . 30 p . m but only at 20 . 15 . more over , i was looking forward to getting a reduction on the pricing as , indicated on your adverts , but i , once again , fell flat . indeed , it happened that this was not the case at all . additionally , i could not even enjoy having a drink , after the show , in the theatre restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation . " a perfect evening out " ! ? not at all . under these circumstances , as your theatre did not fullfil its commitments , i ask you for a full refund and i expect to receive a cheque of £15 , as soon as possible yours faithfully

three hundred years ago fashion changed up one time in each hundred years . one hundred years ago it was one time in 50-25 years . and now we have to change some of our clothes every 6 months because they are not so fashionable any more . fashion is one of the most important parts of our image and everyday life now . fashion is becoming more useful , all the new inventions and technologies are going to play an important part in the fashion industry of the future .

it is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what will clothes be like 100 years from now . with no doubt , the influence of modern technologies will be great . future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable , we can see the progress in the fashion even now . it seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year of 2050 .

first it helps my social life to be convinient . i have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often . second i can save time . if there was no public transport like underground in a big city i couldn't imagine travelling on time . 
first it helps to make my social life convenient . i have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often . second , i can save time . if there was no public transport like the underground in a big city i couldn't imagine travelling on time . 
on the other hand , modern technology could affect my life in a bad way . because of computeres or telephones i could have less chances to meet my friends than before . it could make my emotions fade . another problem is pollution . i think a car is one of the most common products of modern technology . the more cars there are on the street , the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit .

to sum it up , as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient . in spite of its good sides i think my life could get worse . to live in this world needs somebody else to contact and health . but i am loosing chances to meet my friend face to face and i feel i am getting weaker . i suppose people including me should keep themselves in a limited their own space in near future . it will be caused by technology .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . he had talked to caroline days before the secret was known . she had told him about the relationship with her boyfriend . everybody knew that caroline and her boyfriend john , loved each other so much that it wouldn't be rare to find that they had have sex together . the point here is , that caroline choosed the worst friend to told this . she was also concerned about being pregned , but she was afraid to told john about it . so she decided to ask pat what to do . when she finally told him , pat react in a very wrong way and told rapidly to john . he couldn't belived what pat had told him , so he broke pat's nose . pat's father had to pay a very expensive operation . but as every story this has a happy final . john and caroline still love each other , and she wasn't pregnant at all , it was just her fantasy . and pat understood that secrets should die on your own .

there are some differences between the advertisement and the real show . with the advertisement , you mentioned mr. danny brook and mr. tina truelove were going to play but actually different people were playing , whom i have never seen before . and also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it was not started until 20:15 . to make it worse , neither discounts or restraurants were available at that night although they were said to be available . according to the owener of the restaurant , it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off .

there have been already a variety of fashion style nowadays . some are in formal others are in casual . especially in big cities such as london , new york and tokyo , you can see a lot of people in various clothes , so i do not think there will be such big differences in outlooking of clothes even 100 years from now .

to my greatest disappointement danny brooks was not in the show , but his part was played by an actor whose ( lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement . after the show i had to find out that the theatre restaurant , that had been recommended to me , was closed because it had been booked by a private party . contrary to your advertisement i had no " perfect evening out " and i think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ i paid for my ticket .

the main problem was that danny brook did not take part in the show . however , i bought a £20 ticket mostly because i saw his name in the advertisement . furthermore , the show started only at 20:15 , although , it had to start at 19:30 . moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening , i think you should know that ticket were sold without any discounts .

for example , i live in kursk , and i can get a letter from my friend after some hours since he has written it . my friend lives in kresnodar . my grandmother lives in orel , which is much closer to kursk than kresnodar . and it takes 3 days to her letter to get to kursk . that is because my friend uses e-mail , but my grandmother uses post service . so with internet i can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time .

i'm writting you because i wanted to tell you what a bad experience i had during my holidays when i went to see the play on your theatre . to begin with , the actor you publised was going to perform , didn't . to make things even worse , the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late , at 20:15 , and there weren't even your famous discounts available .

as if that wasn't enough , after the show , i took the risk of going to your restaurant and it is not very hard to guess that i wasn't able to enjoy it , as it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to serve food ; the perfect ending to the perfect evening . 
considering all this , and especially the fact that i didn't get a discount on my ticket , i think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me , and so i can go an spend the money in a good play when they do what they've promised .

in my own personal experience , technology is something i can't live without . from a simple domestic appliance , a tv or a radio to a cell phone or a computer , my life is much better now than it was before . for example , whenever i go out by myself , my father gives me a cell phone , to call him in case i need anything . another thing i depend on is the computer . not only to play or use the internet , but also to write my papers for school .

unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . two days ago i thought i could trust pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret , our important secret . i wish i had never told her anything . 
unfortunately , pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets . two days ago i thought i could trust pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret , our important secret . i wish i had never told her anything . 
all began when , three days ago , i was doing homework in my class . i was alone because pat had to go with her parents to the cinema . suddenly , i heard step noises that were getting closer to me . it was paul , my teacher , who came to see what i was doing there . after a few words which i didn't pay attention to , my teacher went out the class . i was boried , so i decided to follow him to discover where he was going . he was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket . " see you tomorrow ! " i cried , but he didn't listen to me . then , while i was going back to my class i saw he hadn't switched off the light of his room . i went to switch it off . as soon as i entered that room i realised he had forgotten our exams there . i couldn't believe my eyes ! the exams we had to do next day were there . without thinking it twice , i took one of them and went quickly home . i had to phone pat to tell her which were the questions of the exam . when i told her this piece of news , she got surprised . we thought we shouldn't tell it anybody else . next day in the morning , before the exam , we were going to put the exam back with the other exams .

modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways . first with a lot of advanced techniques being put into practical use , our living condition becomes more and more convenient and comfortable . when we look around in the house , it is easy to find things like these : microwave oven , tv set , computer , etc . all these equippments are the applications of modern science . when you are planning to travel , you can choose train , car or even plane as your transportation . without the development of modern technology , it may take your several years to reach the destination .

fashion of the future . 
i think that in 100 years from now , the clothes fashion will be totaly different . in my apineon the world by it self will be different in temperature cased by global warming as well as people become more niceer , less will take place , so the clothes will mainly be maid from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray . it will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable . also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking clothes becaus by that time the population of animals will foll and green pease will very strong community , much stronger and pouful than it is now . so as we can think the future fashion can be pleasent or unpleasent for different people . the stile will be more or less simelar to each other and everyon will be setisfaid with its needs . 
i think that in 100 years from now , the clothes fashion will be totally different . in my opinion the world itself will be different in temperature caused by as a result of global warming , also people will become nicer , less this will take place , so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with smooth colours like dark green or grey . they will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable . also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will fall have fallen and green peace will be very strong , much stronger and more powerful than it is now . so we can imagine the future fashion might be pleasant or unpleasant for different people . the style styles will be more or less similar to the same as each other and everyone will be satisfied with them .

firstly i would like to talk about computers . a couple of years ago i bought a new computer and i had to learn all about them . even though it was my first one i managed and i got to know pretty fast the way they work . now , i'm just fascinated by internet and i spent at least half an hour every day surfing the net , visiting lots of webs and getting all kind of information for free .

i should not forget mobile phones . if i feel like talking to a friend i just have to call him and whereever he is i will be able to get through to him . several european companies like nokia or ericsson are focusing on mobiles and i have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile which is going to be great .
