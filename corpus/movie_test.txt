i 've never been in a place like this before .
i told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth . they let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors . that do n't cancel out the greatest crime in history . when that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families , tortured us , cut us off from our language , our religion , our history .
no bother . mother and father think i 've joined you . i might as well .

yes , washington sent me , richard . they sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked . do you know what i mean when i say this whole thing has been fucked , richard ?

christ !
i 'm picking up paul at the station - want to come ?
what 's your point ?
easy kid -- easy ... . come on -- i want to talk to you .
`` ... you look around , you say , 'this one has so-and-so , and i have nothing ... ''
a raptor claw . i use to have one . a fossil .
boys , this gets nobody nowhere - you 're over excited , steve and -
fine .
i 'll get to that in a minute . first , i plan to start our seasonal summer help early , and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea . i 'd like cooperation from local fishermen , and i 've also contacted the oceanographic institute over on the mainland .
thank you , miss -- ?
so what 's going on with the spring dance ? you have a date yet ?
carl ever say < u > he < /u > got one ?
i 'm fine . i just need to lie down ...

mikey look at this --

i see . i 'd better stick to running the paper , huh ?
oh right , last night . i guess i owe you an apology .
it 's just a party . daddy .
she was pregnant . did you know that ? do you know what that means in a place like this ?
look . i 'm serious . it 's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society ...
he would n't of took no beating like that if it had n't of jammed . he would n't just give it over an ' not shoot no one .

i --

and who says what is wrong .
ironic , is n't it ?
you come out here and talk to me , you fucker !
like where ?
hey , i hope you did n't take that stuff i said seriously . it was just part of the show ! it 's like the old days , when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd .
you 're right . easy come , easy go .
ja .
when did you start drinking again ?
well , well , well , talk to me , we sat down to eat dinner , and here i 'm a criminal ...
an ' you 're a weeper and a wailer always treading the toes of the great generally spreading your weight you 're a spiteful , hateful asinine creature a pupil with no scruples who knew better than the teacher
you 're just an experiment , freako !
okay -- book him and get him fixed up . looks like everybody 's goin ' nuts .

no bullshit .
i do n't know , mulder .
i 'd love to , but i really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and i 've been slacking .
it 's not . it 's fredereck fronkonsteen .
and i 'm asking you -
of people like you . people i was just trying to help . they could n't get worse so i thought , with medication , they might get ...
shut up , just put him on the phone , it does n't matter , just shut up --
yeah it is ... the best day before the weekend .
oh -- well , about a year ago -- i was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain ... .
but why single me out ? what am i in the great scheme of things ? you 'd think i stepped off flight 180 or something ... fucking weird , man .
sam , let 's go get married .

i do n't mean braze .
in position . jack open the door , let the package roll .
miss .
no ...
hey now ! no cussing on tv ! well in closing i 'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour . one is my perky co-anchor here , and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people -- people just like you and me !
hey !
our former commander was not ... strong .
i do n't know , why ?
all accidents until proven otherwise .
i do n't know ... what you 're ...
no -- not at the office . i 've got a better idea .
we share everything .
you 've what ?
a flicker of talent .
when i came upstairs , you stayed to finish your drink . i told you to turn off the tv when you were through . come to think of it , i also told you you could sleep in the maid 's room .
< u > this < /u > is what you wanted enhanced ?
i figured you share information .
i know that , i know that . jeez , you 're like a broken record . i 'm trying to help you .
we should take her to st. cloud 's . that much is obvious , is n't it ? let her make up her mind when she gets there ...
mister myers it is a chemical plant ! there are a number of volatile compounds -- but they are safely stored away ...
if you came back . if you survived at all . which it 's pretty certain you would n't .
you know what your problem is ?
come on .
why would sidney want to be with steve ? she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy .
i 'm sorry , but ... the stones ...
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .
did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair ? most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked ! ? you realize what would happen if this fort fell ? the whole hudson would be open to them !
there is an imperfection . for all your healing , if your head ever leaves your neck , you are dead . you can survive anything but steel against your threat . then it is over . the end .
hopefully no one .
you can both go take a flying jump .
what ?
there ! what 's so hard about that !
just trying to set the mood for the mission -- get the `` feeling . ''
do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now ? come on , it 's grad night . you 've got your whole life to be uptight .
i do n't think you 're gon na make it .
i got ta go make dinner .
she got me at a more impressionable age .
i hate asparagus .
i do n't know . maybe they 'll like it .
no , you 're not calm .
i believe the last time we came across one of these , was at the ballet . what were your words ... 'a fucking c.d . this case is closed . '
uh , fontella 's
every place has hookers , but if this hotel has hookers , they do n't look like they 're ...
gone fishing .
just tell me if anything weird happens .
look at my car ! piece of shit ! i just bought it brand new from a used-car lot , and the steering goes to the pot on me !
wednesday -- wednesday -- i got somebody penciled in -- let me see what i can do -- i 'll get back to you .
so was i .
fuck , go to the car ... call for backup . tell 'em officer down .
in time , you will drop dead , and i will come to your funeral in a red dress .
you 're hanging by a very thin thread , dude . and i dig that about you .
so -- which dakota you from ?
me ? i 'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman .
that 's out . no ! it 's too hot ! you think i 'm gon na let you get some , put on your clothes , then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when ?
you talk as if he were a gigolo梠r something .
it 'll warm you up .
well , nobody has to sell .
captain !
maybe luther hopes ganz 'll give him a piece of your money ...
t'aggia parla . [ italian-american slang for 'i 've got to talk to you ' ] nicky ... see that guy ?
you ca n't be hungry and scared at the same time .
sophie .
his name 's wally brown ... . great guy . been in the business since forever .
who 's that ?
honest to god , emmett , he would 've killed me .
yes .
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess . i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture .
hello , operator services .
wait , hold on , mary -- it 's not as bad as it sounds . i certainly did n't know --
i know , man .
that food has spoiled . that is why it was not shipped to the army .
-- never mind .
fuck her too .
or maybe you just think you do . just another small town . one guy chasing you . you go big town . just gon na have four guys after you instead . kiss kissy kiss . it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? cause you got ta remember you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , that 's where you gon na be .
that 's what i want you to do , you moron !
it 's not you , it 's me . i 'm completely fucked up .
`` yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil , '' but no one ever said i would n't be shittin ' in my pants every step of the way , huh ? stick out your tongue . that'a boy . now why do n't you just lie down and relax .
you going to tell him ?
for pete 's sake , norville !
let 's just keep walking .
welcome , podner . by god , it 's great to have you here . it 's an honor . sorry i took so long getting to you , but we 've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do .
i may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread . two years is a long time for your comrades to wait .
thanks .
he missed three weeks .
yah , i see .
good . now we 're talking .
is that why you became a nazi ? so you could talk about jews incessantly ?
what i need to < u > say < /u > ...
no , that 's enough . i just wanted you to get the idea . now you know . this house is haunted .
stop !
you got to be fucking joking .
i抦 out of the doghouse ?
what ?
you think that 's a lot of money ?
and that 's where you met oswald for the first time ?
stay here . if we need you , we 'll know where to reach you .
open it up .
your superiors are two days away !
do n't you understand what i 'm telling you ? that 's why he wants me out of the way .
stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you . there 's something you 're not telling me , jimmy .
what ?
today has ben a good day . which under the circumstances is ... unexpected .
that goddamn neanderthal ? i 'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen ! did you know that ? !
i was just passing by and wondered how you were .
what are we gon na do up there ?
do you want to go get breakfast somewhere ?
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that you 've already bought my horse , and that it 's at doolan 's farm , where mick the groom is breaking it in . is that true , papa ?
i 'm not exactly having fun , either ... steady .
listen , did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ? this is a matter of principle . something you probably would n't understand . when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i do n't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege .
good morning , alexander . feeling up to some work ?
i do n't get it . how come there 's no rock 'n roll ?
victor , have a care ! you 'll make him dizzy !
i just want to be on my own for a while .
go in the house .
she set them up . all of them .
oh no you do n't . do n't you be getting corny on me , lee . i 'll kick your ass from here to compton .
maybe it 's time you got out .
i 'm glad i did n't ask you for `` washington crossing the delaware '' .
oh , christ , now we got ta listen to that grandfather thing again .
how to read .
juno . i wish i could say it 's a pleasure to see you again .
what 's this guy 's problem ?
sam , that old woman , whoever she is . i think she told arbogast something ! and i want her to tell us the same thing !
i want to be shown ... maurice would you do anything for me ?
i feel kind of sorry for him , all the same -
and now ... .
so what 's up ?
oh , the whole family loved him . of course , they loved the last guy i went out with , and he strung me along for three years and dumped me .
mr. wayne ... something wrong ?
what do you think ?
he 's not my friend , burt . but if he calls , or if he turns up here , then you give me a call in my room , okay ?
not in this thing .
hey ! -- you 're tickling me .
i mean it ! no one else would have helped . i take it all back , everything i 've said about you .
i should 've known . what 's the chief throwing you ?
ok , ok , i 'll give it back .
how are you making out in mr. fabian 's office ? i do n't want you working the child too hard , max - just because you promised . as you see , i kept my promise , too ...
it 's just that -- well , i 'm honored that you selected me , and everything , i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation ?
they 're here ! they 're inside the house -- !
i did n't mean to liz . i 'm sorry .
there have been messages for you . a lieutenant david wills called from the allied kommandatura cultural affairs office in wiesbaden . i do n't know who he is .
inadequate !
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something .
why would she care ?
the worst thing about you , monty , is you realize the futility of what you 're doing and you do it anyway . i wish you could see how transparent you are . this food tastes like shit .
go away .
you open ?
what ?
yes .
i told you to stay in the car !
ahhh ... a little high on the left , do n't you think ?
i do n't know what it is . it could be anything .
yeah ? yeah ? okay , kids , you can open the presents now .
what can we prove ?
quince , you ca n't unscramble scrambled eggs .
but it 's not totally hopeless for you ... i 've had it . i do n't even have the energy to try anymore . you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you do n't end up like me ...
yes .
exactly . what happened to your face ? did jackie treehorn do that as well ?
oh , i 'm just glad we have a catering job this week . i 'm real low on money .
what do we do ? what do you want to do ? !
yup .
a little . i just graduated from nyu film school . cinema studies .
michael , fredo 's in the house with mama . he asked for you , and tom said he could n't see you .
when ?
so tracy ?
not a problem .
but a fabulous cook .
it 's not only financial assistance . what he 's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money . it 's not going to happen on the phone .
i 'm here , dad . i 'm here .
right here . at the door .
no , i 'm saying you do n't include saturday ... in your three days . it 's not a business day .
so the fishing gaff method would n't make sense ?
what happened ?
what does that mean ?
got ta get the doctor someplace safe .
kayleigh ? do you ever think about `` us ? '' i mean , wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us ?
what happened to emma will never go away . it 's part of you now and it always will be . but you have to learn to live with it ...
then you better find it in your heart to tell me , francois , because while your death is inevitable , it still is n't decided how painful it 's going to be .
mostly tammy fans
yeah . that fernet tastes like tar . my grandfather tried to give me that .
where do i pull off ... ?
night !
ah duh . boys . i 've never even gone to first base with a guy . what do i do ?
in a sense we are all two people . the side we show in daylight . and that side we keep in shadow .
what is it , drugs ?
i do n't talk about it , you know ... no offense .
make sure you come right back , 'cause i 'm going to make lunch soon . okay ?
and i 'm tellin ' ya now , you 're a fool if you do n't get into it . a bigger fool than i was . i been lookin ' for this one all my life , johnny . now i got a chance to step out at the top .
shutup , you might learn somethin ' you 're not careful ... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over . there was a soil sample . non- specific mud traces of asphalt , oils , blah , blah ... sand and ... carnuba wax . so i became a wax expert . there 's 80 some uses for this stuff , something like five hundred products .
... . i hate to ask , but ... did you ever think you 'd miss communism ?
you 're not a bitch .
this way , daphne .
do what you do to simone .
what about the dog ?
i bought a beer . that was two- fifty . i bought a beer , otherwise i would have thirty .
what do you mean , i was n't there ? i remember distinctly . . .
put it down . put it on the ground .
... .-lene .
i 'm not married .
when can you leave ?
of rent i do not bullshit .
sometimes the poor do grow hungry . but why would they riot about it ?
stop crowdin the plate !
i was in the joint with him ! i knew about him and her , okay ! ? i took his place !
who put them up ?
i was in a hurry to do big things , make big mistakes . any mistakes were okay as long as it was big . but i 'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly . that 's the play they 're going to kill starting tonight . there 's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart . and that 's us . who we were and where we come from .
we did our part , we gotcha in mexico . now it 's time for your part , letting us go .
-- do n't `` man '' me , jimmy . where 's the key ?
he used to date pat benatar !
maybe it 'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles .
pleasure to meet you .
she 's not at that place you sent her ?
but i thought you 'd be cool if ...
no time for argument .
exactly . i do n't know what i 'd do without you .
i take a straight 15 percent . brill 's fee varies with risk . perhaps you 'd be more comfortable using someone else .
if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind , it could be devastating for him . imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world .
sure . i only sound like forty-year- old in your language .
you 're kidding , right ?
it is a living thing . when damaged - you would say 'wounded ' - it immediately 'heals ' itself .
phileas fogg ?
stop it -- stop it .
impossible ! impossible !
there 's so much i want to say to her , it 's all jumbled up in my mind , and i do n't want her to misunderstand --
marty , i do n't want you hang arounna house tonight . i want you to go take a shave and go out and dance .
hank ?
`` i only got my little girl now , '' he says , `` she 's my lifeline . '' then he tells me i ca n't be in the box anymore if i ca n't control myself . sonofabitch do n't even watch the damn game , just sits there drinking with his bidness friends , look up at the tv now and then . i do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people .
darlin ' , i still ai n't feelin ' so well . i 'm goin ' to bed .
whippin ' ai n't a little thing , alice .
mr. romance ...

almost four years .
get your links set up !
well , yes . groovy .
< u > ear plugs < /u > .
all i can get out of her is she do n't care about livin ' .
you bet .
i do n't know , yet . we 'll just have to watch our chance . when it comes i 'll know what to do -- i hope i 'll know what to do .
whenever you wish .
you 're my handsome man .
i 'm touched . kristel , check the chopper , let 's go .
wait ... he knows .
i got worried . are you ok ?
no ... cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity . all of them work for me , and you do n't ... let 's go .
this is rose , right ?
motion . stop there . play it again .
lock up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes mexico .
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
i know ben .
yes ?
who 's is all this ?
i can do anything i want ... and so can you ...
bye mom .
okay . let 's go shopping .
no . i just got distracted . i 'm so sorry .
but they know .
any holes ? nope . me and my brother dozer , we are 100 percent pure , old- fashioned , home-grown human . born free . right here in the real world . genuine child of zion .
the fear does not reach you . you have learned more than i anticipated .
i see what you mean .
really ?
the trouble is defining exactly what 'right ' is .
sara ... ?
there 's only one thing it could be ... short range scan .
yes .
okay . i 'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow . it does n't seem to be too long .
what are you going to do ? now that you 've quit the police force ?
the same thing -- his business pressures , the whole move and everything . he 's frantic about nailing this new job , worried about screwing over his present boss .
it 's a machine gun . this guy told me when i came to the big city i 'd have to have a machine gun , so i bought one . where do you get the money ? to pay for all this ? i mean the liquor , and the groceries , and the rent ?
i ca n't let him down .
me too .
you mean , like a trip ?
jeffrey , you thief !
dwayne please calm down !
our vaccine may have no effect !
yeah , live on my salary - that is , until i finish writing my play .
especially this last year .
you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now ?
must have a way with stationery .
there 's nobody else here ...
if she identifies him . where the fuck were you anyway , cowboy ! venza was meat . he walked right past you , and now we 're the ones playing catch-up ! you better hope she identifies him .
i can take care of myself . do n't worry .
what 's wrong ?
it nibbles . you see this ?
enterprise , this is starfleet operations . come in .
i know what people say , bill . i ... remember , back in high school i worked at my father 's gas station ?
you 're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend ! i do n't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns !
i 'm at nirdlinger 's . let yourself in .
okay . i 've been hogging it . you 're right . _ 76 .
ok. ok .
was up bitch ?
in the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
can we agree that that is that ?
oh . mary clarence , i 'm so unworthy . i want to take my final vows , i would do it tomorrow , but reverend mother wo n't let me !
and then we 'll arrest those greedy pigs ... is that it ?
thank you . thank you so much .
thanks again for your help !
what are you talking about ?
toon cops worked me over .
my life is gone . only life i was livin ' . and i lost it .
our man is sick . come right away .
makes your shoulders look so big and broad .
what 'd i say ?
huh .
pardon ?
good ! i 'm gon na be there .
that 's because the ones that were hurt , died . they could n't talk to you .
oh . oh god . i do n't care about anything . i do n't care about anything ! take me to the bed .
you wo n't die if you let me help .
you must be new in town .
ok , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ...
莂 alors ! from charles ?
yeah , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?
i do n't know yet . i 'm going to talk with dargus and nicolet today . do what you suggested . offer to help and see what happens .
i feel like driving .
or what ? you 've gone round the bend --
i think it 's fizzled out .
i want somebody very good , very safe to plant that gun . i do n't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand .
i know --
professor tripp .
you look like mush mouth from fat albert .
some job . card filing and cabinet dusting . four years in this dump and i have n't written anything for wilson that a wounded yak could n't do .
uh , v.i.p . security arrangements generally take some time , senator .
too far inland .
what did you say ? ! ? !
i 'm not hungry . you two just enjoy yourselves . after all , this is a celebration .
yeah ... well , maybe he should have . i mean , you brought the goddamn thing in here . maybe < u > you < /u > deserve to get slapped .
she 's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all . oh , i got rid of her , buddy , i did n't waste no time kickin ' that bitch out . hell , she was screwin ' everybody in savannah . i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin ' piss out of him !
look , look , just get off my property .
now look . do n't freeze up on me . i picked you because you had kind of a relaxed , go-with-the-flow quality . you 're not going to lose that , are you ?
you promised dad you would n't never tell !
it 's up to you entirely . do n't leave , then ...
then i 'd have to explain treadstone . and you 'd have to explain how you let me get this far . does n't sound like much of a plan-b , does it ? we 'll clean up the field . you clean up your budgets .
my boy 's special , well how about that . i knew you were different .
i want you to help me take my revenge .
no ...
you do n't mind ?
i reckon i can hear him . tv option , that 's a dollar twenty , makes nine eighty-six plus tax .
i tried to break it off !
it 's taken care of . the less you know about it the better .
nothing specific , but i 'll have my own place soon .
the reading could have been better , but you said it - now `` many happy returns of the day ... ''
i know something better .
mornin ' .
surely she is older ?
when did you make this , walter ?
i was going to ask .
that 's it . back to obedience school .
they decided to no-file . tell me where you are and i 'll bring you your money .
this is your last chance . tell us everything you know .
a nigger cook .
now ? i do n't think so . but i 've met him , of course , and we 've chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are . freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r .
he 'll file . he 's an ambitious man . ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others .
oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .
almost married . and almost a junior broker at e.f. hutton ...
party ? oh no , i can抰 go to a party ...
it does n't matter who they are .
did he say anything ?
i get off in another twenty minutes . i thought maybe we 'd all get a bite together .
it happens that i 'm the law .
now it makes total sense why she did n't want him to know we were in his office the other night .
it 's not like you 're going to lose anything . you can ask anyone in town . i 've been nothing if not generous . i want the best for everyone .
yeah kay , i 'm here .
i should n't .
we shoulda been there to back you up . we shoulda !
it was frankie tried to have me hit .
tonight and every night , my friend , for this is the second time you 've saved my life . i am ergo the magnificent , short in stature , tall in power , etcetera , etcetera .
oh no , not you again .
i whine . i-i-i sit and i whine .
i do n't know .
there 's a piano in the street .
you dumb bastard , you waited too long . if he made it back , this place would have been covered with police in a few hours . the way we 're moving , it 's going to be anyway .
it sounds to me like everybody 's just a little jumpy . and since all it is is a drop , the welshman 's got nothing at stake . i say we go to his 'troughed off ' bar . it 'll calm his nerves , we drop the bag , and we all get back to our lives .
snow shovel or anything or something .
here you are . would anyone like coffee ?
i ca n't ! it 's out of control !
because the rabbits are us , donnie .
red sox ... who 's on the mound ?
charlie , it 's just no go . we ca n't agree anymore . i wish you 'd let me go to chicago .
i feel tight -- but good .
oh , yeah , you 're just so smart .
now , you 've probably already guessed that george never leaves bedford falls .
i do n't freak out very often .
mm hmm .
goodnight , sir .
i have a small window of time .
but you 're not alone .
a samurai has honor , a samurai live by the code of bushido , the way of the warrior . i 'm just a killer for hire . the world is n't about honor , anymore . it 's about survival .
come on , frederico , do you really have to go back ? at least stick around for the festival of the madonna .
he got hit by a bus .
well , i think he was dying to open up . it 's so sad . now ... what should i wear to my audition ?
no !
come in ... come in ... peace on earth ... peace on earth ... yes ...
uh , uh , did he go to the restaurant ? i ... i ...
it wo n't ?
i gave that up when my wife got sick .
you did n't tell anyone where you were ?
it 's just that there 's less that adam and ryan can do anymore . i 'd hate to have them bored .
ah , but we have even more in common with our creator . come , i am like a mother tonight . i want a child .
call me tomorrow .
you 're fired .
you ai n't going in alone ?
that is my daughter . she say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon . i am sorry , mr. jimmy . i will make it short .
did that help ? did you learn anything ?
what ?
well ... i 'll act like i do until i do .
of god .
do n't crowd him .
oh , yes .
darling , you must encourage the troops -- wave !
she 's murdered her hair ... you do something with her , i 'm never going to touch her again .
oh , how nice ! thank you very much .
their statements , naming chief cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to oxnard . i want them to have federal protection under the paper 's sponsorship .
i 'm afraid some harm may come to her .
where do you get your ideas ? only joking -- i 'm just joking . let 's go to a brothel then , kafka , come on .
where you gon na go ?
your cousins go out with him .
i-i d-d-do n't know ! m-m-miss r ratched g-g-g-g ...
is that for me ?
what about your toe ?
i went for a walk .
continue on course . chekov , any signs of federation escort ?
i was just thinking that .
your father knew it too . but he was never sure how much was pretense .
there 's no disturbance .
i want to sleep ... i have n't slept for three days .
here -- here . go 'way and let us alone !
nothing . are you alright ?
what about starks ?
hey ! you want good stuff , or you want shit ?
aye , he looks a right lurker .
i think he likes you . i think i do too .
yeah ... wow .
i have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves ! can you imagine the arrogance ? common jesuit priests try to act as my equals , and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order ! no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can , and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold . even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france ! he suspects the governor general of jesuits , whoever he is , is angling to become pope himself .
well , sir ...
he 'd rather die than be with you , he 'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway . bury him all over the place .
twenty-after-ten .
no .
now ?
mom , i have a real job . i do good things for this community . i help people .
i 'm okay with that .
kyle , check it out .
everybody knows --
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country .
six ...
oh .
but of course yours worked .
i am not sure ... it could be twice the distance .
captain , i 've found the borg sphere . it 's on the far side of the planet ... firing at the surface .
nothing , unless you object to having girls here .
i 'm pretty nervous . are you ?
she knows . clever , very clever . and unappreciated . but i 'm going to take you away from all this .
that 's right , mr. stone -- there is -- -- just one little formality . i 'd like your signature here -- see . and when it 's done -- it 's done for seven years . it 's our usual form . of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time .
what did you say ?
i do n't understand . i thought that you would be happy .
there she is . i got visual .
could 've fooled me . go away .
something like that .
all i know is -- he said to me tonight -- `` what does your wife think ? '' my wife . thinks we 're married --
-- we might as well be frank , monsieur . it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca . and the germans have outlawed miracles .
e mo va ! [ italian-american slang for 'now , go ! ' ]
led by the warlike queen louisa , and her fashion-minded husband , king frederich wilhelm , the prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of frederick the great , and more than a match for napoleon . the king had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms , and was personally involved in the design of all the prussian army uniforms .
we 'll think of something .
what 's that mean ?
jack , is n't that fred bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck ? maybe he 's on our flight to chicago .
so some people need different kinds of `` convincing '' than others ... . hey , just sign the petition !
he wants us to know he 's hunting us now .
anyone else not coming ?
new worlds .
... and look , i 'm sorry as hell about the interruption . too much revelry late at night , you forget there are other people in the world .
i 'm about to blow the wall .
what took you so long ? is it hot ?
can you reconstruct the throttle valve ?
better than a pile of dead teenagers .
i 'm fine .
leaving what ?
the staff don抰 know yet ... i called my parents , told them everything ... i just couldn抰 take any more ...
i 'm frightened , mitch .
benjamin franklin , he discovered electricity .
i do n't have to do anything except survive . and it 's taking everything i 've got just to do that .
yes , some of the time .
yes , i hear it .
because they gots a window with a dogs in it . you want me to `` push in . '' or i can lose the shot .
what ?
a l抋chat , trois ou quatre mille . en location , cinq cent . mais 鏰 pourrait faire plus . je ne sais pas . c抏st pas vraiment mon truc . i don抰 know any austrian , xavier .
open this door !
no ... a job ... i did n't know what . he set up an appointment for me to see a man .
maybe we should make the time . especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events .
well , i 'd make an exception in this case if i were you .
christ , i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day , and i tell myself i could be worse . it 's just so damned pleasurable .
i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up .
look . they 're together . you telling me this ai n't a set-up ?
i know , but mr. garrison , the fbi is just not doing their job .
i thought we were just having a conversation . you seem to be reading all this meaning into it . meanings i must be too simple to , uh ... interpret or something .
do n't tell me you 're on his side . again .
i do n't know nothing about it .
was someone in an accident ?
no , my boy . i 'm afraid none of us can .
what the hell 's going on !
threepio ! shut down all garbage mashers on your level ... do you copy ? ? threepio , shut down all garbage ...
a big one ... .
there 's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger .
you know what that 'll do to our fuel consumption .
just felt a little chill .
what do you want ?
i do n't know ...
o deadly sin , o rude unthankfulness ! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not . hence !
do n't ask me those questions dear , i 'm not the patient .
i ca n't get it to go up .
tell me about him . you must have lernt something from him ! it had to happen for you as it did for me !
you know , i 've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist . nothing penetrates that night . nothing .
you want me to go around --
anyway . how much they offer you ?
wait ! jesus christ ! you 're fucking crazy , you know that ? you go in there you 're gon na eat it on the rocks . here , follow me .
my mother is not dead !
i ... i do n't know ...
ahh , not so good , man .
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area ...
there 's no choice .
... you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . is n't that what you did ?
is there someplace we can talk ?
no . i was busy . yes , i need the new poll fig ... . < u > how < /u > long ? i 'll call in from nashville . and patch me through to the big bird , will ... ? i 've got to < u > hand < /u > it to you . < u > they < /u > sure let us out of there easy ... .
i 've just got a few --
what the hell was that ! what did you think ? did you think it was loaded !
i was telling your wife , we have a very good case here .
some bicarbonate - quick !
what < u > is < /u > your problem ?
what a great son you are , ranon . i wish i could take you with me . now go to sleep ...
good . you 've both been working close to the front .
they do n't care about all the things we do right . [ beat ] but they might ... they might care about what we 're doing wrong . [ beat ] that 's what they should come here to look for .
all right . do it !
oh , my god , you found it . thank you so much . did you get your tape ?
what if we blow the walkways first ? leave jason over here to go up with the ship ?
i am happy to say that this bag is officially empty .
forget it .
apparently , fine . he 's coming into work . that 's the good news ...
my daughter .
i wish i could tell you . i ca n't pretend to know what we 're dealing with here . i 'll notify the cdc and --
good-bye , darling . i love you . i love you , darling .
yes !
what do you mean ?
try sitting down .
i ca n't tell you that .
... who ?
i was going to talk to bembry about it tonight .
now are you going to get a regular job ?
you think it can go faster than an f- 36 ?
a cold ? of course .
just because some slag抯 been paid for , doesn抰 mean you抳e got to ... you know .
you 're not too good at this , are you , r.k. ?
i think they hear you !
i 'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty . what i have in mind is massage -- a perfectly decent massage . turn around , turn around .
how 's she doing ?
i want you to do something for me , baby .
i used to hate it . now i like it .
she was hot .
he 's ... near .
sure .
oh , jesus ! ! hellboy -- ? ? is real --
no idea who . no idea why ...
come on , claudette . a man 's not made of stone .
i 'm not surprised . can we save anywhere ?
then you must get it .
how much did you lose ?
what 's this ?
money .
he 's right , we ca n't get into the room if they 're dead !
this is not how you do it . you want this on an english muffin or a bun ?
hi .
yes . look at me . look at our -- the apartment . what else do i have , other than records and cds ?
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us ? she 's giving me crap about being away from peter and now you 're trying to do the same thing ! what no one seems to realize is that peter is n't there ! he 's not there ! and when he is , he is n't ! so , if you do n't want me here , or you do n't want my kids here , just tell me , george . i 'll stop coming . but it wo n't be because of peter . it 'll be because you asked me to stop . say what you need to say , because i 'm not leaving until i hear it .
the dead get out ?
what do you think he did ?
it was destined that i came here -- and the future can not be changed ...
what happen ?
corridor a .
no . but i 'm open to distractions .
kip took a job . fifty ladies in two weeks . only the two weeks have turned into four days . and not a single lady has been snared .
some girl that 's been hanging on at every party . now i 'm supposed to be her baby 's daddy . anyway , i told your mom i wanted to be the one who told you .
and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since .
o.k. , kid -- i 'm only sorry for one thing .
they want to discredit you -- for what ?
cold is good !
oh , no , it 's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt .
flynn ! look , tron , he survived !
well ... i 've got another project i was n't gon na tell you about . lugosi 's in it , but he 's got a smaller part . the lead is an ingenue , a sterling young actress named dolores fuller . the title is `` bride of the atom . ''
you must really think i 'm a square , a computer nerd .
come on , you ...
i never heard that .
what time is it now ?
you did , huh ? good for you .
that little old man .
yeah even then look what happened : michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me .
maybe i was wrong on that one .
shit . we 're still putting the victim list together . you 'll need a forklift for the case file . i suggest you hire some help , and do n't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months . you 're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in american history .
they will ! you tell them if they do n't come now , i will shoot you !
why am i doing this to you ? is n't this what you wanted ?
how ?
hi . sorry . you okay ? you look as if you 've seen a ghost ...
well , they 're aspiring to be sevens .
why ?
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills ...
not this time . i owe cotton that much . hell , even i thought that man was guilty .
bastard ! is n't it great , tom ? i found it in naples . i bargained for about two weeks .
okay , what ?
well , the reward still stands ...
aah , it 's kind of a hike .
we got ta go underground . get those guys out , now .
you look familiar . did i have your brother ?
lou sklaroff , vin badalato , dave montell .
leave me alone , brother . i 've never seen you before . tramp shouts to other meths drinkers and tramps .
surely you know the one who made you ...
it wo n't take them that long to figure out we were n't on the train when it wrecked .
let 's make a deal . you shut up .
no . i 'm scared .
the only thing is ... you should n't keep this in the house . we got ta put it in a bank .
she could have been killed ... you knew and you did n't tell us ... you let your mother think ... .
pulse , slow , very little pressure .
oh ! you did that on purpose ! i hate you . go gargle with razor blades !
oh , yes . it would probably kill him .
really ? do you have the money with you ?
seems like a pretty open-minded guy , huh ?
tell the guy , get me the horse , i 'll give him an associate producer credit .
got a job for you .
no , of course .
by order of the master of the revels !
yes ?
no --
take mexico .
welcome to venice . this place reeks , does n't it ? can you smell it ? ugh . sorry . not the best way to spend your first day .
hello , mimi .
hi .
and ?
then you 've heard too .
one night with me !
how strange . and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information . only three people here . you 're sure ?
thatcher ! that man was the biggest darn fool i ever met -
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously .
-- no , have you had any experience with that ?
aye . speak then if ye must .
what do you want from me ?
i know she liked me . i mean , it 's not like i wanted to do anything with her tonight .
i was in love once , willow . she had a hold on my heart . i could barely function . i *was* a great swordsman ! i was knighted ! i could have been king !
whoever 's doing the herding is gon na have their hands pretty full . i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it 's inside , and to serve as ... as ...
what 's the deal ? did anybody make a decision -
why did you send me after friedman ? to atone for your sins ?
so what are you going to do ?
yes .
here , here , what 's all this jabber-wapping when there 's work to be done ? i know three shiftless farm hands that 'll be out of a job before they know it !
what belongs to the people ?
you could say . i do n't even have it yet .
gosh , pop -- head of the boy rangers !
oh , you 're speaking of my charming wife mrs. alabama worley .
but why ?
sir . i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding . i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse , laughter through tears , but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously .
because they are here . because tsavo is the worst place in the world . come , john- to the bridge .
now let 's see ... eton , cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics . overtaken by peter 's work on the physics of climate change ...
you black ?
you 've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning . how come you always save me for last , james ? when are you gon na learn . shit do n't happen i do n't know about .
what was my mama like ?
the references are to hansard or to newspapers . i have n't got the actual speeches now . you 'll have to chase them up .
i like to play `` reality '' .
how much ... ?
feel free to lie down . most people do .
it was n't him ! it was you , charley . you and johnny . like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says , `` kid , this ai n't your night ? we 're going for the price on wilson . '' it ai n't my night . i 'd of taken wilson apart that night ! i was ready ? remember the early rounds throwing them combinations . so what happens ? this bum wilson he gets the title shot ? outdoors in the ballpark ! ? and what do i get ? a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to palookaville . it was you , charley . you was my brother . you should of looked out for me . instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money .
it 's dragon . dragon ... red dragon .
no , icky , this is real .
i 'm hungry
yeah , i 'd believe it .
aye , ok , fr . but the good times could n't last for ever .
fine . just slipped . this is my blood .
that 's not the point .
let 's take a carozza and look at the moon .
you 're looking for a bomb .
i did n't ...
i think you testified < u > all < /u > the lights were on . cabin , mast , net lights , picking lights ...
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment ! dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say 'ay , ' and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st , thou mayst prove false . o gentle romeo , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully :
what would you do , dad ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't come here to blame you .
not the first time that 's been true . i 'm telling you , i got a feeling about this guy . this is the guy , satch .
this looks to me like a good sign . do n't you think so ? as far as i 'm concerned , anyone who reads the bible could not have committed an act of impropriety . why ... as a matter of fact , i remember when i was in china , many years ago , i happened to be involved in a similar situation , concerning an english woman , the wife of ambassador shafford , a good friend of mine . there , too , we found a bible ... and i said at the time that whatever had happened , that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of ... suicide . why , it was logical , i said , that whoever reads the bible believes in god and therefore ... no ? you do n't believe it ? well , as a matter of fact , i was right ... the woman was found two days later . it was a case of amnesia .
arrrghhh ! ah jeez ... christ ...
i ca n't go anywhere , diego . i 'm on parole . i ca n't leave the state .
is that one of the who 's who ?
mischief ? what the fuck you talkin ' about , mischief ?
could you possibly try not to hit every single one !
i thought you were gon na throw these ?
i was going nuts in that waiting room so i came back to check on my mom .
i said do n't go between them !
no .
i - r saw him as a child . lots of times ... but no one else did .
keep it anyway . i have another one at home .
too late for what ? too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ? well , you wo n't do it , i tell you . you wo n't do it !
i have to go home and get my things .
thank you , herb . you 're a wonderful man . you really are . everybody respects you for what you 've done for scouting and the little league .
oh , let me get out of your way then .
15 6-gigs here ... 90 gigs total ... other ship carries 20-gig cells , so ... five . five total to launch .
now and then . why , do you ?
hold still , del , we 're just talking here ... then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut . it 's amazing how easily the scalp comes off .
you 'll not need that again , georgina .
you 're a liar !
why let rocky here take a chance on cuttin ' or breakin ' a hand ? -- take a shower , dipper .
it 's beautiful .
holy christ ... .
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest .
you got a dog ?
tell me about them .
i do n't want to go to the dentist .
who says i do n't like you ?
was he really upset when you told him ?

we disappear for awhile . we disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .
there was that ammunition train in the depot at frankfurt , see ? so dunbar gets himself in the men 's room and fixes a time bomb , see ? then he waits until the train starts moving out , see ? and one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor , see ? so he throws it , see , and three minutes later -- voom ! see ?

he 's still got a good grip . we need to dig more .
- right..
you 're not cleared for this precinct . let 's cross over first .
hey ...
we 'll be fine .
well ... we should n't rush into this , right ? let 's talk about it .
i know this sounds weird , mr. sutphin , but the department of motor vehicle 's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of mr. stubbins ' pupils .
we 're looking into it bob , but they really want you to stay to do that talk show friday , apparently it 's a really big deal , he 's the johnny carson of japan .

seems like there 's more of it than ever before --
what job and how much ?
well , if it is n't the ripper hisself .

he made friends with a family called columbier , and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter , caroline .
what are you doing here ?
last thing we want is extra partners .
let 's just slow down for a second ...
stop . everyone is looking .
who was that other guy ?
i tried it once ... fourteen years ago ... 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father . the only thing i 'm good at is this ... at least until yesterday .
worms was comin ' out .
identify him , then . speak to him .
in school .
it 'd cost you .
the lunch hour . he probably worked it out in advance . he found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here .
i 'm sorry . i could n't possibly ...
[ why ? ]
and you 're not one to lie , are you ?
i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and --
you have a name , missy ?
... almost nine minutes ... causing brain damage .
that 's good .
yeah . those . that always put the fear of god in me . what about you ?
right . lap-dancers are people too .
alright , how 'bout all your fuckin ' money ?
i loaned him to jennifer . george moved out and she was lonely ...
i 'm sorry , but i sleep better when i know i 'm with the winning side .

yes . before we hand in the next video - i put titles on it and my credit is going to read - directed by oleg razgul .
let 's remember how i got into this . `` please , eddie , do this for me . i ca n't get a break . ''
the taj mahal was n't a palace , it was a tomb . why did n't he tell us ?
hey cartman .

i leave that in your hands .
no , i ca n't wait . you know when i wait ? when it 's important to wait . it 's not important to wait for no steak . it 's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring . it ai n't important to wait for no steak ! i won that fight . so , i stayed in the ring , and that way i made sure everybody knew it . i shoulda knocked him out earlier , sonofabitch .
how 'd you get this number ?
i 'm sorry .
you 'd better be quiet , sandy .
jesus ! what ? ! you want money ? !
yeah ... then should n't this be all of us together .
go to your reunion , martin . see those people and discover what they mean to you . try not to kill anybody for a few days , see how you feel .
from now on , if we 're seen together , it 's got to be accidental . i thought that was understood ...
there is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product ...
let抯 go , jock .
yeah . you did n't wan na take me to the prom .
david ferrie .
okay , willard , sit down .
what 's up ?
how come you 're not at lunch with the girls ? you 're a girl .
hey , can you guys hear me ?
it 's okay , stephen , i --
it 's all controlled from the control room .
`` vicki . '' ice-skater , or stewardess ?
no . she ordered them special . took her forever to find them . they 've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in sanskrit . we 've got to go back . christine 'll fucking crucify me .
wally ... ?
you 're going ?
congratulations . you get to die on the dean 's list .
what 'd owens mean ? 'bout not touching the switch ?
exactly two minutes difference ... and it 's still ticking !
yeah , ai n't it swell ?
we 've got to help each other .
i mean i 'm not stealing the fucking car .
because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends .
i do n't like my real name .
hey , okay .
what is it ?
nor i ! i want to live ! i want a home and children and peace . i 've asked god for those things . but he 's brought me this sword . and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country , then i 'll do that too .
what ?
everyone describes the same process . at first it is exciting . you 're at the centre of the world . as soon as anything happens , you 're the first to know about it . and there are deadlines a dozen times a day , even more , and that 's intimidating and exciting . then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off . your a clerk in a rather dowdy office . there 's none of the glamour of television , or the penetration of serious journalism . you 're a processor of semi-official news . some people leave at this stage . then , if you hang on , and especially if you 're promoted , you discover a new kind of pleasure . you 're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts , by the way you ca judge length . ending a broadcast on the dot , having everything run smoothly , selecting a running order that makes sense , knowing instinctively what you can and can not do . professionalism .
jesus christ , what the hell are you doing here ? what 's going on ? who 's upstairs ?
what ?
well , i know , more so . that 's why i was thinking ... maybe she 'd be better off .
oh , still sore about this .
from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .
of course . but , i 'm certain it 's nothing to worry about .
i use it ... to fight evil .
of course .
raoul ... is in love ...
man . fuck you guys . i have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical .
you 're killing him . you 're killing him for nothing . stop it .
ca n't you tell me later ?
what would you do in my place ?
go for a walk in central park --
word ! ! !
urdu and hindi .
you 're just back from corto maltese . i saw your combat photos . quite a departure for you .
aunt barbara . i 'll try not to get depressed .
do you know where you 're going ?
it is possible , holiness .
yes i 'll sing and know joy evermore
what course , skipper ?
m'sieu laval , madame would like to talk to mademoiselle gautier for a moment .
we 're almost done . hi . yeah ... no , it 's excluded . they 've already paid the earnest money ... well , let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through . right , great , sounds good !
if i call them , and they come what on earth am i going to say to them .
no ... it 's nothing to do with you . it 's just that i was scared of coming back . now , after all these years , i thought i was strong , that i had forgotten lots of things . instead , i find it 's quite the opposite , as if i had never left . and yet , i look at lia and feel as if i did n't know her , and you , mamma ... i abandoned you , ran away like a thief , thought only of myself , and never gave you an explanation ...
you promised to stay on the wagon .
her place is down the road . but she just comes out for weekends sometimes .
we ca n't stay in here !
slick as snot and i 'm not lying .
yeah , to see if we 're on our toes .
dark and large . with vines -- no , not vines . not alive .
what about the other five percent ?
when was this ?
scott haydn is dead . he died about three months ago . we went to the funeral .
dickie greenleaf ?
good ? good , paulie ? ! i 've been treatin ' you like a baby . since i ca n't remember it 's so long -- i 'm the only one who feeds you an ' puts you in bed when ya ca n't stand up -- and it 's you that made me feel like a loser -- that 's what ya use to call me 'loser ' -- what kind of name is that ? so can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when i 'm with rocky -- i do n't owe you , paulie , you owe me .
you have n't threatened to take away my books yet .
yes . theoretical discoveries aside , there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ?
but they do n't have a case against you .
i 've known a lot of everybody .
yes ... why ?
you did it for me .
mcteague .
damn .
pooh 's dusty , sweetheart ... he 's dusty , and you breathed him in , okay ? so what 's -- what 's happening to you now is ... cells called mast cells told your lungs `` do n't breathe any more of that dust in . '' ... and the airways in your lungs are like branches . and when the branches close up , you get an asthmatic attack . and , we give you medicine , and you get better . huh ? okay ? you 're better already , are n't you ?
that would suit me perfectly . i 'm always broke . how did you pay for them ?
he did n't offer you money .
thanks , thanks .
last night i said i missed my fuckin ' wife ... tonight i just miss my fuckin ' bed .
he 's on to something bigger .
yes , sir .

i do n't have to look at anything . i do n't have --
no , the goddamn game 's not over ! it 's never over when you 're playing against a team that does n't care if they win or lose -- how do you negotiate with someone like that ? !
no she 's not .
good afternoon , officer . bit of trouble here ?
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it . he 's got ta cap all three of us before they even read our rights . he 's probably planning it right now .
i 'm sorry .
you 're being really immature .
now wait justa minute ! you do n't tell me what you ai n't gon na do ! i tell you ! i say , you goin ' to that school , you goin ' ! you hear me !
hey .

just ask me what you want to know .
margaret .

oh ... uh , thanks a lot enid ... i really appreciate it ...
i have a professional relationship with rachel banks . she 's the go- between for a private investigator i use .

there were admirals .
just three questions . the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $ 4500 ?
you 're telling me that , i should take my daughter to a witch doctor ? is that it ?
yes , but very well .
or maybe we 're exactly where they want us to be .
uh , huh huh , this is las vegas ?
did i ?
anything else you can tell me about owen ?
we 're going to go someplace new .
from whence did it come ? our information states it came from a small group of armed , dissidents . of armed and violent dissidents ...
cowan --

fifty , right ?
i have to admit , i am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .
oh -- oh .
but you did have a salvation army- thing going .
look , brad , i 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this . we 're almost out of high school , this is our last year . i think we owe it to ourselves to be free , and meet some new people . then , if we get back together , we 'll know it 's the right thing .
it抯 cute .
well ... there 's still some cell activity ... it 's not entirely dead yet .
yeah , but where 's the third guy ?
because going down it 's a big deal ! i used to like a guy , we 'd make out , and sooner or later i 'd go down on him . but i only had sex with the guys i loved .
you had to do _nothing_ !
no , hanna . my heart is n't that black .
as the trucks go .
you got that ?
do they have the report ? have you discussed it with them ?
she 's beautiful , you know ?
who was that man last night ?
tis a fair question . if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap .
do n't expect you to mention it to him . i 'm just saying , if --
can it be repaired ?
thank you . excuse me .
vince ...
could you stop , please . you 're giving me a headache .
after dinner , if hanna is n't back ? can we try a few more sketches ?
i ahh , better go .
no , he 's off tonight . where was he last night ?
wow . should you tell my father ?
bodies 're too fresh .
i take it this file is still open .
look , harry 's not part of this . he 's just a sales rep .
what ?
oh , yeah . but see , i 've never really been into sex that much , i mean , i like it and everything , it just does't freak me out , i would n't miss it , you know ? but anyway , lately we have n't been doing anything at all . like i said , it 's not that i miss it , but i 'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden .
fuck you . i 'm running this shit . you talk to me .
you aim a gun at me ? ! do you know who i am ? ! i am gino marzzone . you understand ?
now what ?
uh huh .
i 've tried calling and writing . i want to reach michael .
i do n't think so . just reach on in .
uh , let what ? i do n't -- uh , what do you mean ? who ?
great .
hey . why do n't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that does n't involve mass suicide ?
hey murph .
you should n't be up .
skip on to the fire swamp -- that sounded good .
well , he 'd have to hurry . my flight leaves at four o'clock .
hiya carla .
what 'd he look like again ?
maybe she did , gus . maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face . let 's polygraph her again and ask her about it .
what do i do ?
eh , the financing just fell through for the third time on `` don quixote . '' so i 'm trying to finish a promo for something else . but i ca n't find the soundtrack -- i think i left it in malta .
what 's to discuss ?
oh . goodness .
not me . but other people seem to .
i 'm sure of it . just as i 'm sure there 's a wish for shangri-la in everyone 's heart . i have never seen the outside world . but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy . yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security , where there 's beauty and comfort , where they would n't have to be mean and greedy . oh , i just wish the whole world might come to this valley .
i am not a bad man .
i was devastated . of course .
that 's something i suppose .
it 's from one of those p.o . boxes . how was the trip ?
let him break - he likes to break .
so it seems .
let 's just say they got a passion for collectibles ...
not yet , honey ...
you know , you 're pushy , fella ...
my mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip .
oh , that 's so interesting !
oxbridge academy ?
why ?
excuse me ?
do they know ?
every night i think about you sleeping with him , him slobbering all over you .
then where 's the chip .
you must be discouraged .
what 's this about the boston strangler , m.j. ?
trust me .
i 'm terribly sorry she is n't here .
everything would have been better if you had . you 'd have liked your grandmother . and there 'd be a girl out there that 'd have her mother . i remember reading about her in the paper . they could n't find her father and her mother was dead . i still feel guilty about that .
i 've been doing some morning show stuff , but mostly radio -- that does n't bother me . i 'm in no rush for anything . it 's just the snotty attitude , even if i have it coming , it 's still ...
sera ... what you do n't understand is ...
if only we had n't made this journey . if only the car had n't broken down . if only we were amongst friends or sane persons .
sweeney ? well , after all , he did n't do it on purpose , did he ?
i do n't .
what 'd you wish , george ?
that 's his headache .
this is nicer than your other apartment .
they just walked out . the smaller man -- he must be dominican or haitian -- he kicked me so hard . i felt a rib crack but i never made a sound . it 's starting to hurt now -- real bad . a throbbing . i ca n't even take a deep breath .
i 've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher . we 're not to discuss him with the press , the n.y.p.d. , anyone . building police are to arrest him on sight and we 're to report any attempt he makes to contact you .
you must bow down to the almighty bunghole . heh heh , this is cool . bungholio-o-o-o-o-o !
there goes a thousand dollars .
no .
so saw my hands off , i left you a present .
thank you .
this is for the best , you know it is . why do my socks keep disappearing !
it抯 about the puppy . you got the money ?
fine .
it 's not too bad . it 's a tragedy ! why does she have to be in love with a jerk ? !
shoot , lothar .
the name 's rico , at my own father 's grave , a man deserves some respect .
like you .
my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder . our lives have crossed because two lions went mad . but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity ? was that worth all the lives ? too soon to tell .
well , it was nice meeting you , again .
yes ?
if it did n't happen in louisville , it 'd happened someplace else . if it did n't happen now , it 'd happen six months from now . that 's the kinda dame she was .
yeah ? and what are you going to do tonight ?
yeah , he said it was routine too . now it 's two guys saying it 's routine .
it抯 lovely ...
why do n't you go make some coffee .
father !
lucky . lucky , lucky , lucky .
hi , again . sorry about ...
elvis i like , too .
what do you see here ?
how disappointing ! i expected it was something more romantic . a temple to the goddess of love , perhaps .
what above the curves ? !
at least we know he has n't got it . just keep nodding as though i 'm giving orders . saavik , punch up the data charts of reliant 's command console -- hurry ...
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox . i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game . my wife is from boston . lillian ziegler ?

[ something very important . i have been threatened ; ] mrs. maxwell , my assistant 's wife , is crazy . she thinks i mur- dered her husband . [ she wants to murder me . ] i want you to help me quiet her -- give her a shot from this hypo . [ keep it hid till we get her ] down in the basement -- there is a secret vault [ there ] . we will put her there till we get your husband -- [ then turn her over to the authorities . then we will both be free . ]
then why let her out of our sight ? besides , she 's all we 've got ...
i have a map .
he does n't need the money . he inherited a fortune . he kills for kicks . tv battles between non-predator fish and divers . the diver always wins .
no sound at all ?
... break away completely from --
i 've got to admit , that was a damn sight better than `` the dog ate my homework '' .
look at this -- `` lollipop lolitas '' - is n't child pornography totally illegal ?
okay , whatever . come on chris !

he found us even there .
all right , lem me ask you something . let 's say i was a good friend of yours . and i was telling you i was gon na bet a lot of money on you in this janiro fight . what would you tell me ?
yeah , whatever they are , you 'd think after they ate all those sheep they 'd have to take a dump someplace ... what the hell 's going on in town ?
it 's funny , you knew . but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen . maybe that 's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt .
what , are you kidding ? see that book ? i 've been trying to get through that book ever since i first got here . i have n't finished the first chapter . did you read all them books ?
i 've no money .

i closed my christmas club .
well , i think time is like a burrito . sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other .
alvy , you 're a total paranoid .
well , you see , i 've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws , and we were afraid she would n't understand the whole idea . so we were going to wait till she went to europe .
... i 've got a right to say something . i mean , you 're tying my hands here ! they say you 're not ready to know .
vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather .

that 's right . i told you we had a fight -- that 's what it was about -- miss olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
why , i believe the little woman cares .
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage ?
it 's easy for you to be patient .
it might help my analysis if i knew what genesis was .
i 'm about to break that beach wide open , and i do n't need some pennyante woodward and bernstein getting in the way of my men .

florentino ! he 's getting away !
we could take the six o'clock train , hildy . if it would save a man 's life .
send him down to her . there 's money in my duffel bag , back at his cabin .
whenever an employee departs , shall we say , it 's up to the head of his department to requisition his file , reassign any outstanding claims , and send it off .
he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet ! what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet ?
help you ?
okay .
we do n't have time .
watch out for dick low , he 's a liar ; he has his own world . there was a junior agent in seattle , not unlike you , an agent who fell under dick 's spell . he 'd have done anything for agent low . richard got this agent to take a suspect to the crime scene , beat him up , force a confession -- all unauthorized , all illegal . the agent died that night , killed by the suspect . richard low got him killed . worst of all , we had to hush it up , let the suspect go . the suspect was george sheldon , the second man richard killed .
whatever .
check-out time ! please vacate the room .
until you 're on the net where the corporation ca n't touch you , you ca n't open the system . they 'll eject it if you do .
if you do n't mind , this could be important .

mary clarence , are you with us ?
do what it is in your nature to do . and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms .
how about me what ?
yes , you are . look we know oswald did n't pull that trigger . castro did . but if that comes out , there 's gon na be a war , boy - millions of people are gon na die . that 's a hell of a lot more important than jim garrison . goddammit , look at me when i talk to you ! you 're too goddamn self- opinionated , now shut up . if you got a brain in that thick skull of yours , listen to me . listen real hard .
okay sure . what about ?
careful how you point that gun , boy .

i 'm actually beginning to enjoy this .
do you understand , neo ?
marla , no , wait ...
stop hiding harry , you run harry . when i first came here , the idea of working with dead people , did n't exactly thrill me , but when i saw a family lived here , i thought , & quot ; if i 'm living without a family , at least i can work with one , and maybe once in a while i 'll be invited in for supper. & quot ;
veidt . you 're the one who started world war iii .
most men are .
if we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
what size ?
miss kubelik , i do n't think that 's such a good idea .
no you 're not .
is it you ?
she 's the boss .
we 're getting ahead of ourselves . we have n't gotten any sleep . let 's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes . now hurry up and get your shit on so we 're not late and make things worse .
i hate reading .
how fast does this go ?
sorta like stealing cars and selling 'm for parts , huh ?
cockroaches ?
i had to ask . i apologize .
good , it was all right .
i know this . bach . f minor concerto . it 's one of my favorites .
right -- well , then we have something of an impasse . i tell you what -- i 'll call the police -- and , what can i say ? -- if i 'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario , i really apologize .
i wasn抰 saving you from him . i was saving you from yourself .
which one is elijah again ?
i have taken vows . more than one . i 've vowed faithfulness to my husband , and sworn to give him a son . and i can not keep both promises .
that 's it ? probably ? look , sharks are attracted by blood , and thrashing around ... .
yes .
not for years .
how long will these take ?
there 's another reason ? it better be good .
just take it easy . -- where are the others ?
i already explained about that .
yeah ? well i 'm not starting now .
that 's right .
the money 's in a broadway shopping bag . i get some food , and sit down here in the food court . then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet ?
i had no idea until after , but --
yes . he brought me in his carriage , and he will call for me at midnight .
i ... think we need to talk , there 's something really strange going on ...
this had better be good .
one day before we know it it 'll be an old house and we 'll be old in it -- and i 'll still be paying for it .
anyway ... i did my time on door-to-doors , and walking a beat . i did all that shit for a long time .
this makes five .
he dugged his own grave .
one toke . you poor fool . wait till you see those goddamn bats .
never heard of him .
you 're looking magnificent , leon ... ... is n't he , general savitzky ?
and some of it 's mine . edward , his jugular 's exposed .
bad luck to see death in the snow .
what a horrible little person .
right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
they 'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you 'll start seeing things differently -- plus they 'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters .
hi . are you calling from jail ?
brad , please lets get out of here .
sir , i think no such thing .
soon , captain ... quite soon .
considering what ?
the forager 's back .
there is sand enough for only one life . go now , save the other .
domini ?
i beg your pardon .
i do n't believe it . i come all the way down down here , break a heel , and you 're not gon na give me a chance because i have gum on my lip and i 'm a few minutes late .
where are we ?
could n't you 've just pulled him off me ?
you 'd like me to kill them ?
patrick ? is that you ?
you said , `` will it change ... '' wife . will it change ...
who ? a scab ?
dr. furtw鋘gler is a great musician . he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape .
he 's still out there ! ! !
i sprayed your apartment . i took your key . i really did n't mean to do anything but see you .
that 's true , would n't that be great . of course , we never know when things are going to change . any one of us could be transferred to another convent , tomorrow .
what 's going on at owen 's , uncle al ?
maybe i 'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin ' ram , sefelt .
maybe we should give him some water .
gee , um ... i ... i do n't know what to say .
i have to talk to her .
ai ! boom boom aiaiaiaiaee ! alright , that was a little tension breaker , that had to be done , alright ?
why are you doing this ... ? handing out these horrors ! why ... ? ! !

i had it at four .
does he know you think he 's real ?
interesting .
i 'm moving . remember ? what 's with the hooded cloak ?
so ! -- he 's on your side , too .
coffee 's perked .
you better have a pretty good explanation for this , selena .
oh no .
thought you swore you 'd never carry that thing again .
why did n't you tell me about this ?
we 've got our own clock . we 'll lock up .
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe , sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation . but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden . was n't s'posed to , but it did . and it 's back to the law of the jungle . you got your predators and you got your victims .
such pretty knees for a big boy !
i 've decided it 's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat .
just like me .
security , uh norm , norm speaking .
who 's the honcho around here ?
you work too hard , you know that ?
i 've been thinking ... i do n't want you to be my doctor . because i do n't want you to examine me .
how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states ?
yes , sir .
but i still want one .
what needs sorting out ?
did you pick it up from the street ?
from the club . you did n't answer .
you eat first , then you light . once you light , it 's yom kippur , which means you 're fasting , so you ca n't ... eat .
they 'll open one !
you 've never been to a dance , have you ?
no . we keep it in the backyard . of course , in the house . it 's in there .
i 'll tell you , i 've learned one thing : women , like wine , get better with age . of course , i have no frame of reference for this comparison .
are they standing for me ?
any other entrance ?
on his back , i suppose .
well , who the hell you think wants to get in there with you ?
yeah ?
yeah .
why , i am looking at you , miss .
no , i give it to someone else first .
no , sir , please ... she is innocent ...
hope ...
oh , yeah ? maybe she did n't commit suicide . she may have been murdered !
it is . there 's something we need to talk about . something i need to ask you ...
comrade kopalski ...
a dressing bag ?
i do n't care .
i 'm not like you .
thanks .
someone ?
terrance and phillip are two very untalented , unfunny actors from canada . their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage . now it appears they have a movie and i 'm positive it 's not suitable for children !
pardon ?
what gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while sylvia and i wound up at the guggenheim museum .
and no birds sing .
yeah . i ... i fell asleep . i ca n't believe it . i --
stop the damn car .
just ... uh ... you know .
that 's not the point . in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do n't .
i just have to relax a little . not feel so guilty all the time .
i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i bathe -- any requests ?
so what do you think ? should we get a room ?
okay .
no .
he will join us or die , my master .
yeah ... i think i understand ... you 're drunk , too .
i phoned but nobody answered . i wanted to tell you how sorry i am -- and to find out if there was anything i could do .
maybe .
we 're gon na die , and you want me to do some freaky shit like that ? !
mind if i come along for the ride ?
me neither .
jon , this is goddam insane . you ca n't go through with it . what about eve ?
i do n't look at pictures . i look at the < u > real thing < /u > . i do n't feel infected .
you shot melanie ?
well ... yeah .
well , obviously , we got to go back .
oh ... right ! well ... cheers everybody !
because i 'm in love with you .
so what 's the deal , gorgeous ?
yah .
and that 's your minister of science . honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge .
that 's perfect .
just the grub box and bed rolls .
hey , are you hungry ? i 'm hungry .
i 'm not up for running into anybody . let 's just kick it here , alright ?
it 's cici ! cici 's the name of the character she plays in the movie !
yeah , i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me .
trust me , you 're not missing anything .
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable . `` jesse woodson james . '' jesse james ? the jesse james ?
looking to score ?
i do n't understand ...
gee whiz , boss , you know mr. norton told me not to leave him , not even for a minute .
alright . i will not come . provided one thing .
betty , betty , betty ...
too risky . we do n't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car .
a sauciere --
how about the cop ?
what is he ?
i 'm sure you would .
he 's good .
just one , father , but boy was it a doozy .
oh yeah . there 's just one thing i do n't get . `` monkeybone creator awakens from coma '' that 's a big story ! that 's front page news ! but i ca n't find a < u > word < /u > of coverage in this stinkin ' rag ! < i > < /i > hey . do n't i have a tv show ?
there 's a red light on the second intake valve .
maybe .
excellent . bill , find mr. weathers a position to suit his condition .
yeah .
so i did n't fucking do it !
i do n't think anybody wants the drapes , stacy , i think the drapes are okay .
go on , talk big ! i 'll soon have you purring like a kitten .
i do n't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy . you 've been real square dealin ' with me . the bible says two men ort not lay together . but i 'll bet you the good lord would n't send nobody like you to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades . that boy lives inside of his own heart . hits an awful big place . you take care of that boy .
what did i do ?
oh , andy .
lou escobar ? he 's a lieutenant .
tell me ... what do you do with witches ?
come on .
there 's a word - orders .
you must carry spare parts --
sustained . mr. tully , do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case ?
that 's it , it 's go time .
maybe this is n't a good idea .
everything -- my purse , containing upwards of a hundred guineas , my jewels , my snuff-boxes , watches . and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees ...
you really are one dumb asshole .
anyway , when that boy came over , it was the first time you ever did anything without her . and amy wasn抰 just jealous ... she was sad and lonely . she missed you .
a new magazine ! i never saw it before .
that 's better .
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier ... .
sure . we 'll save the formal announcement for when you 're out . i already told your mother . i hope you do n't mind .
then what is he doing ?
all right then we 've got clean rats .
then why do n't you write about something you know ? write about yourself and anne . the poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there 's a swell theme .
the nielson 's ?
he did ? i do n't remember . did he say about me ? in the trunk ?
there 's nothing here .
it 's so ... small .
what is it , alfredo ? right now , of all times !
walk to the window . right in front of you .
you smell like trouble --
all right . this morning --
you wan na know the difference ? the difference is that you 're screwing up the song .
well , that 's the main thing -- do n't you think so ?
i 'm completely stunned . i do n't want this to happen .
i ca n't believe we built this .
well ... is it so urgent ?
it 's all right , violet . it 's working . all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does .
no one would have thought it of me . i 've been getting rusty in fredersdorf . well , if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone . from now on ...
y'what ?
silky an ' faith , they rode off to the east an ' two deputies was followin ' them .
traitor ! she 'll marry you in hell !
hello ?

i do n't have a goddamned idea .
yes it is ... may i introduce you to bern ...
it 's more than that . it could be more than that . i want hunt paid .
yeh ... this foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry !
fifty years , huh .
what ?
come on , el , you 're a trooper . i 'll get you some pepto , you 'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person , then back to sacramento . this is no time to lay down on the job . i do n't care what the polls say , you ca n't afford to relax . look what happened to bush . tell you what , if you want to blow off the sacramento speech , fine . but do this one and we 'll get out of the smog .
make her easy , john . watch her .
the morning after pearl harbor , he drove down to st. louis to reenlist . he was so damn excited . world war ii was going to be his second chance . they told him he was too old ... fat ... nearsighted . said he 'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family .
i do n't understand .
can i look for myself ?
what ?
uh ...
i bought a couple of tickets .
excellent decision . your name is abdullah ? i 'm sure we 'll meet again . go and enjoy the splendid morning .
yes . it will be a book in my honor . for saving your life and nursing you back to health . i 'll be the first one to read it . oh , paul , you 're going to make me the envy of the whole world ...
it 's called tact , you fuckrag .
what have you done with the ring ?
yeah , yeah . it goes `` perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines '' ?
that was a pretty backhanded compliment . if i let people get away with things like that , i would n't be a good salesman .
thank you very much , clarence .
does n't he live here ?
oh , now i 'll never get home !
like a shrink , like if i go to see a shrink , i 'm protected , i can say things -- fuck -- i do n't know what i 'm doing --
just a manner of speaking .
yeah , i 'm going to finish what you started --
oh no . thank you . come on in .
will you relax ? this in no way affects our business . go on .

otherwise you may have to what ?
i do n't know , but i think part of it 's ...
no , they 're for your mom .
come on , do n't fuck around , will ya ?
this is cause for celebration . she 'll probably charge half price for sex from now on .
yes , i do . gim me a chance . i 'm stronger than you think .
if the constitution is ratified ... we 'll have a country . they 'll want to elect you president of the convention , which means president of the country .
ringing my bell ...

i told the lieutenant my late father was general alexander de beauharnais , and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory .
i do n't want a floor plan ; i want to know who ! who 's taking the ticket for this , johnny ?
had he been trying to blackmail you ?
you know how she is .
now look , rita , i do n't make the rules -- you puttin ' yourself on a limb , comin ' here , askin ' me to do a thing like this . and i be damn if i 'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy !
you told him you liked him .

i used to live here .
everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar . and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty .

and she 's all wrong for me !
you think you 're doing these people a favor ? what are they going to do ? either they get on welfare or they become criminals --
he was around ...
i do n't believe that , sir . we抳e shared many disappointing journeys .
it 's not used for anything .
i do n't want you to let go .

if you say so .
that must have made you proud .
no , no jokes , i got ta pee . just tell me about your day . what went on back there ?
great . you look great . you both do .
i just thought you 'd like to know --
of course , but you 've got no reason to think he 's bungled the case ?
pile in .
my mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture . she thinks it抯 --
such a racket i heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars .
do n't turn around now - but there 's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us .
a thousand feet .
itzhak stern ? he 's on the list .

vitamins , exercise , herb tea ... and see a doctor , will ya ?
those are the two categories ...
ben , i 've got a ride home . maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here ?
i know , ma . i 'm a tryin ' . if it was the law they was workin ' with , we could take it . but it *ain't* the law . they 're workin ' away at our spirits . they 're tryin ' to make us cringe an ' crawl . they 're workin ' on our decency .
look , this is a scientific experiment , okay ?
none of this would 've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint , which you did n't .
juliet 's infectious . . . she 'll be going to hospital .

kevin , it was just a --
c'mon , beth -- that report 's like the blind leading the blind .
what 's the plan ?

my teacher told me once there 's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it , even after you 're dead . so that when you die you 're trapped inside your body , watching it corrode for all eternity .
yes , yes , i 'm sure i only did you good , maggie .
i 'm sorry . you 'll do all right without me . keep my share .

only when you breathe ... do n't tell me you 're still working for mrs. mulwray ?
good day , major .
i 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . i have to know who is in my house .
you believe me , right ?
sure , pop . whatever you want .
do n't be too long .
off ... .
you 've certainly thought this out , have n't you ?
always .
you know , louise , you 're supposed to be my best friend . you could at least be a little bit happy for me . you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that is n't completely disgusting .
i like that . a gun to your head and you ask about your partner . he 's okay . may have a headache for a few days . are you here with honorable intentions ?
wait .
you was a golden warrior .
we 're not stealing . we 're borrowing .
you ca n't run --

... until the plan changed , when jessie 's mom gave us these tickets . what , rachel . 'forgot ' i told her ?
who 's this ?
i do n't buy that . there 's a place for hatred . did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed ? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her . do you know what that feels like ?
being here , with me .
you almost had me fooled .
okay , yeah .
jim ... he < u > wants < /u > it .
if i 've got it right , my lord , you lead an invasion into zululand , for i see it all around me , but `` why ? '' is the question my readers will ask . `` why ? ''
that 's very simple . i was home .
who ?
he was n't wearing a ring . but you do n't want to date a cop frida . they 're so blue collar .
i 'm worried about you .
we just thought ...
oh .
what 's it to you ?
ploughman 's lunch . traditional english fare .
what is it ?
lisa -- i ca n't guess what you 're thinking .
[ i want you . ]
i 'm afraid that 's not so , sir .
you 've been talking about the disciples . what color were they ?
give me a break . i checked back into the hospital- amongst other things .
and burn the map and retrieve the key .
barbatus ?
sheriff , how many batteries and what size did you find on < u > defendant 's < /u > boat ?
kill him .
a list .
that you came upon carl by accident . like you said . gave him the battery . like you said . asked him about the seven acres . like you said .
what 's wrong with you ?
all right , five hundred guineas .
talk to my accountant .
well until we see it , we 're not gon na be convincing too many people .
i also place las chocolates on the pillow .
about two years before .
jimmy , what are you doing ?
what about you , kimberly ? did you anyone from flight- ?
ginger called me .
i do n't know . maybe because i love you so much , boss .
ironically , this is not far from the truth . but i 'm getting ahead of myself . can you tell me , neo , why are you here ?
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . is that true ?
and you , dr. cappucino , you 're lucky i do n't hit women , assuming you are a woman . i 'm not taking anything for granted anymore .
here 's the picture of my wife .
during foreplay , i sing the theme song to myself . `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' it 's a real turn on .
go home , pilgrim . there 's nothing you can do . forget this place . start over .
you can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .
you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there .
jeffrey .
they 're fine . as long as they can gripe , they 'll be alright .
mr. keating !
yepper . and vice squad , and meltdown ... whole slew of 'em . i was this close to starting my own little enterprise . but : enter ed dillinger . another software engineer -- not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky . one night , our boy flynn goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file , and ... nothing . a big blank . we now take you to three months later . ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has `` invented '' -- the slime did n't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion . thus begins his meteoric rise to ... what is he now , executive v.p . ?
what medicine ?
can be . not easy , but ?
the cops and company raise hell they find out .
not a holocaust --
i thought so , i noticed your name when you were announced . i 'm corsican too -- my name is arena .

what do i do , dad ?
do we have to talk about this ?
clark . . . wait !
if you 're waiting for `` do you take this man ? `` , that 's considered poor form .
forty yards . less , maybe . i assume it 'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down .
that 's no surprise .
no . mom said if i did , she 'd look up my dad and marry him .
so ?
is that how you answer the phone ?
ah ... no .
why ? you wan na ask me out ?
now , can you stand up ? can you use your legs and stand up ?
guess so .
we 're falling behind .
it 's a fine line between insane and inspired .
you better hold off on the bubbly .
okay . let 's step up the surveillance on her . put on two more guys .
because he was worried about me .
where are you taking us now ?
shut up .
why me ? what about jay ?

i did n't give you away the first time .
mmm .
the creator has not answered .
ruben , my god , i ought to put you on report .
i believe you , austin . let 's go .
what trail are you trying to throw me off now ?
it was the only way to solve certain problems --
i know just where to go .
the navy will get us to within 400 miles of the japanese coast . we 'll launch off the carriers from there .
well that 's that , then . i mean , i was worried about mug shot possibilities already . but now he knows : what you look like , what your first name is , where you 're from and what your specialty is . they ai n't gon na hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out . that 's it right , you did n't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection ?
yeah , it 's a tree . i used to play there all the time . but , you ca n't find it without me . outsider ca n't find no deadwood .
hey , i 'll tell you what -- i 'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket .
nothing . let 's get outa here .
i already do n't like the sound of this .
i 'll need more men to look .
you wan na know ? turn on the t.v . watch the fucking news !
david has suffered a severe trauma . i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor . if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf , why should n't david ? and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf , would n't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon ?
then what are we going through all this trouble for ?
what else is there to do ?
ss'kya'ta ' .
well , i was n't nervous .
you 'll see my grandfather in valhalla !
relax , i 've got mcculloch covered ... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter . rumor has it she 's a teensy bit afraid of the water ...
all i 'm doing is feeling lousy about it . i do n't know what to do . what do i do , kit ?
yes . i understand you 're taking away the remains .
fuck me ...
why could n't you have just dialed me from the office , irwin ?
oh , thank you , sir !
almost three .
you 're a comedian ?
no ! i 'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother !
did n't look that way -- you know -- from a distance .
blessed are the vegetarians .
you may not think so , but you are .
one half bar of chocolate . one bunch of keys on white metal ring . one packet of cigarettes . two plastic ball pens - one black , one red . one pocket comb - black plastic . one address book - imitation red leather . one ten penny piece . one white metal wristlet watch , `` timawrist '' on a white metal expanding bracelet . anything else in your pockets ?
come on , it 'll be fun .
yes ! ! !
good . we 'll seal your promise with ...
umm ... did n't you ever wonder about me ?
what are you lookin ' for ?
yah .
this is great , we got cable .
it 's so beautiful . it 's just what i would have picked out if i 'd had every ring in the world to choose from . you see what i mean . there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises , but i am not one of them . surprises are highly overrated .
jesus christ she got her period . relax guys . it happens .
same old story . not interested .
we still have to go in there sometime .
mr. harris does n't check out until tomorrow .
we do n't want to be disturbed .
a book of delusions . anything else ?

visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage .
i 've heard of you , too . you were in 124 with bargamian .
it 's not a game . something you play .
she denied it . said i was crazy and paranoid .
yeah , sure , what ?
back in the driver 's seat again , doctor ? that old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick . so you can find a cure -- they 'd name it after you ? death is the only cure for people like me .
kay-em we made it !
luthor , i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you 'd be far away from here by now .
a job ?
what about you , delly ?
bullshit . someone 's covering somethin ' . that was no accident .
this is n't in our database ?
how can we end this madness ?
where do i find you ?
so could you write down her exact address ?
... spock ...
you and my mother would have a special connection .
do n't you think i do ?
that 's great .
that feels so great .
you ca n't kill my father that easy . he 'll fight forever . like with me : has n't talked to me in three years . but it 's okay . sometimes you have to put things behind you .
what 's with him - he drinks ?
i 'll give you 10 % of the door if you do n't play .
who is it ?
the ghosts --
that 's never been proven
to be more specific , he was wanted by this agency .
ai n't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years . my boy was taken from me ... far as i 'm concerned , he 's dead . now , i ai n't gon na ask you again . -- who are you ? !
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus , new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i do n't know where you come from , ms. grey , but where i come from , you do n't go melting people 's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -
what for ? who are you ?
okay.. .we 're done , man ... .
boss ! jesus ! they 've --
i need some

living across the street from a grade school . jesus .

... the police report says he was shot three times but the coroner 's report says quite clearly that denzil dowell was shot six times . and two of those shots were in his armpits . brothers and sisters you know why that is ? because denzil had his hands up ! !
yeah . i guess .

but i want the opportunity to believe . i want the choice to believe .
oh --
how do we know this is the right way ?
but it was an accident . the house was under construction .
a waste-basket ? gus those are plans . blueprints .
not so , counsellor . that secretary of yours , she was n't just your secretary , she procured women for you , did n't she ? as many and as often as you wanted .
what shape is the scar ?
what would you like ?
why not .
tell me about her again .
jezebel , from the post office . you remember , you met her that time at the christmas party . i was living with her . god , it was a nightmare . there were all these demons and i was on fire . only i was burning from ice .
i could always apply there .
i 'll be walking out of the bank , unarmed . you 'll have the gun and i 'll drive the car .
i 'm really sorry .
yes , sir ...
that 's ridiculous -- thea 's lovely , gentle ?
i can explain --
i dunno . maybe i do n't deserve to win . i 've done a lot of bad things . i dunno ...
mm .
that 's half a movie , with holes in it . maybe forty minutes of screen time . you do n't even have a girl , a female lead , and on top of that , there 's no one to sympathize with , you do n't have a good guy .
huh . problem is , jack 's idea of a normal life is robbing banks . it 's all he 's ever done .
but do n't you see ? the pen is mightier than the sword .
who the hell are you ?
there 's no one else to talk to . the tattoos were phony !
so i been told .

had to get away for his health , i suppose .
oh ... that 's nothing , someone gave it to me .
i 'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a coke .
it may be , but to my notion , those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later .
oh , them . hell , i seen them .
right .
i ... you told me your name was rudy . you told me a million times , back in the truck , telling me you were n't nick --

if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself .
yeah , well `` cook 's '' is just a made up name . when they originally opened back in 1922 they were named `` the coon chicken inn '' -- that 's an early painting of their first logo .
we know .
let 's go .
i came to see you , you look fine . we got ta go .
this is mole . it 's good .
hi , ben . what are you doing with yourself these days ?

i have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping . this house needs just < u > everything < /u > . i 'll probably be gone all day . jimmy , hurry up and eat or you 'll be late .
no !
i 'm afraid that 's hardly the sort of security i was thinking of -- you see -- there is that promising little fellow , your son ...
what ?
hey . i got another question for you .
he hates doctors . doctors and lawyers . he never goes to doctors .
you know these doctors could have settled out of court . they wanted a trial . they wanted to clear their names .
what do you mean , thank god ?
so go get 'em , dad !
and then it will be too late . the goal of evil is to wipe out life ! all forms of life . for all eternity ... life upsets it .
what 's the decoy ?
what is it ?
is it cold in here ?
i 'll tell you what , toddy . it 's because i ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood . it 's because you were afraid to face it -- and you 're still afraid .
see what i mean ? a question please ... 'is this what you call living ? '
sorry , kid . you got the gift but looks like you 're waiting for something .
it 's junior , is n't it .
well i mean like they also took our fuel -- we 've been here two days .

mr. dowd , i was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation .
well , my wife , ester 's down the hall . i saw barnett leaving and i was just talking to ester about your being here . she loves you so much , i just had to come down and say hello . we 've been following you since you were a girl . well , i just scared you to death . i did n't mean to do that .
what 's that supposed to mean ? !
you can not escape your destiny .
and what will he do ?
and now you must let me be the judge of that !
kirk . they 're gone .
i thought you were supposed to keep them .
me , too . i 'm getting married tomorrow .
are you aware of the pride there is in what you 're saying ?
you sure you do n't know nothing about this ?
i think anything you want to do , you 'll do well .
can you now ? aah ... sheeps ' heads ! you learn more by getting out there and living .
i 'm a labor lawyer . there are < u > always < /u > mob ties .
i 'm just looking at you . does that make you uncomfortable ?
i just wanted to get past this & quot ; old school marm & quot ; image .
man against nature , right travers .
what does he direct besides traffic ?
o.k .
i 'll get my purse .
i 'll pay you a thousand dollars . i have it in my wallet .
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini- rosenberg and court composer salieri .

hi , lady .
eddie ... what 's a dd-5 ?
do n't this place look like home ?
it was all used . random numbers . how can they trace it ?
i done it all . i 've done an ' seen everything ' . believe what i 'm tellin ' ya -- ya shoulda seen the night in brooklyn , i smacked 'ginny ' russo outta the ring , september 14 , 1923 -- same night firpo knocked dempsey outta the ring . but who got the press ? he did . he had a manager -- september 14 , 1923 .
ya looked through it ?
she 's locked safe in her room , no thanks to either of you . has he brought it back on course yet ?
you have n't been still a moment since you 've been here . you act as if you had neurosis --
why do n't you come down to la ? stay with us for a while .
it 's a warning , that 's for sure .
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship . my ... eh ... we kidnapped it . on it there was a map that said how to come to earth . this was very important . before then , we thought we were the only people in all the stars .
i hope it was n't something i did .
[ i know this . your point ? ]
oh yeah . it 's beautiful , beautiful beaches . blue water and clear skies as far as you can see .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i refuse .
have i really taught you everything i have to give ? i do n't think so .
i do n't know .
nearly four years ...
loretta .
now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
ah --
besides , even if i decided to fuck his brains out , what business is that of yours ?
uh-huh .
good ! so maybe he also know where the hell am i going to get the parts i need ...
we both know i 'm already dead .
her 'head ' ? ! you 're making this up ...
look , why do n't you and lila stay here and have your natural life . i 'll just go on my way . you 'll never see me again .
run to the nearest phone and call the police .
but do n't you get money ? from the vatican ?
i do n't want to waste your time .
then i owe you some thanks ...
how 's about it , bart ?
how do you know he 's dead ?
what 's wrong with how i carry myself .
how 's your arm ?
father - may i ask you a question in private ?
how did he know ?
that 's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
what are they ?
not just buy ! you hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough . we give you love and affection , do n't we ?
and so what ?
the commander is an old friend of yours .
you know what i said , though .
the fare is eighteen credits , please .
the weather .

he 'd bring me carnations .
well , as soon as you grow some balls , let me know .
leave her alone !

wait .
when will this happen ?
yeah , you 're all invited over to morgan 's house for a complementary fish sandwhich .
struggling with a pair of germans .
this is fucking crazy . instead of killing us , he sends us on a suicide mission . do you know who frankie flowers is ? he 's a psycho-cokehead- hitman . a faggot . he 's killed fucking who knows how many people . you 'd need half the force to get close to him . and you ca n't get their help because he lives in fucking san diego .
it 's true ... but a first contract , it 's an exception .
just be thankful he was n't dissatisfied with his sex life .
you want me to go against a priest ? get excommunicated ? you think i 'm nuts ?
i 'm assuming you read my deposition .
no --
you smell like baby powder .
what 's that ?
i 'm just giving you the truth . there was a time when william parrish liked the truth .
this is n't important ? the earth is our home .
can you believe that guy ? what a moron .
she did !
what the hell is plan-r ?
you see that ? you wan na be like that ?
i 'm no psychiatrist . but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy , than --
why .
and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly , as heroes .
we toil and labor , we loot and pillage , rape and kill ... and yet ...
i want this to be a marriage based on love , trust and community property . that 's all i 've ever wanted .
do you think he 'll come back ?
i 'd like to know why not . you thought life on earth was meaningless . you despised people . so what did you do ? you ran away .
i would n't know . being that i 'm just the teacher and all .
hello , sir . how are things at the hat store ?
i have been .
i know who you mean . i think about leaving here , but not to find *them* .
makes no difference to me if they 're only on commission . if they do n't make good money , they 're not giving us good representation , and we ca n't afford to have them around . ever supervise salesmen ?
no ! do n't tell me ! i do n't want to know the future ! my knowledge of future events ... your mere presence here ... could have devastating effects on the course of history . and altering history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear . my immediate response is to send you back to your own time .
i got ta hit the library . anatomy . some of us have real majors . you gon na be okay , sid ?
wow !

so here we are !
hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out . heee hee-haaa ... .
i know you do .
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her . what toughened you up ?
well , you look it . you win ?
we 'll be able to start this afternoon . i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery . now , that 'll impress the governor .
what did you think , they come clear up from kansas to fuck us ?
huh ?
got to follow the paper path here .
so i was replaced by mitch ?
all i got ta do is implicate . the feds can do a lot with a good implication . even if you do n't get sparky , i 'll bet you get ten to twenty more . plenty of time to find a nice fella .
yeah . sure . yeah . we 're on it bigtime . lots of leads . you bet .
no ... ... i do n't get this place . they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress . i do n't get it .
what 's the matter with 'em ? why do n't they come ?
she 'd never called me like that before . she sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid . but she never turned up . i called the house but only got the answer machine . when they found her ... she 'd been going the wrong way . not the direction she 'd have gone if she 'd been coming to see me . or coming < u > straight < /u > to see me . who knows . maybe she just wanted to drive .
she 's not here right now .
no , no , no , no . you ca n't take him away now . this is his night . wo n't you introduce us , wolfgang ?
long distance ? i would n't do that to you . i 'd at least talk to you .
hell , i got lot 's of friends .
jesus christ , stanley , you ca n't go to the bathroom now . you have exactly one minute before we 're back on the air , this is not the time to go to the bathroom .
might i enquire after the situation , sir , given that i 've seen of the french engineering from the ridge above ?
you 're out in the desert , the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles , and you say the time was n't right ? what 's the matter ? you were hoping to get it on home video ? a keepsake for the grandkids . thank god i waited , or i never would have gotten it on tape .
`` g.i . jane . '' and which one of you told me she would n't last a week ? huh ?
a runner gave it to me .
uh , no .

we like you , leon -- do n't we like leon ?
thank you , miss johnson .

uh-huh . some beat , huh ?
i had gotten their trust . we were sharing fantasies . i could n't risk it .
we can still see each other . just like always . it 's a different kind of sin . smaller .
we do n't have to always go to your club , dad .
dennis and mars are in the den . i 'll get your brother , then come back for you . we 'll go down the stairs and out the front door , you understand ?
where are you going ?
oh god !
i beg your pardon .
yeah ... so that 's him . and you 're not crazy .
it is quite late enough .
i do n't believe i 've seen you at any of our services before .
i do n't remember any arbor day cards from mr. rock 'n ' roll detective .

i ca n't let you do that either .
no -- i guess not .
i did n't know what to do - but i knew i had something somebody would want . that 's where i met him - told him what i had . the fbi set me up with a new place ... but the cops found me somehow . so i ran ... and met you .
how about roxy ? is she a fuck to the century , too ?
yes . we won , that 's right .
not at all .
right , right , what am i thinking of ?
i 'll tell you what i 'm blathering about ! i got information -- new shit has come to light and -- shit , man ! she kidnapped herself !

nope . she did . like i say . it never panned .
i was on call .
he will know everything about you . everything . i know , because i 've done it . once you 've been inside a mark 's home , you 're in their head . if you 're any good , you 'll find the mark in a week , and bain is good because i was the best and i could n't take him .
i 'm sorry .
what , working security ?
oh , paul , you ca n't have your own way ! ! !
i 'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night .

you always were a son-of-a-bitch , were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
you had immense plans ... immense plans ...
you told them . you said i arrived on a camel , shot you four times . left you for dead .
and if we fail , and lose our carriers , we destroy our ability to fight them at all . as soon as the second wave returns , we will withdraw .
i just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug . what chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you , 'it 's okay , just chuck it ' ?
karen , say hello to chili palmer . chili , this is karen flores .
she 's too genuine .
he wanted to ride back down with you . now sit and relax , get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
not me . no way .
i 'll come to you tonight .
here we are , harold . oat straw tea and ginger pie .
ahhh ... why ?
the red blood cells are biconvex , which is theoretically impossible . they 're hypochromic , there 's virtually no hemoglobin in them . look at the pmns , they 're binucleated , they should be mononucleated .
go start picking up the pieces . we 'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner .
you drink rum ?
that 's clear .
i want to speak to marc shermin .
mommy i 'll get bigger and bigger every day and then i 'll pop but ... but if i stay little it wo n't happen .
indeed ... if we could get back to the business at hand . it 's one thing to have a warhead , it 's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it .
nice to be here .
yeah , maybe i 'm not . but we are , you asshole .
how 's that for fucking savoir fair !
he tries to do everything ...
yes , mine . i 'm going to have one .
abbott wants to talk .
new baby ?
run that sandefur piece on `` nicotine 's not addictive . '' run that on-camera . then cut right to wigand with `` i believe they perjured ... '' then go wide to the ceos all taking the oath . back on jeff and play the pause after the word `` felt '' on the b-side ...
after the kids are back in school .
yeah . you gave up your hot tub tape to save me . that 's real progress for you .
let 's not jump to conclusions , we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap .
i was just looking at you -- so quiet .
my lord dunois ... i have wonderful news ! -- finally -- he 's sending her to us -- thanks be to god -- we 're saved -- it 's wonderful !
i came for the wedding .

'cardiff giant . ' that 's us .
you bastard ! i need a lawyer immediately !
popup , on floorboards . and --
does anybody live to make a second ?
smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator . the statue , however , was hollow --
i have to .
afraid not .
whatever you say , sir .
hi , dad .
i am not talking to you , bitch .
it 's not possible ...
you 'll have me , after all i 've done to you ?
well , see , there 's a minimum charge of four dollars . long-term parking charges by the day .
must be . and if it is -- it 's a part of him not even he can control .
i tried to clear things up , professor scott . i explained you 'd come all the way from edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at plexico , but they do n't seem to know anything about it .
it 's touching me .
we accidently traded vox units when we bumped into each other on saturday .
above lord wessex ?

chili and me .
i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt . moriah , and we still live in terror ... .
delmar what the hell are you talking about ? - we got bigger fish to fry-
we should have just ignored him .
yes .
how about some candy floss ?
conscious ? cas soll ich auch noch wissen ?
somewhere .
so we 'll put a warning on the label .
ah-ha .
why did n't you tell bree , afterwards ?
-- an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of intimidation . i know that .
i know . that 's why i 'm asking .
when it does , morpheus will tell them anything they want to know .
yeah , and a lot easier to get to than that island .
ai n't skated since i was fifteen -- that 's when i started fightin ' -- got ta watch the ankles . yeah , fightin ' use to be tops with me , but no more . all i wanted to prove was i were n't no bum -- that i had the stuff to make a good pro .
a what kind of doctor ?
-- we call them `` vactors '' .
you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball .
somebody could n't wait until dark .
i deserve better than this .
i 'm already in your bed .
here 's one !
a court < u > order < /u > is gon na say that < u > woman < /u > is < u > never < /u > < u > alone < /u > with my children ! ever < u > again < /u > ! do you hear that ?

yeah , a long one .
well , come on , that 's half a dozen armed men ...
he 's dragged me into every gin mill on the block .
i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time ?
you ready to keep winning ?
yes . and so is birth . now look me in the eyes , nuke -- you have n't been wearing my panties , have you ?
the book said they have boats that are like taxis ... vaporettos . what 's the name of the place we 're staying again ?
do n't i know it .
yeah .
so what ? what did it get me ? i 'm wearing a cardboard belt .
this is not a joke . thank god victoria does n't know . it would really have hurt her feelings .
how long has he been having problems ?
... would you excuse me , please ...
ok. well . i 'm gon na go out of town . i 'm going to go out of town just for two days ...
when it comes to women , you 're a true democrat .
jim , maybe we should just go . i 've got to look in on the kids . paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city .
so what ? everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin ' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner . i 'm fuckin ' sick of it .
i.do n't get it . you 're going to help me ?
why did he come back ?
maura .
never ?
you 're telling me , but only because you never let me in on any of it ... you 're not going to see bobby , are you ?
... `` the beast . '' a nineteen-year-old kid . she understands the nature of `` the beast . '' she called it a wild animal .
but the center of the galaxy ca n't be reached . no ship has ever gone into the great barrier . no probe has ever returned .
want to see my trick shot ? it 's even better .
you were n't really interested in suez at all . incredibly enough , you were interested in my wife .
yes . i 'm interested in financing an adult feature film . i was told you were the man to come to .
i got ta take some money out , that 's what for .
we invested in these factories . in vancouver .
barrett . dana barrett .
i do n't understand you . it is a fine match with hockley , and it will insure our survival .
as of three o'clock this afternoon . i submitted my resignation .
she is upstairs .
made it to week 10 last time .
this here 's a strike .
no ... .
maybe i will .
and billy told you that he 'll tell that to ...
he 's cutting our throat ...
where are you going ?
there 's no joy in it for me .
and likewise .
sure it was n't . hey , anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies ? do n't raise your hands all at once .
i had a feeling you would . touche !
the dogs have lost the scent , mr. pendergast . maybe we should head back .
george , i am happy to see you . how are you , my brother ?
what 's it look like ? we 're going in .
yeah , just like a half hour , maybe a little more , and your mom 'll give it to you . you can wait a half hour , ca n't you ?
i know , father .
what about which girlfriend ?
you 're darkening the picture , are n't you ?
hesh up ! be still now ! drown 'em ! drown 'em ! drown ?
let me talk to him . hold the phone to my ear -- but do n't nudge me .
do you like being a cop , bud ?
no .
how ?
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable .
datura ! miguel knew it ! datura , he was shouting ! datura metel !
what ?
that 's right .
you always know the right thing to say .
you never heard of snake plissken ?
funny ?
easy , billy , just open it .
it 's personal . has he been out long ?
i really don抰 like that comparison , honey .
i think she 's the alien . in any case , she 's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room .
all in good time , mister mcmurphy . all in good time .
and the fact that there were n't any lights made it so ... god ! that was so great !
i know . i 'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . if you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . and bring the sheila 3.2 character module with you ...
d.k . -- did n't know -- who i was when the options he bought took a bath . he reneged on me .
i 'd like you to switch to the day shift , mike . to be home for dinner . helen insists that t.j. be home for dinner ... that 's why he 's on the morning shift .
you 're really into god , right ?
oh-oh .
lots of hair ... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out .
i 'll be there in 5 minutes .
'it got us in hot water ... we should have been there for carla ... . '
what ? you know him ?
wo n't you join us ?
i ... i 'm very sorry , but i never open . i 'm very sorry but i never open the door to strangers after dark .
come on frida , i 'm not kidding . i 'm totally fucked . let me in .
as i said , sir , we 've got all the people we need .
they 're just insurance in case we run .
i ... i am . mitch , is ... mitch , this is n't usual , is it ? the gull yesterday when i was in the boat , and the one last night at annie 's , and now ...
that 's okay . it does n't make you a bad person .
i 'll say .
where is he ? .
oh , good heavens , no !
i told you , i do n't know .
you not ugly .
so push it !
i 'll have him call the moment i hear from him .
my pleasure , sir .
no . you listen . i had my doubts about you from the beginning
even if it offended someone , i would n't eat a fish eye .
this is serious ! i do n't have my license . he was my ride .
and back at ya . only there 's a part of you that 's ... i do n't know --
those blue things ate everybody here ?
that what he says . right ?
was this him ?
just a minute .
he is very good .
thief , i think , is more accurate .
no !
stay clean .
what are we going to do ! ?
really ? you 'd do that for me ?
what do you know about it ? ! ... listen , the ghost is too powerful . the only chance we have is to use this machine . i need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs .
no ? what do i act like ?
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association . the world is a hologram , albert .
no .
where are you going ?
i always thought there was something wrong with him . heh heh heh .
you remember mr. longdale , do n't you ?
no shit ? ! ? ! you know him ?
sooner , the better .
we could make a start on the floor afterwards .
the access code to your mainframe .
oh , my !
is it here ? now ? in this room ?
-- let me do this , okay ? --
that 's just it , charlie . that 's what i 'm driving at . you could do anything in that time .
in every exhibition room . the museum 's divided into five cells . the reception and exhibit are in cell five . we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four , then seal the perimeter with our fire doors .
who told you that ?
bleeker told me katrina 's whole house reeks of soup !
there was no visible wound ?
yeah . you met him once .
ya hear me ? you bust that crapper and i 'll beat your ass .
be careful !
yes , sir -- i learn to write a little bit , and i can read a lot --
it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father . or , did you think this , between us , was friendship ? just because you went fishing with my father , i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away ?
hey cy , guess who 's here ?
after dropping a bombshell like that , you owe me . big .
hey , you 're anti-male .
ya know , those things to get attention , like saying that her bed shakes and stuff .
they will serve salad .
lady , by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops --
yes ...
so all by yourself , you 're going to destroy every government ; in the world .
tonight .
mr. mcquire .
well , that 's exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi .
sang ? his name is a past tense ?
no .
hey , check it .
hi ... am i late ?
when we get artoo 's message to them , you think they 'll try to rescue the princess ?
we do n't know for sure ...
hey , fuck you man , you were n't there , we were . and i 'm tellin ' ya , the cops had that store staked out .
they 've been coming in steady all morning . i have called for some extra police .
tell the court about that , please .
that 's not what you said . you said if you did n't have a winning record --
where is he now ?
means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we did n't at least try to .
reggie -- why wo n't you listen ?
if he 's really a bully , he wo n't cop to it , anyway .
i 'm sorry - i did n't think
it 's too perilous .
what were you doing there ?
sorry . what ?
reef !
i do n't think so .
back where ?
commissioner .
it 's a free country , is n't it ? as long as i 'm not trespassing on your property . i can stay here till kingdom come .
you drive ! i think there 's something wrong with me .
is it gassed up ?
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to . other than that , there 's never any reason .
my help ?
what kind of test ?
hurts . hurts pretty bad .
they wo n't hurt you , darling . mother 's with you ! mother 's looking after you !
i 'll try , d-d-dammit ! you ca n't ask any more than that !
i 'm going to put them on the cat .
what 's she doing ?
so what happened to the barbecues , and fishing ?
everyone seems so --
i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea .
i know . you 're too strong , beth .
what does it mean ... climb down to the horseman 's soulless place ?
who is he ?
i beg your pardon , i 'm not an asshole . i 'm an actor .
why ? it 's such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .
of course not ! no one has the time to read ! one glances at things , watches television ...
he 's dead , lara .
which guy in toledo are you talking about ?
could be worse . they could have found it in your eye .
you can send somebody with me if you do n't believe me !
who the hell ever is . this is the most protected shipment we 've got -- and the most useless . these bills are n't even < u > in < /u > circulation ; the one thousand dollar bills we 're transporting are only used for international banking exchange .
they 're a bit too real for my taste . will you excuse me for a moment ?
you have n't mentioned dating anyone since mark and , well you 're not a lesbian are you ?
he has his uses too .
do you know a clarence worley ?
i think ... i might be ill ...
how you doin ' plissken ? you like the watch ?
- any more than being the son of captain neilsen does !
uh-huh . and when we get there , we 'll be able to find a way to transport you ... home .
why do n't you return this car and borrow mine ? have debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back .
you have n't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there ?
one of mine . and it was n't a standard hit .
sure i know where he lives . he lives in bailey park .
i did n't .
you 're playing games .
you showed up warner in class ? you 're supposed to be showing up sarah .
i accept .
i think so .
really . how wonderful for you .
well , she 's not local . her ears are pierced three times each , and she 's wearing green glitter nail polish . looks like town to me ...
how are you ?
... it has many traits of deep sea marine life ... regeneration , scales , gills , even a period of dormancy ... but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored , or where the communication wiring was , may imply that it has some other quality ...
we 're not confused .
it 's not really important .
they 're just leftovers .
good idea of yours to come out here , harold . it 's a lovely spot .
just follow me .
so i put some of the money into legitimate deals with charlie clark . he was ace 's banker .
now , lisa --
arbogast .
put it down !
promise me ... .
you think i have n't been trying ! it 's like there was never anything there . just water .
as surely as if it were my own ! harry , give me back the enterprise ! with scotty 's help ...
my thanks .
hah .
thanks for clarifying that .
and as far as hiding a body goes ? i find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim 's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess . it 's absolutely preposterous . now i 'm not saying i do n't believe you , i 'm ... .ambiguous . there 's quite alot of money behind all this .
what about obsessively picking her split ends ?
pull out , goddamnit !
okay , now , you guys all take care , okay ? oh , man , i feel so good . i feel good 'cause i 'm hanging out with you guys , man . you know ? i mean , i forgot what it was like to just hang out .
fine .
there 's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars : the ones that ca n't afford new ones , and the ones who would n't give 'em up for anything in the world . that second bunch do n't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents .
let 's go .
surprise .
uh , yes i am . and you are ?
and ?
that 's funny , i was just wondering what i was gon na break of yours to get it away from you .
gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping .
will senator smith yield to his colleague ?
what 's gon na happen ?
we 're down to a `` couple '' now , huh ?
wait .
then the thighs where they joined the torso .
jesus , val , it 's pretty far .
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
this is no good .
let me see the map .
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them . they could n't tell in the dark .
do you like it , being pregnant ?
i do n't use my wife for business purposes , mr. burns !
yeah . maybe .
well i was right . you are a sentimentalist .
perfectly .
i find it convenient to keep my interests ... mobile . anyway , i 've had my fill of life on the ground . after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children ... i find i 've had quite enough of planet earth .
do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster ?
addison ...
let me put it on a level you can understand . you do n't belong here . you do n't know anything about this world . you do n't know the customs , you do n't know how to talk , how to act -- you do n't even look like you belong here . and if you walked out on the street , you would n't get 100 yards without being arrested . then there would be questions , and where would we come up with the answers ?
to < u > show < /u > ... in my ability to < u > squander < /u > . what one might deem an < u > advantage < /u > ... that my < u > strength < /u > is greater than < u > yours < /u > ...
what are you people talking about ?
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door , i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches .
actually , bud 's only tough on the outside .
i believe it was arranged by marshals mortier and marmont . i must explain to you that we have had no orders all day . each marshal has been keeping his own position .
norman .
i think . anyway , i 've tried all their colors . more than once . i 'm getting too old for this . but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality . i apply my personality in a paste . you ?
my goodness , do n't you open your presents until christmas morning ?
it 's flooding like a son of the bitch .
it 's a death mask . death mask means dead .
my favorite doctor . what 's the verdict ?
i do n't know , i never met your father .
i got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me .
who were they ?
oh dear , i did n't really mean to ...
okay , but i 'm worried about the next pms bout . it 's gotten worse . i 'm not myself during it . i get bloated , irritable , my breasts get huge , my nails turn into claws , my teeth get sharper and i have more facial and body hair .
jed is having a slumber party new year 's eve and he invited me .
the girl , lestat -
they do in chinatown .
how about ... zbiegnew speizak 's `` the purple bread , '' an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a polish bakery . in subtitles .

you have done nothing wrong conor macleod .
different mothers , huh ?
thank god . harold crawl home .

i spend three hours a day practicing . i have trainers , i know what i 'm doing .

you think you can use me to stop the meltdown .
holy shit ...
well then , i must be off . we shall have to meet again .
has anyone checked the coring room ?
sir , with all due respect ... .
how much ?
i 'm talking to the spirit of jethro macdonald . is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson ? we 'll be careful of the bed --
yeah . oh , and they messed up your kitchen pretty good , too ... goodnight .
you know , i 've been thinking . i could teach lydia to sew .
my american express ... my bloomingdale 's credit card ... my check book --
disappointing . it only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum , and ... ah ... they 're not very happy and ... well , the guys have decided they want to ... ah , re-think the entire concept and ... look , i do n't like having to do this , okay ? ... but ... i mean , what i mean is ... ah , i 'm going to have to ... ah , let you go --
like this .
what what 's about ?
oh , hi .

that 's what i later told myself ! no , tony , forget leon ! it ca n't be him , he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter !
ca n't stay , i 'm just here because my wife ... ..
november 1 , thirty days have september , april , june , and november ... when short february 's done , all the rest have thirty-one . october 31st ! halloween ! do n't you get it ? orson welles !
they抎 never let me go . and you抎 end up in more trouble than you know for helping me .
seating problems .
i could n't plead insanity , because you see i 'm just as sane as anybody else .
i told 'em not to touch the alarm . they touched it . i blew 'em full of holes . if they had n't done what i told 'em not it , they 'd still be alive .
you 've really got to go .
i got ta say this cake tastes a little funny .
oh , do n't use her like that , for a smoke screen .

oh , okay . so ... how are you feeling ?
i think that 's it .

movin ' in 's mighty thirsty work . i usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner . come on over and join me , if you want .
it was an experience . metal scalpels ... needle and thread ...
i 'd like to bomb their emperor too . but i think that 'd just piss 'em off . the idea here , gentlemen , is not revenge . we 're here to prove to them that they 're neither invincible nor superior . so let 's try this again . military targets only .
happy birthday .
he might just wait us out .
trip ? ?
i 'll do the same for you sometime .
i got the good chocolate , alvy .
i stand corrected mr. decker . navigator , lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center ; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there ...

we could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow .
a handshake , or you know , someone pats you on your back through clothes . doctors , people who have to touch you . but not by people who want to .
answer the question , shitball .
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar . i just did n't know why .
oh yeah .
oh , really ?

i do n't think that 's necessary .
zira , are you mad ?

he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time .
you used to like to touch me -- to make love to me .
you 've been recommended by the management here . they know your father . he has a bit of a reputation , has n't he ?
we must do this sacred thing , mary robert .
anger , fear , aggression ! the dark side of the force are they . easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight . beware , beware , beware of them . a heavy price is paid for the power they bring .
what do you mean ? you 're where right now ?
no , no ...
nor have you !
it would be a terrible scandal , would n't it ?
no one 's trying to buy you , willie . it 's important to know why you 're telling us this .
a bird of prey canna fire when she 's cloaked !
we 're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
who are you protecting , then ?
would you mind ?
is this what you want ? you ask me for this after all i 've told you ?
at the trial , you said you were at your apartment that night . alone .
and you , keitel blacksmith .
no . in the morning .
relax , jameson . this is business . i know you want photos of me , so i 'll give your boy parker an exclusive . on one condition --
it 's none of your business !
you said --
see ?
oh ... really ?
i 'm sorry he got those birds .
why should this be any different ? besides , i have to initiate nick into the family .
you tell me .
of course , your line of work 's only as good as the people you find .
which , wait a second , which is not until the check is cashed .
all i 'm saying is dock with space lab , couple of hours no more . let them take a look at our friends .
that 'll be the day .
to jonas . i did n't know that at the time . did n't know who he was . but i knew inside , whoever he was , he 'd send someone else . so i started watching your father . i wanted to keep him safe .
we want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed .
what are you trying to say ?
decompression would n't do that .
who pays the rent on time .
pearl 's junk . mom gets mad when she plays out here and do n't clean up afterward .
i want you to know we 're going to do everything , in our power to get you out as soon as possible . believe me .
yeah . like you did with takagi .
then it 's still no .
she tarried around the kitchen after i 'd gone up , and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong ...
that son of a bitch .
what about you , manuel ?
you were planning to send me back to the ice house . you set me up .
who 's conducting ?
i 'm afraid you will have to move room .
yes 棗 yes , if she made that much impression on you , i 'm sure it was jacqueline .
-- his left jacket pocket .
why do n't you go ? you should sleep .
why do n't you cut the cute act , danny , and tell me exactly what it is you 're looking for ?
sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .
would you talk to her ? she 's got it in her head that the shark came for him . she still blames it for my father 's death ... .
here he comes .
not quite . she was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on .
shit . you should have been married to someone by now . you know , settled down somewhere with a kid or two , a nice steady job .
look on the bright side , hon . shep here thinks i 'll be a one termer .
dead ? no . i just hurt my back . i 'm not dead .
no one 's gon na win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian . they assembled him at o.c.s . out of spare body parts from dead g.i. 's . i know this for a fact .
where 's my father ? have you even looked ?
with one of them .
thas ' it , thas ' it ... conquer that bitch . what time 're they coming ?
i appreciate you telling me .
on a more fortuitous occasion , perhaps
okay , let me have this .
i do n't see anything .
we 'll tell them what 's happened . they 'll listen to reason , wo n't they -- ?
deef 'n dumb . somethin ' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we do n't see nothin ' . you know what i mean . no matter how much we hate the torpedoes we do n't rat .

are you annie ?
six years . ever since ted and joanna moved into the building .
what kind of research ?
do n't thank me .
what the hell 's that -- ?
and she thinks you 're blackmailing me ?
based on what we had , i thought sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he 's this mob relic , running the show out west .
stop that dog !
i 'm asking for real now -- will you help the secret service ?
in conclusion ... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious , because ... once a nerve fibber is severed ... there is no way to regenerate life back into it . are there any more questions before we leave ?
now i 'd like to be alone .
yes , sir .
yeah ! somewhere in wales . i don抰 really know her . used to turn up in a transit van on weekends , sell old furniture at camden . that抯 how come he only laid her at weekends , ha ha ...
it 's jus ' till we get some distance . then you can come out .
yes .
federal bureau of investigation , special agent chet desmond . i 'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks . jack said you knew her . how well ?
and you told your nephew about it ?
well , but see , i do n't have 'em in front a me - why do n't i just fax you over a copy -
that 's right .

my friend monsieur philipe is a friend of florentino .
sue lefferts died at the nite owl . i 'm investigating .
i 'm glad i did n't have to kill you . i 'm glad it did n't come to that .
junior .
okay , karla , five seconds . five ... four ...
do n't let him kid you . cagney could n't have pulled a sweeter job . all right , boys . we were waiting in the depot in frankfurt , see ? and there was an ammunition train coming through , the longest ammunition train you ever saw , see ? so dunbar gets himself in the men 's room , see ? fixes himself a time bomb , busts open the window and just as the train moves out , lays the thing in there , see ? so then , he comes out like nothing 's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom ! broke every window in frankfurt . it was gorgeous !
i came for grace .
you think she 's sailing without a crew ?
kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place . you people knew this ship was n't ready to fly . you played god with over a hundred lives , kruger , and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program .
here it is . < u > conspiracy theory < /u > it just went out tuesday . third issue this year . i bet i struck a nerve . pissed someone off .
that ca n't be , i have all the classic symptoms .
oh , you 've been thinking . and ?
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you .
how long you been at it ?
that 's a lie . diana would never talk to you about jessica . not after what you did to her .
yo ' yellow , old man .
dentonvale ... say , that 's for ... i 'm sorry to hear that , janet . look i 'm going to let you through , but keep it to yourself , otherwise ...
it does n't make sense to me .
excuse me , would you mind telling me what the hell i 'm doing here ?
are you asking me to marry you ?
i was just leaning on it ! it was an accident !
your aunt ?
now use it .
he 's threatened to do it , it 's been building up in him for months .
oh , i 'll bet you have .
not yet . but the way things going , that boy gon na turn her out any day .
did n't you see it ? he lifted me up and crashed me down .
ooh ooh , tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package . does this mean you 're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ? because , darien , if you 're through with me , you 're through with everything i 'm a part of .
thank you , your honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana , u.s. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code : 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' and , your honor , having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the xerox form .
for a butt-head ? yes .
when ... when will she be back ?
why is that ?
you 're gon na be there ! we 're getting outta here ! take it !
i got a new car . only it 's red . did you know mama died ?
not mine , stupid . yours .
i 'm just an investigator , bill . i leave the theories to you lawyers .
the young girl . who pulled her ?
i 'm going to paris .
so ... the university of kentucky . who runs the program down there ?
you 're a very good boy to respond that way .
do you know who arturo toscanini is ?
there .
i might have an idea ...
he 's great . come on , let 's blow before lo ' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast .
i 'll beat your ass --
twenty large ? that 's all ?
check it out !
you think i manifested the snakes ?
well what is it !
dude , please ! . . . is this your homework , larry ?
curious ... very curious ... .
mr. thacker 's from 'horse and hound . '
so .
now , please , ninotchka , do n't start figuring it out in cows .
mr. hardy , i joined the army for college money . i did n't ask for any of this -- i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed . you say finding those bodies 'll help me , then go find them . i do n't want to die .
kirsty cotton . yes . but ... if your soul was freed , why are you back ?
come in , come in .
you go first . i 'll be right below you .
driver !
that 's very wise .
ugly ... a couple of thousand years they 've been bound by these little rules . looking in . always afraid . ugly little lives ...
i seem to recognize this routine . first the kiss then the touch . oh , what 's the use . you 're you .
taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this . remember that men all look alike to most apes .
she did n't call anyone ? even locally ?
nothing .
portraits . the brigadier , the brigadier 's wife , the brigadier 's dogs , the brigadier at the pyramids , the brigadier breathing .
yeah .
`` soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer , thus banished from thy presence with reproach , and fettered by thy rigorous command , not to appear again before thy beautiful face . deign princess , to remember this thy faithful slave , who now endures such misery for love of thee '' ... .
i did n't tell you to replace any gasket .
the chairs .
i ...
and then you pull that shit this morning , freaking out because i 've gone down on a couple guys !
i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut --
do n't say that word .
sustained . yes . the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records .
well , maybe i would n't lie ... but i could tell the story the way i did just now , so that people could understand that john is even more of a hero , and that you ... you 're the lowest thing that ever crawled . your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail . you wo n't get a cent .
did i ? i do n't know . maybe i should n't have gone out on that line . maybe i panicked .
i 've never loved any one before , gregory , and i do love you - ? you must know it -- but jacqueline 's my sister 棗 whom i had lost and have found again ... .
all padding . do n't let it fool you .
and who is ted nelson ?
you do n't like that you do n't know how to play him . he does n't follow the same rules of politics you do . that makes him dangerous .
remember -- we ca n't take more than five minutes to get out .
his spiritual mother ...
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature .
you mean when are you going to egypt ?
6 ... 5 ...
i did , too . she told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did .
i noticed you were having some problems , blue five ... i thought i 'd help .
no , ken . i need to see him now ...
that the universe will unfold as it should .
and when he walks with a lady , he waits for her !
hmmm ...
but you always let me ... .
because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how america does n't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny tv celebrity because that would just mean that i 'm not really talented .
-- i do n't trust anybody , not even me , anymore --
what are they ?
stop it .
really ? just biding your time , then ? toying with me . is that it ? letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in ?
mr. jung , you 're a convicted felon , correct ?
all right if i look around your lobby ?
maybe you need a closer look .
none too discreet , is he ?
that 's right . he and i , along with seven or eight others . listen , gentlemen , i will be happy to assist you in any way i can -- unfortunately , at the moment , i 'm overdue at another function .
dick has run away . they have taken dr. meridian . and i 'm afraid they found the cave , sir . it 's been destroyed .
yes , i 'm sure it is . that 's what they say , anyway .
what ... ?
hi .
who 's fighting ? why are you so defensive ?
i think he 's going to come for me . not just because i know who he is , but because i hurt him . only i do n't think he 'll try again as lowe .
damnit , yllo ! i do n't like it .
times square .
alexander ... listen to me , it was wrong to bring you . you 're not going to find what you 're looking for .
`` and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms ... ''
kitchen 's through on your left .
... easy , easy , easy .
do you owe markers ?
yes . i do now . now that i 'm telling it .
i 'm telling you i am , joe .
i could n't have slept tonight anyhow .
now , you should n't run yourself down . my employer , mr. lindgren --
kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in chechnya , they called him the `` finger of god '' . assassination and weapons .
do you believe that ?
where did they get those outfits from ? have n't we got some like that , tom ?
cut the bullshit . what do you want , claude ?
but seem to have gotten lost on the way .
that 's right . the answers were there all along , of course , scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind . waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them . my elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales . but i knew better . imagine my surprise when blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free .
julius !
give it back nicholas !
i do n't understand . track 2 's chile ?
i 've never had a pedicure before .
and what was that ?
so that was my part ? smile and shake my ass ?
are you by nature a sadistic person ?
of course i 'm scared .
and he 's never tried to get in touch with his son ?
whewwww ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !
what ? why ?
it 's not for me to decide .
how 'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that ?
did i kill a guy named benito ?
kyra , this is monica . she , uh ...
does this look familiar to you ?
lucky for you , you got him in both of his ... well , what we loosely refer to as ... hearts .
thanks .
is this the key to the attic ?
yeah , they could be songs .
i was in luh-love with her .
yes . when i tell you .
wait .
well ... okay ... but only as a friend .
how about gerald lambeau ? ever heard of him ?
in your other hand .
i do n't trust anybody and i trusted you !
chet wo n't know anything . we 'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it 's over .
try again between the static and 'hey jude ' ; that 's where they 're hiding .
richie , it 's gon na get a lot fuckin ' worse before it gets any fuckin ' better . we showed our ass in texas . we killed texas fuckin ' rangers . they ai n't gon na stop lookin ' till they find us , and when they find us , they 're gon na kill us . texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers . the el paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us .
where are the deflector relays ?
and there ?
yeah , but the untouchables took down capone . heller got shot and killed . the bad guys beat him . worse , sparazza walked .
oh , hey , how ya doin ' ?
... if i was n't such a fucking coward . it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do .
she 's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there .
nooooo ! ! !
there 's a new potion -- he said it was perfected .

`` mistake '' ? what 's that supposed to ... ?
you did n't answer my question . are you saying my word is of no value to you ?
who 's there ?
it was nothing ... i was assuring mr. lingk ...
if you ever touch my minivan again , i 'll make you sorry . real sorry .
who , me ? why , i 'm not a witch at all . i 'm dorothy gale from kansas .
i got drunk .
negative , no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard .
right .
and where am i gon na be ?
tell me .
we 're going ashore . tie her up -- and leave your guns up , lance .
would n't have known you .
yes .
it 's all right . it 's all right , anne . i can take a hint . a bit subtle , but i get it . it 's all right .
i 'll go even further and say that her presence here -- i do n't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance .
yeah . she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch , which is why i said yes to this move . but , whenever it 's just the two of us , i do n't know ... anyway ... what 's happening with the delco lawsuit ?
a long time ago , i was sent far away . when they let me come back , all my friends were gone .
that 's all you have to say ?
on two lane blacktop . mile marker six-one . how we doin ' on time ?

hand rolled .
like you got rid of snorri !
nothing . i said nothing .
tired ...
i love her , bill . she is all that i ever wanted , and i 've never wanted for anything because i 've never wanted anything before , if you can understand .
all his victims are women ... his obsession is women , he lives to hunt women . but not one women is hunting him - except me . i can walk in a woman 's room and know three times as much about her as a man would . i have to go to belvedere .
i 've gone this far , and right now i think i 'm in better shape than you .
i 'm sorry , man .
it 's better , mary sue .
right , that 's right .

but then he had to cover up , make her seem just like all the rest of them . that 's what lecter was hinting !
yes ...
i could n't rest ? i could n't sleep . all i could see was teresa delgado 's body -- broken -- mangled . i saw it day and night . it was waiting everywhere i turned .
next time we 'll bring more blankets .
does he know how to activate it ?
you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt . and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog .
i know a lot of songs about pirates , but none i 'd teach a child . let 's hear it .
are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ?
oh -- god -- oh --
hey !

i 'm sorry , bruce , i just ca n't seem to get a handle on this conversation .
y'know something , baby ? if you were my sister ? i 'd still want to wake up christmas morning with you ...
who are you ?

as long as you 're okay .
she 's fuckin ' crazy , she killed the kid ! she just killed her own kid !
what was that all about ?
did you know my mother died recently ?
yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the delta .
well , it 's not supposed to be done anyway .

truth 'll set you free . i 'm listening .
well , sir , this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majesty 's closet , and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy . i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the viscounty which you propose to get .
the blood transfusion is now in progress . the only words are curt orders like : 'now ! - quickly ! - that 's enough ! - give it to me ! - sit still ! ' etc .

they set a trap they actually set a trap .
they 'll probably believe you . but they 'll want to know what you were fighting about . why mitchell had a gun . you 'll tell them a simple story . they 'll pretend it sounds all right to them . now you 're headquarters . how does it sound to you ?
that would be wonderful , but it 's only been a year since andrew died .
very good , chief . chief guard turns to alex .
yeah .
jane , i have to talk to you .

i 'm a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i 'm trapped in his easy payment plan .
if it wo n't work , it 's beyond my power to fix it . but if it does , there 's no telling how long it will hold up . it 's a jury rig , at best , and we 'll need every second of use we can get out of it . that 's why i do n't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests .

let me tell you about hatchet harry . once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry . it was rumoured that he was on the take . harry invited smithy round for an explanation . smithy did n't do a very good job . within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand , which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock . he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this ; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . hence , hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe .

there 's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared , jasper , virginia . telling the truth can be a scary thing . it scared president kennedy , but he was a brave man . if you let yourself be too scared , then you let the bad guys take over the country , do n't you - and then everybody gets scared .

finally , there was only one answer to a man like him -- the truth -- which i rose and gave to this body ! mr. president -- he has told lie upon lie -- every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt . and now , he is trying to blackmail this senate -- as he tried to blackmail me ! to prevent his expulsion , he would probably even try to hold up this deficiency bill -- vital to the whole country -- which must be passed immediately -- *today* ! *anything* -- to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide ! gentlemen -- i -- i have no more patience with this -- this *rascally* character . i apologize to this body for his appointment -- i regret i had ever known him . i -- i 'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and i refuse to listen to him any longer ! i hope every member of this body feels as i do !

what was that all about ?
but i 'm your cousin !
right .
yes .
you 're really something , ace .
that 's not far enough . you do n't know those guys ! but they know us . every hood in chicago will be looking for us -
about two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were ! mountains , prairie land , trees , streams ! a paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities -- you do n't know that country out there , do you , miss saunders ?

smythe , you 've been drinking .
i wo n't tell you it 'll stop feeling this bad ... but i can tell you , you did n't do anything wrong ... the same thing would have happened to me ... or frank ... or joe ... and there 's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen ... i used to try and ... always came up short . i do n't think the why so 's important as ... what we do with what we get . i remember this boy i 'd see up on the blackfeet reservation . he was sixteen . great kid . strong . he 'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock . snapped his neck , paralyzed him ... after the accident , i 'd look in on him from time to time ... and he was n't there anymore . his mind , his spirit , whatever you want to call it , it just disappeared . and what was left was nothing but anger ... it 's like the boy i knew just went away somewhere ...

dad .

but how do i know ... ?
it 's stopped .
that 's one - way of looking at it . you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain ' .
i do n't think it 's abuse , i think it 's torture .
it was n't reading , it was a performance . brilliant , vivid , something made of music and fire ...

i always find it surprising , mr. gardiner , to find men like yourself , who are working so intimately with the president , yet manage to remain relatively unknown .
yeah . scary stuff .
what about everything ? how did this happen ?

if nature gives a man a collector 's mind , it does n't matter what he collects . butterflies . old china . penny farthings . a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass .
the pain !

easthampton hospital for women . excuse me , what is that , a joke ? let me tell you something , doctor , those men at catherine laboure . men who are known not only in this city , but the world , were trying to save a woman 's life . they were there , and here you are , four years later , read some hospital report , and say ...

goddamnit ! goddamnit !
the past is the past . today is the beginning of the rest of our lives .
i 'm afraid to ask .
that 's your proof ?
i is for irresistible grace . god 's grace can not be resisted or denied . and p is for the perseverance of the saints . once you are in grace you can not fall from the number of the elect . and that 's the 'tulip . '

father said witches live there .
you ca n't be too careful . i 've been stalked . i 've been told i 'm highly stalkable . i do n't need that .
thank you david . however , flattery will get you nowhere . truth is , i have a rather different plan for whistler 's dear mama . bernie and i have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is , we can not survive with our current losses , so ...
have you ever seen annie hall ?
you smoke pall mall ?
was dead right . you think dunbar 's on the level ?
you ask what the point is ?
you can hardly blame him , the way you 've been taking care of business ... or should i say , not taking care of it .
this is a cobra , mr. grange . yes , it is real .
you 're having me on , molly .
i do n't rate that at all .
i watched him for fifteen years , sitting in a room staring at a wall , not seeing the wall , seeing past it , seeing this night . he 's waited for it , inhumanly patient . hour after hour , day after day , waiting for some silent , invisible alarm to trigger him . death has arrived in your little town , sheriff . you can ignore it , or you can help me stop it .
what 's going on , glenn ?
am i in trouble or something ?
uh , we uh-
they look nice .
no no . i knew .

sunlight , you say ?
well ...
you win .

hungry ? after twelve years in the burmese jungle . i am starving , lady agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
i 'm closing the door now . i told you , i 'll see you later .
they put the heat on , my man , just like you 're doing . i gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza . truth is , i never met the dude .
let 's hear the five 'f 's ' for today . f for ...
do n't `` joe '' me .
oh , no , really - i 'll be all right .
well , it has n't been that long .

i know you do . i love you too , annie . and you 're right . we are meant to be together . and i know we must die . but it must be so that misery can live . we have the power to give misery eternal life . we must finish the book .
hi dad .
what do you think we 're gon na do ? he 's probably got guys outside the fuckin ' house !
we do n't have any coffee .
i know . relax . take it easy . do n't worry , we 'll get those fuckers .

sal ... sal ... naturale , oh boy !
no kidding ?
... you heard echoes .
what ? ... what 'd you do ?
okay ... you were standing there looking at the moon ... you were eating grass ... then what ?
terry !

this is going to drive the ante up .
could n't sleep , pumper . is everything , uh , all right tonight ?
take a lesson from young masbath 's desires , ichabod crane . he follows with you to avenge his father 's death . that i understand . but , what do you want ?
i told you , i knew your sister .
yesterday i read that furtw鋘gler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in '36 , toscanini suggested it . had he accepted , he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america .
it sounds all well and good , but what if we 're wrong ?
uhh ... i 'm drawing a blank .
did n't you hear me , boy ?
to meet interesting people , improve myself . you would n't believe the losers we got over in port angeles .
yes . cyberdyne systems , model 101 .
you can call me ostreicher .

you scare me , riddick . that 's what you wan na hear , is n't it ? there , i admit it , can i get back to work now ?
i 'm freezing .
yes , but there 's just something about him . something around the eyes , i do n't know , reminds me of ... me . no . i 'm sure of it , i hate him .
ya 'll live around here ?
does it look okay ?
listen to me , fettes , i 'm one part befuddled with drink , one part over-heels in love with macfarlane , and one part fey . you 're a lowlander , fettes , and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight .
hey ! wait a minute , that 's my last piece of gum .
thank-q !
like your guitar break .
thank you for seeing me .
maybe i just want to hear you say it .
whatever .
oh yeah , he 's the real fireman . who are you ? just another probie working for swayzak --
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home .
it 's not your fault .
women .
i do n't know , what ? thirty , forty maybe .
if trusting you means trusting those fuckin ' killers , i ca n't do that . if you do n't tell the cops , i will .
it 's the safe bet , orson . there 's nothing wrong with that .
the day i left you i just drove and drove . i drove all day and all that night , and i did n't go anywhere . i just kept driving . i stopped at a little country church , and the pastor let me in , and i sat --
homework ?
boy , that is the real south . that is real corn liquor .

we practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club .
real mccoy .
no news yet ?
i know . i write like a child .
almighty lord , word of god the father jesus christ , god and lord of all creation , who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions . grant me , your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins ...

if a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the federation what happened here , then i welcome it .
to quarter-horses .
sweep the harbor .
i 'm going to try and tell people what we 've seen and --
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
so maybe we can pull off a texas switch on cuervo .
luther , i 'm looking at security .
it 's not what i was expecting .
hey boss , it 's not a science .
and this thing can grow it ?
mr. scott ?
mh-hm .
i bathed him , did n't i ? i fed him and cleaned up after him ! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern , then yes , i did treat him with loving kindness , and i 'm not ashamed to say it .
life support check . elaine , it 's obvious you 've been ignoring me . you 're a woman . i can relate to that .
i guess that 's what he looked like .
no . a friend ... your mother ? everybody gets touched by someone they love .
the system command processor , it 's the brain .

all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . okay ? you happy ? so now what ?
baby , you 'll check them tomorrow .
no , sir .
great question ! ! in the east ... the far east ... when a person is sentenced to death ... they 're sent to a place where they ca n't escape ... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head ... it could be days ... weeks ... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced ... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation , do n't you think ? it 's been a pleasure talking to you .
anything .
do n't do that .
sugar . i was slow dancing to that song before rachel was even born .
it 's cold .
earl , you must never do that again .

you going out for the henley hall play ? they 're doing `` a midsummer night 's dream . ''

diner up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
you having hearing problems , mister ?
is this part of the act or are they really hurt ?
so , i 'm done . thats it for today ?

much happier .
it 's not bullshit , it 's the only conclusion the data supports ...
why do they call them training bra 's ? it 's not like learning to ride a bike .
are you for real ?
i do n't get it -- you said your mission was to kill him . let 's do it , an ' get our asses outta here . this kurtz is ruining the war ; i mean , this do n't look good for america !
i 'm a giant semi-conductor , and there 's alien creatures all around us . form the eighth dimension , i think . look ...
it 's clear .
she looks a lot like you .
i got an idea on that one . once you 're up there , you got ta hold those guards down till some backup can get there . there 's a security camera room that videotapes everything . you 've got ta destroy every last one of those tapes .
so mitchell had handled it . afterwards , brandon picked it up . there 's no indication you handled it .

mother killed the father , then killed herself . crime of passion .
you know i 'm a good person .
that did n't leave much for wallace reid .
that you killed hollis mulwray .
all i mean is ... someone like you ...
what ?
c'mon , joey .
i think you 're the devil .
well , just what the hell do you expect me to do ?
yeah , right . you ca n't get enough of me .
you 're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray .
we have no right to do this . they deserve to know .
she was torn apart ! she died of a broken heart .

four . you had four leads . one kicked out , one the judge , you say ...
i do n't want to make friends .
he did n't do it -- nick !
right , whatever , have fun .
which way ?
get your fucking hands off my daughter !
... ten minutes .
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .
yes .
well , i 'm not borrowing any more money from my mother , and that 's that !
that would n't be very sporting . remember huxley ? `` his play is always fair and just . ''
they probly thought you was crazy .
counselor . what can i do for you ?
why ? why ? did you hear that , stu ? i think she wants a motive . hmmm ... i do n't really believe in motives , sid . i mean , did norman bates have a motive ?
mm .
you once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner . that sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win . do you remember ?
small miracles better than no miracles ...
do you like the way i look ?
comment va-t-elle ?
yeah , it might be .
what did you pay him ?
why were you sitting here , instead of ...
i told him .
the redistribution of wealth .
oh yeah . i 'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner , huh ?
okay , fine . sure
it 's the president 's personal property ! i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedy-loving harvard democrat cocksuckers !
somebody said she was here .
i think so .
that sudden ?
carson was dying so they were forced to leave him . they finally got back to the base , made their report , and waited for the war to end . only charles could n't wait quite as long as the others . he beat them back to the gold , took everything for himself and disappeared . it 's taken gideon , tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again .
the good doctor signed our death warrant .
simplicity , hawk .
i 'm incarcerated , lloyd ! i do n't deserve to lose my daughter over this . i do n't deserve to have you as my go-between . and i ca n't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you .
it 's already begun .
why should n't we ? if we c'n get it we 're entitled to it .
yeah .
i 'd like to talk to you about madison .
jefferies .
no problem , is it at your place ?
sorry i hit jackson .

rusty parr had the right idea on child care .
i 'm sorry ... i ca n't hear you . i ca n't turn my head all the way yet ... tell her we ca n't hear her .
nothing ...
i think it抯 good to be a little unsure about who you are . it抯 very human .
we 're fucked , i know --
you made your decision yet ?
you okay , rose ?
because a lot of people would 've gotten killed . probably all the wrong ones .
we 're doing fine . take the next right .
has it been fifteen minutes ?
yeah .
what are you talking ...
then on behalf of my weiner , i 'd like to ask for an advance .
and that chair -- is the particular property of mrs. rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us . too wise , in fact , to live under the same roof . she prefers the village dispensary .
all my life i 've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind . well this is it . this is power !
i 'll go down and speak to him .
there is no masbath here . my father 's loan papers are missing .

i try really hard , actually ...

continued
it 's a lot of ground to cover . we 'll try . funny coincidence , huh ?
just because it 's in my mind , goldmouth , do n't mean it ai n't real . everything worth anything starts with a dream .
uh , i do n't have much of an appetite lately .
what 's going to happen to stensland ? he 'll give himself cirrhosis over this . < u > he 's one < /u > < u > year from his pension < /u > .
twenty-nine .
i 'm not much of a critic .
why do n't you ask the mosebacke ? brazil . until 44 years ago they ate with their hands , lived in huts , and did n't even know the rest of the world existed . 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork . today , they do n't exist .
he 's right . two people must have pocketed their ballots . usually it 's more .
well , i do n't care if it 's legal or not , we 're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we ca n't even go visit her because she 's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray .
how many ?
that 's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking . never shut up .
you ca n't learn that in an office . eh ? he 's right . you have to learn it on the streets . you ca n't buy that . you have to live it .
michael ! ...
do you know how many different kinds of laws we 've broken ?
jesus , we 're trapped !
then how can we know who is truly good , and who is evil ?
arrest me .
for this .
yeah ! and just look at this ruler !
i do n't think so .

jesus , i do n't believe it ...
perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced .
rosomoff , i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents .
maddy , what did you do to your hair ?
these birds were ...
well , what do you have for me today ?
you got to investigate . no question about it .
i give two minutes . for you , and your gallant crew . take every last man : form a boarding party , armed heavily !
when you get back , i 'll be gone --
a guy named brill . same guy as always .
animal ! when the war 's over , remember i told you i 'd fix you up with betty grable !
you can not ! not for the queen herself !
we 'll go to my bank . i 'll make a withdrawal .
then where 's the goddamn conway twitty coming from ?
and then what , truman ? we 'd be back to where we were five years ago . you 're talking like a teenager .
i 'm with you , lover .
well ...
no , we 'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying , and we 'll just assume it all went to plan .
this is something .
coffee and ...
that 's where my best customers are . marion berry , george bush , the redskins . i 'd like to offer you a job , cindy . can you type ? take dictation ? swallow balloons filled with cocaine ?

thank you .
i 've been thinking about you a lot all these years , locked up in my cell . i 'd tear through every issue of the midwest science journal looking for your latest findings , watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies , the fruit fly . exciting stuff . i got to tell you , it really kept me going .
right . vicious circle . and then i was like rooting around in your things , and found this , and i thought -- cool . kind of spacey .
yes . give me your news , zoe .

i 'm okay ... listen to me ... let 's go with judge , check it out .
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum .
that 's not true . some of us have great stories ... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad . just not anybody in this car . but lots of people -- that 's their story -- good times and noodle salad ... and that 's what makes it hard . not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good .
thank you for the guided tour , but would you mind telling me what we抮e doing here ?
at these boys ' age ? not on your life ! tradition , john . discipline . prepare them for college , and the rest will take care of itself .

part of the deal : bruno cancels out what they did to my father .
what 's that ?
can you walk ? it 's not broken , is it ?
hm .
belinda 's telling everyone that kiss was real .
hello , goodbye , i want you , i hate you . it抯 all just words . none of it means anything . what matters is what you do . you either stay put or you walk away . if you look back , you抮e not walking away !
don抰 go , jack ...
round about , yeah .
i do n't have a job , but i would have a job if you gave me one . and i may not have much , but i have more determination than any man you 're ever going to meet .

humbly , m'lord .
but now you 're telling us now you do .
you 're so easy ...
there 's no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power .

i could subpoena him if i had a week .
that 's just it , buddy . i 'm a girl . you ca n't be so rough with me .

what is the danger from the chinese , now ?
did you have a pleasant trip ?
maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket ?
she told me .
i miss him too ...
no , she 's getting married .
you should talk to elaine . that was her best friend .
they tried ... but i did n't let them .
says he ca n't walk .
angelo , we live and die by the rules we make . we are men of honor , but honor without respect is a ... horse-less carriage .
we have a warrant . to search your boat .
i just think you should'a kept him off me , that 's all .
my jewels ? !

have you ever thrown up in the front row of a richard marx concert ?
tractor beam strength lessening , captain .
i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret , mr. crawford . truth will out ... and then what ? will you give johns hopkins a new identity ? put a big pair of sunglasses on this building , and a funny nose ?
this is terrific work , if you like rejection .
it 's the tight girdle that does it .
jerome -- ?
being clever .
nobody knows more about this thing than you do , john .
i know dottie !
you ca n't hurt me more than i 'm hurt already .
dad !
he did everything he could to take care of his heart ?
i do n't know what else to tell you . i was n't hiding out . i hit my head and i did n't remember anything until a few days ago .
we 've progressed emotionally in --
you must decide . you might get tired of this life . you might begin to miss your family . if it were our daughter , we 'd look for her too . she would miss us . jen ... i want you to be mine forever . i will make my mark on the world . i will earn your parents ' respect . we have a legend . anyone who dares to jump from the mountain , god will grant his wish . long ago , a young man 's parents were ill , so he jumped . he did n't die . he was n't even hurt . he floated away , far away , never to return . he knew his wish had come true . if you believe , it will happen . the elders say , `` a faithful heart makes wishes come true . ''
ah - you 've heard that ?

you got ta hold this for me .
who 's he ?
john . john , you all right ?

riddle me this , batman . if you 're all so much in love with each other , what the fuck are you doing here ? i 'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin ' up a panther 's ass . your guy 's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play joe fuckin ' hollywood till the wheels come off . he can sell it , he can snort it , he can play santa claus with it . at the price he 's payin ' , he 'll be everybody 's best friend . and , you know , that 's what we 're talkin ' about here . i 'm not puttin ' him down . hey , let him run wild . have a ball , it 's his money . but , do n't expect me to hang around forever waitin ' for you guys to grow some guts .

cbs does not do that . and , you 're questioning our journalistic integrity ? !
the hockey player ? he a friend of yours ?
flattery will get you everywhere , my boy . but i 'm afraid i have to trust floris on this one . you see , she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western . perhaps you 've read her memoirs , `` i ca n't understand a word any of you are saying . ''

'vampires require a daytime protector -- a < u > guardian < /u > -- to watch over them as they sleep . for it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable . since they hold sway over animals , < u > fierce dogs -- the hounds of hell < /u > < u > -- are often employed for this < /u > < u > purpose < /u > . '

where 's your husband ?
you know , even if we do get those tapes back , people are going to say it 's just another hoax . ian malcolm 's alien autopsy .
who are these people ?
you 're an actor . find the zen in the role .
call me vince .
yeah , right .
ramona ! ramona !
this is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex .
it was a hard assignment , that 's why you got it .
you vouch for him ?
he had business at the hotel , but he 'll drop in for dinner .
sorry .
it galls me to watch you . you can do as much in days as i can in years . men like the 'the dreamer ' are protected . out of everyone 's grasp it seems , but yours .
oh no , not a computer disc . a computer disc ? oh man , come on , what do i look like ? i 'm not a crime- fighter , i 'm not a detective , what , i 'm supposed to find some `` clues '' on this disc . i ca n't ...
i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .
... or nephew or some good old boy ...
so here we go .
when ? how ?
how could i forget ?
about suzie ?
too true . you know , bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they 're in a relaxed setting , do n't you think ?
yes !
oh .
i am ?
the truth .
whew ... okay , hand me those padlocks .
get mitch cohn on the phone in new york , tell him she 's breaking her contract and we 're very up ...
shit .
if you like . but do n't be too modest , james . the citizen 's duty is to remember , not necessarily to write books . you are highly qualified . you 're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job . every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history . a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you .
i hate to say it ...
she 's tremendously gifted , this girl .
bully ? are we talking about gary boyd ? or your dad .
the cop who found the knife in corvis 's car .
so you 're still that little boy looking for shooting stars .
i fell asleep .
dad , did you do it ? did you take that money ?
when ?
shit . i think i started a fire .
yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there . hueys , lots of 'em .
did katharine say ? - geoffrey has to fly back to cairo .
i 'm sure you 'll be all right .
alex , really ... good luck tonight . she 's a fine girl , and she 's done wonderful things for you .
how do you know i took it ? how do you know they did n't just give it to me ?
well , that 's you see , what i am , kind and feeling .
-- roger -- ?
that could be a serious accusation , rand , if it were n't a foolish one .
what 's wrong ?
dr. bright , i do n't have to do anything .
thank you .
it is not . get out .
oh , man , you 're not going to fall for that .
get away from her .
because it had to look random . not connected to anything or anyone . but then why give the rape to me ?
i think you 're trying to tell me something .
hey , you 're not settling for the two shots are you ? knock me out girl . it 's the only way .
let me go !
not afraid of the dark , are you ?
bye , dad .
they ca n't . they ca n't get in here . no . they ca n't .
listen , you need me .
uh , yeah . i 'm a policeman .
it 's just that sometimes i wonder what team i 'm playin ' on .
boy , took you all of thirty seconds to blow that .
but , mary -- everybody 's having such a great time -- why spoil it ?
it must 've been tuesday . he was wearing his `` cornflower-blue '' tie .
i still see that boy 's eyes .
you do n't know the real me .
i say , good morning , lovey .
but the poor kid 's going crazy . she 'd rather know her father was dead than that ...
i thought the same thing , right off the bat . that 's why we went to see the doctor . but hunh-uh . turns out one 's got nothing to do with the other .
well , i , uh , i 'll be leaving town for a little while .
i guess they musta sent 'im to another camp .
that 's what i got ta tell you . she bugged me the whole time . got pissy with me 'cause i would n't let her carry the bag . started running her fuckin ' mouth ... i could n't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked , so she got on me about that . `` is it this aisle lou- is , is it that one ? '' she was totally fuckin ' with my nerves .
yes .
what 's plan c ?
chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer .
first , i would like to say i love the show . it 's very courageous . my parents marched in selma , alabama with dr. king .
a spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the waterford huskies ...
get on the phone , have'em fly in a ... whaddaya need to be a citizen ? a judge ? whaddaya need ? a judge ... ? call in a < u > judge < /u > , call in a federal < u > judge < /u > , and ... if you 're concerned about him , being an ... '' immigrant . '' make him a < u > citizen < /u > ... eh ? < u > guys < /u > ... what 's all this < u > mopery < /u > , we ...
objection , we 've ...
get going , will you , brady -- before i get mad !
it sounded like it came from the courtyard .
first thing we got to do is get out of these clothes .
i ca n't believe he just jumped you .
you sure ?
how did you get here ? did you play the game ? !
david , david ! what the hell are you doing ! ?
i really do n't want to spoil your surprise , frank . why do n't you read it tomorrow ?
talked him out of it . he thinks we 're going to stay a week . i 'll have to think of something before morning .
what about it ?
is her mother still lying on the floor ?
why would you want me to kill you ?
i do n't know , bob . what about one of those ?
i have a job .
what did you expect ? bronze ?
dwayne listen to me -
no . i got lucky with the lights .
robin was robin masters . he owned the estate they lived on ...
that 's right . not my style , reggie..
because i do n't have to . the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism ' or alien ship . and by the way , they call it acheron now .
the hell she is n't . lillian 's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her . i 'm gon na hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing , this divorce thing , rearranged . i 've been thinking about it a lot . it 's like she owns jill or something . nobody owns nobody , especially not kids . and i pay her .
you got ta use your imagination .
i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
what ? you got ta be joking .
just listen . you do n't have to do anything criminal .
not anymore . oh , some time ago , my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in long beach , but we lost it .
we face each other as god intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .
did you know mrs. rexroth was married ?
really ?
two-fifty .
it 's fine .
woman drivin ' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . she called the police and they came over and arrested me . thought i was a sniper ! boys at the vfw loved that one . cops did n't understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . i was gon na put out poison , but i was afraid somebody 's cat would eat it . hell , i had six cats myself . so i used the .22 because it did n't make much noise and the ammo was cheap .
i know .
well , i only quote from the best .
of course not . does he look lost to you ? bennnnn ! ! !
what 's your problem ? i 'm doing the job .
is it true ?
you got wine . that 's great .
all right . i 'll try anything once .
advance , sergeant major !
what for ?
why , eckhardt . you should be thinking about the future .
is there any possibility that it 's a hoax ? could you be mistaken ?
why not me ?
like the old days , dillon .
no . although i 've studied them in the wild .
granted . where are you going ?
well , even without anesthesia i always tell my patients to ... eh ... to relax .
who ?
oh , claudia , you 've outdone yourself . where did you find them ?
no . they occupy the fortress , but they can not control its movement . it is moved by fate . and , sooner or later , fate will place it near us .
hm ?
does the yardman come today ?
look , i 'm just going to come right out and tell you why i 'm here , okay ?
he gave these to you ?
home school ? what 's that ?
well , i was born to be a mother . some of us are .
what kind of chromium is it ?
a little less than yesterday .
abc ... ?
that 's a different story . i 'm still working on that one , you know , getting the visual fabric just right . although i 've added to it .
is there anything i can do ?
just give me the key . i 'm gon na stay here .
why , do you think we 're going to ?
and here i thought you flew in some out of town muscle . how 's it going , men ?
that they 're lying .
wait a minute . i 'll go with you .
and your store ? what about your new store ? what about all your dreams ?
do you have a soul-mate ?
i think so .
white boy , how much is the reward on the man again ?
but you have n't lost your mystery ! you 're very mysterious !
tell me again .
yes !
was there anything unusual about the driver , dolores driscoll , or the bus that particular morning ?
jade fox ? impossible .
are you looking for this ?
i mean ... `` ants . '' `` i 've got a problem with ants . ''
what do you love about it ?
what , jack ? that tomorrow night beneath the full moon i 'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people ? bullshit !
that girl ? no , never saw her . i do n't know anybody .
i love you too , dad . goodnight .
can i enter ?
i was watchin ' you ... seein ' if you was followed .
we 're not gon na go see any fuckin ' elephants , okay ?
when you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two . it is now five forty-three . when you ask a minute from no , it will be-
that 's right .
there is no us , remember ?
we 'll get you together !
you 're drunk .
no . i 'm the exact opposite --
you find any work ?
mr. president ! a point of order !
i know where to look .
i 'll take them up to my mother 's if it 'll make you feel better . spend a week . i 'll change the locks , the phone lines , i 'll even get a bodyguard , all right ? elizabeth , get a hold of yourself .
so do you .
i promise i 'll make more time for jasper .
she 's definitely part of this . it 's weird , for a while ivy was all i could think about . but then ...
thank you .
that was before he lost my carpet cleaning van .
oh ! help me ! the balloon 's going up !
god , viktor . why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ?
what ?
it 's always in the more gifted of the three .
i 'm here about some monkeys .
you do n't know anything ! listen colon , these are my ships , right ? so i 'm telling you we 're turning back !
yeah , it 's good .
i like you , country .
if it 's okay with you i 'm going to bobby 's to do my homework .

i can make you rich .
but i know she 's grateful for the care you 're giving her .
thank you , sir .
really ? already ? the summer 's just begun .
actually , no , i 've changed my mind . i should n't have called .
what do you want me to say ? that it all sounds mysterious ?
horace mill -- !
i ... i shot a kid .
your writing . it 's amazing , josie . you 're really talented . and far less depressing than dorothy parker .
that 's a public course . no stephanie ?
and ask me what it 's costing us to hammer it down .
that was her - the girl ... we have to go .
you do n't seem excited , my little muffin .
not quite . i just called , and they said he checked out five days ago . is n't that a little strange ?
i see , all right -- it 's time for us to get out of this field .
you 're very funny --
funny . i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning .
what are we doing here , diego ? this guy 's a clown . he 's talking about clothes .
mayonnaise ? donald loved mayonnaise . why would you think that was the problem . ?
what did you watch ?
there 's a bomb here . it 's going to go off at seven-thirty .
do n't make my mistake , kid ... do n't ... be a grunt ... your whole life ...
i 'm getting a little bit fat . i hate that .
do you ? i mean , are you , are you , are you , are you free this evening ?
from what you saw , did huey newton start the shooting ?
i know ! i know !
when we were growing up i always felt like you would take care of things , that everything would be okay . but you ca n't make this okay , can you ?
... i thought you were dead . going home ?
he was n't designed to live a complete , human life span .
e11ie - diedre died at five o'clock this morning . obviously , there are 1egal matters . your discretion will be -
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a `` pompous ... fellow ... ''
any more , o -- ?
i ...
if i can presume to go into the emperor 's mind , i believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of moscow . when vienna fell , there was a peace treaty . when berlin fell , another treaty . that has always been the rules of the game . but what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming ? he knows that beyond moscow , there is nothing , and that , if he withdraws , there remains only a fall into emptiness .
i thought only punks fought with knives .
well , nobody can say we did n't try .
you do n't want to hear that i got cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid . that this is n't surgery
this place is an untapped resource . check it out , dude , these vocal jazz girls are < u > hot < /u > .
i had a good time tonight , miles . i really did .
i did n't mean ... it 's seems vulgar or something , i know --
i know what i see .
what 's this country coming to ?
who 's in charge here ?
absolutely . when i come back , maybe the two of us should spend some time together , on our own . what do you think ?
what were you -- a child actress ?
you 're not like the other boys we 've had here . granted , i ca n't understand what you 're saying either , but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis .
you have very nice ceilings .
of course ,
i 'm starting to forget her .
the tv .
yeah ? ! well ... i loved her too .
right .
have you come to talk about me ?
musta been a lesson tellin ' ya it was the wrong time ... what did you do , your mama find out ?
come on ... put his head in place .
longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
my god ...
koontz ! let her come in ! claire ! it 's pitch dark in here ! you 're gon na have trouble seeing anything , so just come in , and straight down a long hall . then stand at the door so we can see you . we want to see your face and we wo n't be able to until you get to the kitchen door !
you have no idea what precipitated his behavior ?
god , no .
my wife is not the issue here . i hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance , which is ample , but if she does n't , sir , that will be her problem , not mine , just as your rug is your problem , just as every bum 's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame . i did n't blame anyone for the loss of my legs , some chinaman in korea took them from me but i went out and achieved anyway . i ca n't solve your problems , sir , only you can .
thank you very much .
what about eric and dr. grant ?
shrimp and fries .
and i 'm a working man ! we 're a regular working-class tragedy !
disco ex -- man , that group sucked like a squid , they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug , back in my publicist days ...
we have a multiple homicide , sir ..
huh ?
fritz ? what are you talking about ? who 's fritz ?
had a close one , eh ?
yeah . yes . i do n't follow music too much .
i have your questionnaire here . it says you were never a member of the nazi party .
figured i was dead , there , when i seen that angel comin ' toward me .
oh , ray ... no ...
biederman ! where 's biederman !
i know . i just like to see you get all worked up .
no good . i 've known too many spaniards .
sir ! sir , i 'm sorry ! he did n't mean it ! he was trying to get me .
you ca n't lose me , sally -- i 'm no lily myself !
i 'm not sure . that 's the funny thing about him . he 's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it .
we will , baby ... all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves .
i just got goosebumps .
i suppose you 'd use them as collateral on new loans , would n't you ?
here i am bragging my mom is the tooth fairy , and i 'm talking to santa 's kid !
then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son . what gives you the right to judge me , to play god with the lives of others ? is it because you are so much holier than everyone else ? !
you see what i mean ? you 're being defensive . is n't she being defensive , bob ?
well ?
well , that depends - on whether you 're coming or going - i mean , normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that 's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne ?
uh -- what ?
i read you sir .
she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo . i guess to get me running . did you tell her about my stash ?
and what does that level of spending on first-class , private- sector infrastructure signify to you ?
john , i know all about it .
your boy is very lucky , mr. kramer . one inch over and it would have caught the eye .
that tall , bright building . near there .
how about a little game later ?
assure them that you 're being well treated .
he does n't need my help .
all right with me , i used to drive a taxi .
the marquis de la tours . he was in the lobby . but i do n't think he saw me . i 'm positive he did n't . thank heaven ! ... but when i came up here , right out in the hall there was king boris of alconia !
negroes would be in an uproar .
the idiot .
so we on the same page then ?
then blame the one who made her ...
you have n't even seen it !
one of you must be mistaken .
he ai n't our daddy !
yeah .
if i surprise you , let me explain . menial work teaches us humility .
damn , dr. weir , do n't scare us like that . coffee ?
then do n't hassle it .
i rented a car -- it 's going to be here at one o'clock -- we 're driving to atlantic city .
i 'm sick of niggers , it 's a bad neighborhood . i do n't like being around them , they 're animals .
there are no worse places .
listen , we know their names . they do n't know the city . you 'll find them . you 're the fbi .
well we ca n't talk in here . they 're having the place painted .
you 're gon na like night clubs , they 're really a lotta fun .
it 's ... .whatever ... .that 's not cool .
okay . be careful .
wo n't mother be proud .
kristina 's fine .
floyd say he do n't be eatin ' pussy .
this conversation 's over .
yeah . everybody 's talkin ' about it . they 're makin ' a big deal out of it .
i 'm not afraid of her . i 'll see you get safely to the wizard now , whether i get a brain or not ! stuff a mattress with me ! hah !
who ?
you ?
he is !
oh , i suppose it was to the wind you sang , or maybe to the sun , or the clouds , or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden .
guess you do n't want to see the greatest show on earth . and in detroit no less . well , take care , chief .
karl , what in the world are you doing here ?
kill type ?
perfect , wyatt . simply perfect .
if you want to .
what 's he done that 's so bad - take money ? that 's a crime ? come on , what are we here for , to fight a war ? we 're here to make money , all of us .
tell me the truth hector ... do you think we 'll find my car ?
call me that again , and you 're going to find a boot where it does n't belong .
leave the gorillas .
well , a 'course , taxes provide your basic service -- police and whatnot . but our customers need a little more than just that , you understand ? this badge does n't mean that i am a peace officer .
watch me .
do you recognize this young man ?
you do n't have to tell me that . it 's just , i know my bid was low , but was it too low ? i mean , did i seem like an amateur , like i did n't know what i was doing ?
they 're newspaper men , mollie . they ca n't help themselves . the lord made them that way .
he paid for 'em .
good shooting , danny !
that 's what i 've been trying to tell these people .
developer ran out of money years back . i 'd hate to think about what 's living in there .
be my guest , agent kulok , scrub suits are in the back .
you knew the entire time ? can you give me one good reason why i should n't kill you right now ?
but you did ... you did !
i was n't there last night , either .
this is how we fill up our lives .
would n't surprise me none . wicker man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the captain 's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money ... that 'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards . you in or out ?
what ?
tell me , did he kill his little victims too ?
without disrespect , look around you . we overflow . as do our courts .
seven tomorrow evenin ' . we can eat at galatoire 's . fix it .
okay ... maybe that would be best .
that boyfriend . randy .
who are all these people ?
i 'll have to re-energize .
three cents .
i was wondering .
bill , after this deal , you 'll be able to afford one .
jeez , it all looks like bad late-night cable .
you ca n't bribe me !
you never know . lightning could strike .
you have no authority to make a deal like that . that ' s for the d.a ...
if i could be of any help ...
approximately forty-seven minutes , sir .
you mean hiding them ?
i do n't know what to say . look , i -- i just -
do n't ask me questions . i got connections . you find out who i am , you 're cold meat .
that depends . sisters , you do n't know this , but reverend mother 's been making all sorts of noises about resigning . that 's bad news . i do n't know if we could sing , if we thought that was true .
i paid you back .
i do n't know what i take you for anything ...
claire .
i do n't trust him .
uh , mr. gekko , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on tarafly ... ... about 50 thousand .
vlad , stop acting this way ! you 're my friend !
that 's great .
good idea . thank you .
but here at the hotel dieu we favor an ... aggressive ... course of treatment .
yeah .

mrs. phillips , how long have you known ted kramer ?
hey . this is my business . do i tell you your business .
wave from the door ... go down the stairs ... get into the limo ...
it 's what you said , mom . mr. brinkmeyer 's feed is no good .
annie , that adds up to a jealous , possessive woman .
no ... in the brains ... what little i 'm sure he has .
i see .
and before here ?
no ...
if you get me pregnant with a boy he 'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne .
you do n't believe in god anymore .
i 'm getting seasick --
that 's why she hates me . that 's why she makes me sleep in the basement .
sorry .
good work , ostreicher .

i tell you , engineering this kind of play against sparazza , going to the lengths these guys are going to ... they 're playing some long odds .
not long ... a few days .
is she ?
north korean beaches are the best protected , most heavily monitored in the world . the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system . extraction team has to be small and silent -- i 'd go with seals over delta force . problem is , do n't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice . where 's the polk ?
what 's happening ? !
i see . i myself can not . you use evyan skin cream , and sometimes you wear l'air du temps , but not today . you brought your best bag , though , did n't you ?

that must be the tenth alienist they 've had on williams . even if he was n't crazy before , he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him . gim me the desk .
david , stop stressing , you can like -- turn it on normally ...
well , maybe that 's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down . but me : i need some challenge in my life . some adventure ... even just a surprise or two .
it must have taken him a long time to get them together .
no ...
guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
it 's not a charade , all this ?
bye , uncle cort . what 's with the lie ?
what ?
... school 's fine ...
i am very pleased to meet you .
in the room . were you serious , or were you just foolin ' around ? i 'm just bringing it up , 'cause if you really want me to do that for you , i will .
you 'd think on a ship this size there 'd be something left to eat .
i miss tommi so much .
i told you i ca n't .
if we do n't invite all the seniors we ca n't use the school funds , you know that .
it will be horrible . the future . i may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows . i can promise you nothing . nothing but a moment . maybe two . but a moment of love , is that not worth a lifetime ?
hello !
there you are ! barnard , you 'd better get your things together . we 're leaving .
hello constance . it 's me , lloyd ... nothing , i 'm just driving around ... she broke up with me ... what do i do ? ca n't she come back ? how can i get her back ? ... i ca n't think , talk to me ... i fucked up ... i feel like crying ... she gave me a pen . i gave her my heart and she gave me a pen .
i 'm going to ask you one last time and if i do n't get an answer , i do n't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least . where 's my chest , jessica ?
i do n't know . they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays .
i like my bath all right . how do you like your bath ?
do n't thank me . it was entirely simone 's decision . do you have simone 's check ?
he 's not exactly what we call `` a spring chicken '' .
my father said i should 've gotten a lawyer -- !
barnes believes in what he 's doing .
that 's what i like about you . you think about a man 's feelings . i 'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that 's writing that stuff ?
i aspire to be more than i am .
you 're lucky . i almost pulled the trigger .
now do n't get nervous . it 's just your husband .
... he 'd just found out about track 2 .
all my life i 've known .
once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction , and when i could n't make way quick enough she spat in my face .
baby , i 've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing , have stared into the face of hell . these are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and i feel beaten by them , i feel bloodied --
and we really do have to talk .
big shot ! for you , i would n't lift a finger -- but for her , i 'll fix a little something to eat .
well , she was already dead , darling , was n't she , so i suppose --
i suspected as much .
luck 's a funny thing . especially the bad .
it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn . i ca n't be sure , peter .
in a week .
oh , petey . oh , petey . oh , please , pete . please do n't do this to me . okay .
yeah ? well now he 's a junkie . he do n't deserve to work .
that farmers ' association -- we were talking about the other day .
would you like to read it ? it 's to you .
oh , josephine - just imagine - me , sugar kowalczyk , from sandusky , ohio , on a millionaire 's yacht . if my mother could only see me now -
and you did a bang-up job , too . but you do n't want other producers to know that 's you in drag . trust me . it 's a career killer .
henry lucas .
do ? hell , nothing . well , you 'll want to keep tabs on your investment , of course , but i 'm looking for a silent partner . i 've done the research , i 've contacted the vendors , the deal is set . i 'm just looking for venture capital , friend . disappear if you want , check in whenever you like -- i want the dough ; i do n't take attendance .
i got a bad feelin ' , llewelyn .
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams ?
i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous .
suzanne ? very pretty . she was a semi- professional model . but a policeman 's wife she was n't . so one day , she just packed it and left . and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet .
the door from the patio , in back .
that storm center has n't dissipated or changed course . we 're going to have to cut the tour short , i 'm afraid . pick it up again tomorrow where we left off .
can i undress and talk at the same time ?
no . we 're never getting a divorce . we were having a fight . it happens sometimes .
twombley sure as hell wo n't be shooting it again .
batteries . i planned the generator for the house next week . i wished i had n't waited . this is squawk 79er zero of haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency . can anyone hear me ?
ok. well , i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago . he was partially frozen for thirty years . i never knew him growing up . he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business .
why not ?
so how ... ?
it 's not gross . how else do you think girls learn ? here turn around and face me .
then do n't .
hell , you 're the district attorney . you read the warren report - and then you tell me you 're satisfied lee oswald shot the president all by his lonesome .
sounds toasty . we 're going pavilion .
they 're all your enemies ?
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ...
what is it you want ?
damn it , norman ! he 's lying . do n't you get it ? there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he 's causing it . why ca n't you believe me ?
... not the lazyboy ...
what 's wrong , carl , you hardly ate anything ...
a notch above the storage room .
i 've heard of sugai . i 've also heard of the emperor . they 're both national treasures . one 's a hood .
it 's safe .
out shopping -- you 're bleeding , dad --
it 's beautiful .
you must return here with a shrubbery or else ... you shall not pass through this wood alive !
how long you think this 'll take ?
wha ' ?
oh my god , that was good . where 'd you learn all those new tricks ?
he does n't think so much of you either .
now , get out ! !
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage .
well , i assume you let him kiss you ?
if i had n't tried , the cost would have been my soul .
okay .
it抯 the past . it抯 nothing but ghosts . so just get it off your chest , then let抯 go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu .
which was n't too hard , the guy was a real squid .
you should be thanking me .
what do we know ? it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific . an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years .
no , i 'm callin ' from the playboy mansion .
candy ?
guess it 's our turn .
what do you want ?
no problem . i 'm not in a hurry .
can we get a doctor at that ranch ?
two of us might be more effective than one .
he wanted me to live .
i met a friend of yours the other night , doctor . tall fellow . no hair . rather pale skin ...
of course .
larry , i 'm askin ' you to trust me on this .
then you should go back to your table .
what ?
if you like -- just hurry !
he 's conducting experiments of his own .
finding the real world to your liking , mr. carter ?
um-huh .
how are you today ?
what do we need another shill for ?
see me around to my car , marty , and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long .
i gather he 's late as usual .
well , you rascal , where 'd you come from ?
thirty five dollars .
< u > whatever < /u > you need . the city council , of course , has to pass on your ...
mm-hm .
strange .
it was that place . that creepy cemetery up in the woods . whatever disease the kids in this town have got , i do n't want ellie to catch it .
we got friends in the commission .
you remember me ?
`` one falls , two shall arise . '' so : you pop one , two come out . you kill two , you get four . you kill four , you 're in trouble . we have to nail 'em all at once . and the eggs .
are they dead ?
police . nobody move .
how so ?
if i accept that letter and you told a court of law i accepted it , they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts . just wait kay , he 'll contact you .
then just help me find a girlfriend ! that 's all i ask . i 'll give you every single card i 've got left !
jorgensen 's been runnin ' his cattle with my own ...
what kind of a question is that ? of course : i am . i do whatever i want . all the time .
eight . but i have a sorority meeting till nine , so i 'll be back before you close . can we go out and get some coffee ?
how can you say that to me ?
as for our plan of action , anybody 'd be insane to go in from the ground floor ...
we 're americans .
where are you from ?
i would never hurt you , liza . think whatever you want , but do n't think that .
what are you doing ? give that back !
we were classmates .
it 's good exercise , mom .
yeah ?
he 's a client of mine ! what 's the matter . you ca n't suspect dieter . he 's a famous photographer . he makes millions .
your grandfather had one iron rule that 's stood me well . never fraternize with the help . keep too your own station . am i clear ?
i should have known something like this was going to happen !
right ... that 's ... er ... that 's nice of you , terri . can i ask ? is it always this ... exploratory ?
when your first officer insists that you ca n't go on away missions ... ignore him .
and , i 'm asking you to trust me without understanding why .
what 's through here ?
oh .
i wan na leave . get me out of here .
we 're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools . world history since 1945. twelve programmes , lots of stock film .
whatever it was , they 'll be here . we sent out invitations to everyone , plane tickets included -- the rsvp 's are amazing . a few of them we did n't hear from , and some of them are dead , of course --
god bless america .
yes it is . and it does n't mean anything .
i do n't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . not even a sewer or a storm drain .
you know it 's true .
ancient greece . alchimadus was imprisoned by his king .
jesus .
just what you see , pal .
how come you 're not wearing my shoes ?
to my own special sissy . cheers ! and welcome . so my letter brought ya flying , eh ? where were you ? salt lake city ? la conner ? well , i may have a little surprise for you . but first , tell me about yourself . it 's been six months , has n't it ? in some circles that 's half a year . how are you ?
nice .
i want you in dr. gardner 's office at nine o'clock . you 're out of control , curran .
obviously the name is n't real -- she 's using an assumed identity , travels under a false name , checks into hotels with an alias . she never stays in the same place two nights in a row . anything on the satellite photos ? what about the fingerprints ? what happened when we dusted that hotel suite ?
this is our last chance to play `` what if '' . i want to do it . i 'm just scared of getting caught .
steady ! ! ... now , mr. sulu !
the don himself is coming to me tonight ?
hey , tabloids paid ted bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview . and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her ? it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country . look , you want magazine or not ?
what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?
so nice
who are they ?
hurry back , please . i 'm sleepy .
oh . well , where do we start ?
it 's okay ... it 's okay ...
i think you just put your finger on it , i do .
i wan na take that fucking blind in- stitute to pieces .. every address book , every phone call , everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
what do you mean ?
they 're new to us ...
what was going on in there , how could she jump off the bed like that ?
but i thought vampires did n't like the light .
it 's our pleasure .
i ca n't forget it . i 'm still hungry .
tell me .
well , lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i 'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular . it 'd be a big help .
stop bein ' so damn understandin ' .
fah from it ...
and we 're very grateful .
i 'll call you mark when you catch the killer , detective .
what !
you are so mean .
who ?
there are always notices going up .
nobody lives within twenty-five miles , 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake . teenagers trek in every once in a while , none have disappeared , and none have spotted anything unusual .
they 're connecting the conduits to subspace communications ...
ok .
you 're roommates ?
dude , let 's help terrance and phillip ! !
right . sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you 're partying with a thousand cops .
where is your courage , comrade buljanoff ?
uh-huh .
a fender strat . you bought this ?
i did n't think so .
what ?
so forget what you 've seen on sixty fucking minutes about the kinder , gentler military -- you will either succeed , quit , or die by my hand !
yes .
join the club .
no , i know what you mean . i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers . least they make sense . sometimes you think they 've betrayed you . like a person would . but then you see , no , you just missed a step . you can go back and make it all work .
should we be worried about this guy ? is n't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying ?
what is the matter with him ?
yes , what kind of arrangement ? i 'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have .
a benedictine .
i think you 're full of shit .
are you sure ?
why 'd you let me in ?
i 'll bet .
it 's okay . she scrambled the transmission . luther , continue feeding the gps her position .
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out . i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down .
i 'm thirty-four .
yeah , well ... could n't be helped .
you sly bastard . you 're doing this to spite me , are n't you !
to oz ?
but , ted , the invitations have already gone out .
there 's ways around that .
chow , chow , chow ! god damn it -- nutriment !
no , that 's his other one .
eh , yes , ma 'm .
dawn ! dawn !
i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property .
yeah , i 'm sorry , but that 's the way it is .
i 'll tell you what happens if you lose ... you tell the truth for once .
but there are eighteen patients on the ward , mister mcmurphy .

they used hounds on us in ireland , it 's the only way !
claire ?
roger .
i 'm not leaving without that tape .
what is it ?
they would n't have changed the security setup .
but i like that one , scottie .
lan 's to goodness , what happened to that hen ? did you use that beanshooter again ?
negative copy on that , pham , check your frequency . i 'm on forty-nine .
you must move away from the center .
and here 's your goddamn severance !
montgomery , why do they call you `` flea '' ?
arline decision . supreme court .
find the father . that should clear things up .
if i get antsy i 'll kill a few small animals .
very good , joe . now , belinda , i 've got a figure over here , of one million , five . i ...
oh , this one you love ? what about the first one , the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space ? you did n't love her ?
everything is lovely , ted , but much too expensive .
he only shot you once .
pardon me ?
knock it off , gerald .
how often do you use cocaine ?
huh ?
what do you want ?
what about juno ?
well , one thing i suppose , but i do n't think it has anything to do with this . a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill .
i warn you , i can yell awfully loud .
something like thirty-six .
mom , lots of people are separated and divorced .
and what 's that ?
the point is that i do n't think napoleon will sit in moscow until the spring ! i do n't think he can afford to .
yeah , i did want to go on tv . that way i have a forum . i can fight back . i 'm known . people see me . they know they ca n't fuck around with me like they could if i was an unknown . that 's right .
how many pills were in that bottle ?
i know ! you ca n't understand , because we 're different , violet . we 're different .
what are you talking about ?
tell me what everyone does n't know .
i will not betray my country . no . ne-ver !
so , let me get this straight . you came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you .
no -- look , i 'm in a hurry .
i think i understand , mr. rogers , but i wonder if -
but it 's a nightmare ! mother superior is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture !
no ... not like this ...
my dear friend , it would be my greatest pleasure .
kid , you were terrific . max reiss , novelty acts . was that judo or something ? ah , skip it . question is , can you do it again ?
you threatening me ?
what ?
well , he missed !
you 're late .
i ca n't take him .
so , you 've had a little bad luck .
oh , uh , i do n't know . i miss you . tsch .
i do n't hafta trust her , i know her .
about one to five years worth .
i know .
children ai n't gon na need to know that kind of thing .
where you gon na be ?
for me ?
you a preacher ?
what other bunch ?
we 'll ground her , clip her wings a bit . school and scheduled activities and that 's it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . dan kelly , in the district attorney 's office , will probably help us out , quietly . christ , this could be embarrassing .
father , there 's something else i need to talk to you about .
where 'd you learn to do that ?
yes . i 've seen that done .
tell 'er to go to hell anyway !
oh , come on , shirl , how 'd you think we got such a good deal ? listen - all old houses have stories .
sabotage ? i do n't understand ...
what about the other night . what about last night ? was that to get to know your character ?
you . you 're the same . no matter where you go , there you are . always the same old you . let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself . i know it sounds wild , but it 's the latest thing in travel . we call it an `` ego trip '' .
the fresh tuna ? ..
i hear you have a new play for the curtain .
what did you come back for ?
gentlemen , i have a plan . it 's called blackmail . the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world . either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money , or we make it look like prince charles , the heir to the throne , has had an affair outside of marriage and , therefore , they would have to divorce .
before we do this .
how long have you been having them ?
eight stories .
you see , that 's worse .
you 'd better coast through ...
i 'm impressed . but let 's use the short form . i 'm looking for --
in america they 'd bring only a penny . i guess that 's about all they 're worth .
great . thank you .
caesar , maybe we should run --
hey , baby ... nothing . what are you doing ... ? yeah , i 'll probably cut out early ...
home .
it 's a beautiful thing .
that 's exactly what you said last week .
-- c'mon , i 'll get you home ...
i bit the bastard 's nose off .
that 's predictable . when i find a queen in need of protection i 'll let you know .
no .
baltimore . pure city-dweller .
then leave .
excuse me , sir . would you like some coffee before we serve dinner ?
objection !
good , wait here , it will not take long and then you may go .
it 's nothing too hard or anything . i 'm just going to ... look for someone , and ... i want you to be sort of a ... guard . okay ?
bye .
the capitol dome ! lighted up !
that 's harry 's place , is n't it ?
what you got that 's good to eat ?
if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there 's quite a collection down in the pagoda . i 'll see you get a proper tour .
nice house . did n't expect you to answer . you must be one of those entertainers . what team you play for ?
that 's right ...
what do you think ?
are you playing tricks on me ?
did you see that shit ? motherfucker . you let in fucking screech , dude ? i 'm waiting and you let in screech ?
look at her face . a real bitch .
three for three .
look , it is n't proof , okay ? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet , but we found it as a vapor in cosgrove 's clothes .
i 'd be able to see something .
jason ? ... i do n't think the pig lizard was gorignak ...
hey teach ! this rock 's starting to freeze ! get your ass back hre !
the only mistake is that they did n't kill us in the elevator .
layaway shmayaway .
the radio rig is inside . it runs directly from the geothermal generator , so power should n't be a problem .
why , you might ask ? because you 're ready . because you 've finally gone as far as you can go without it .
give it up ! just give it up .
no . i just got ta go find him .
boyfriend ?
i 'm sorry , i do n't know what that was .
landon . we 've lived with this for over a year now and --
are you okay ?
she thinks you 're a bucket of dog vomit . trust me on this .
okay . `` dance music for old people ? ''
what-
no , no . you 're her best friend .
she 's sending a message . meth lab . trailer park . anything with interesting antenna arrays ... ?
an implausible idea . between you and me , no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth .
things worked out . i made some money over there , had some laughs , you know . it was good .
what the hell is this ?
if it 's a suicide , i seen weirder , jim .
do n't ! you 're making me lose my grip .
will you shut up ! ? ! !
our numbers are through the roof . the ipo 's tracking at fifty , sixty a share . the bank 's five times oversubscribed --
you take what people say and make it ugly . you make others believe what you want them to . she should have been found guilty . she should n't have gotten off .
hey , lou .
well there 's a few choice lps in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff .
this luke was a pretty good guy , was n't he ?
look at yourself , joe , no offense , but frankly , you 're beginning to smell . for a stud in this town that 's a handicap .
good . good man . alright , let 's finish up here , and take him in for interrogation .
sorry , it 's this thing with blake . i mean , you do n't really think anyone 's out to get us -- do you ?
it 's a little more serious than that , bill . the stockholders have requested a meeting . they want our guarantee that this will never happen again . some of them are even calling for ted 's resignation .
you did .
no , this is < u > pleasure < /u > ...
shit , that was fast .
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones !
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective . they hang you for that , rico .
that 's right . they want something ... dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you 're the one to see .
what about the guy on the very bottom ?
every valuable item in the house was on that list .
carlton insisted on leaving with her . maybe he got lucky .
are we leaving ?
can i tell you something personal ? i feel like i can . it 's something i could n't tell john . or would n't , anyway .
the ladder ?
... i understand ...
no , serial killer , wisconsin in the fifties . he was an interesting guy .
... is that all you want ... ? ... to watch me ... ?
klingons ... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia ! ! they seem to be more than just images ...
bible truth .
i ought to belt you one , j.p .
if mulwray was murdered , she was probably one of the last people to see him .
sure . you see , i 'd never had a gun in my hand before and i did n't know what to do with it . well , when i get stuck , i know that there 's an answer for everything in production for use . so it came to me in a flash : what 's a gun for ? to shoot ! so i shot . simple is n't it ?
i like frank . he 's a good boy . me and him 's made friends .
no .
then i began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now ? the war had just ended , and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act . a small minority thought that england was really theirs , they had made it , they owned it . the rest , the wage earners , were foreigners , outsiders intent on wrecking it all .
defensive pattern kirk epsilon . geordi , get those shields online .
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
you did n't grab her and try to kiss her ?
that is not true . they have tried to help me .
can i ask you something ?
what are you talking about ?
they ought to be .
no . i never did , either .
who 's the other one ?
that , i suppose , makes everything梪h梣uite all right .
shall we ?
go open the video store .
got ta light the scene better . now it 's more moody ... like a scene from the third man .
you 're breaking my ribs !
i said stop it .
oh , yeah ? so do you . oh , god , whatta- whatta dumb thing to say , right ? i mean , you say it , `` you play well , '' and right away ... i have to say well . oh , oh ... god , annie . well ... oh , well ... la-de-da , la-de- da , la-la .
hey , cobb ... man , why do n't you take off your shirt and pants , man ? you should do that wearing what you 're going to wear at the beach .
oh , jesus h. christ !
yeah , i 'm gon na make you rich , bud fox . i 'm gon na make you rich enough you can afford a girl like darien . remember , power is the best aphrodisiac . this is your wake-up call . go to work .
eight and a half .
captain who ?
suppose he 's holding a grudge ?
he pulled back his arms and blam , i landed right on the floor . i picked myself up , tears in my eyes , and he looked at me and he said , son , do n't ever trust anybody . anybody .
i got both rooms on either side of us , so we do n't got ta worry about eavesdropping assholes . how 's that feel ? you okay ?
charley wade .
otto ! you and one of those other fellows ! come help professor darcey .
no , baby ... i 'm glad you 're coming tonight .
some fucker 's shootin ' at us .
egypt ?
you know a gal named maya ? works at the hitching post ?

help me get in the truck .
now you 'll be mine , cindy .
every fuse in my nervous system has been blown .
hey .
nothing .
where are we ?
i ca n't
he hired you to build this place ?
now , we 'll walk over so there 's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes . i can stall if it 's more , but i need time to find a good window , alright ?
sean -- you 're not real .
oh god , laura .
oh , rekall .
is it ?
i 'm here for the same reason you are , so let 's do it .
this footage will work in your favor . when the jury sees this - no matter what cutler tries , they 'll convict him .
gwen ?
`` oh then , dear saint , let lips do what hands to : they pray : grant thou , lest faith turn to despair . ''
we 'll get the paramedics ...
so what are we supposed to do ?
have to find him first .
you 're getting obvious .
do max cherry and jackie brown know each other ?
stop it ! i 've had enough of your sermons ! you act as if you created the world !
one way , or round trip ?
yeah . kidnapping .
they 're tight .
we 'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side .
i 'm sorry .
well , we 're not in the middle of nowhere , but we can see it from here .
i ca n't believe this is happening .
i heard his voice as clear as day . i better get back . maybe something is wrong .
right .
well , those are the breaks .
i want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows . i 'll ask worf to delay his return to ds9 so he can join us . we 're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the goren system .
it 'll be more than that .
okay .
maybe . maybe not .
you americans ! you are the craziest people ! that 's why i like you ! i wish i could invite you all to my house for a nice german christmas !
cute .
she said to me , i love the way you talk on the radio .
it 's an apartment .
i thought he was carrying something .
i think it 's gon na be a waste of time .
we are not comrades any more ... we are friends , ninotchka .
how do you sort it -- by lace and cotton ?
commes des garcon .
you all right , nolan ?
you just did .
how long till the room fills ?
i call myself phoebe .
no ! you can not know that !
you want a name from the present ? how about hazel dobkins ?
i 'm going to have to front you personally . do n't lose that money without losing your life .
what ? what are you talkin ' about ?
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor , jack . like a true prince ... a champion !
if i had known --
what did jeffrey 's dad say ?
where 's the sphere ?
what is it ? what 's the matter ?
mine ?
the broad has disappeared ...
no , kringelein , not tired , -- just -- well -- well --
tell me something ... what 's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville ? i mean , this is not the place for fine dining , unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite .
and it stinks to high heaven in here .
oh , yeah .
it is . yes -- that 's where they had rorish , for god 's sake , before they made him anchor . i ca n't stand it -- they 're grooming you for it all and you do n't even know it .
passion .
i wo n't panic .
good reasons ?
pardon me , m'sieu . madame colet would like to see you in the living room .
do you think they 're cannibals ?
you and your bene gesserit sisterhood ... i 'm not your kwisatz haderach ... i 'm something different , something unexpected ! i 'm a seed . i am so much more ... you do n't begin to know me ...
nothing ... i should never have left him ...
no , uh , nobody . it 's , uh , it 's my birthday this week and sooze 's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday .
in that respect , you are exceedingly fortunate . we are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now ?
were you vacationing in los angeles ?
... this close ...
thanks . take care -
welcome to public school , my friend .
let me see it .
man , ever since old jack grendel died , julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other . not only am i producing , he 's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position . what are you looking at ...
shhh ...
i 'm sure we will .
this time get your feet set .
yeah .
how are you going to fight this ? maybe if oleg had n't gotten away and you 'd been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . you 'd have the good to weight against the bad ! it 's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there 's nothing i can do ! gim me your shield .
just moved in with his girlfriend .
nobody knows you have anything to do with this case ; nothing has been on tv or the news ... why would he want to get in < u > your < /u > computer ?
is it an ongoing case ?
i 'm sorry , i --
a soap ?

out . i 've got things to do .
well , i 'm glad to hear that .
they 're waiting for us ... but let 's keep this dream stuff between you and me .
yeah , why ?
well , they 're gon na be asking a lot of questions . about us . about those bodies . about the gold . seems like we oughta be prepared is all .
you 're gon na be okay , toby ... you are ... we 'll getcha fixed up ...
i 'd sooner wait outside .
i wish somebody would tell me i 'm gon na live long enough for it to be a habit . my parent , she 'll be okay . my husband , he 'll be okay . i even know who the bum is gon na marry . terrific . she 'll take good care of him .
you 're right , let 's knock it down .
once time 's up , de-miniaturization begins . in a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system . then white corpuscles will swarm to destroy it , as they would any invader .

okay , tee 's the asshole , but mikey 's the big winner .
then where is everybody ? i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house . we ai n't got the slightest fuckin ' idea what happened to mr. blonde or mr. blue . they could both be dead or arrested . they could be sweatin ' 'em , down at the station house right now . yeah they do n't know the names , but they can sing about this place . i mean , that could be happening right now . as we speak , the cops could be in their cars , drivin ' here this minute .
then you do n't wan na work hard ?
well , the line 's growing weaker , little brother . lucky for us there are n't any dragons left to slay .
where to ?
can you believe thirty bucks for this room ... for what ? a lumpy mattress , that crummy tv and a crapper .

you crave what i might show you . what you can learn . what i can give you . so much more than michael can .
you 've got to have the right ladder for the job . you do n't know what you 're doing , you can get yourself in trouble .
we 've been making progress , i see .

this could be it !
i bet we can fix it .
we was by the river ? and i hear my friend callin ' for help , and i look and she has falling in the water --

one of you would end up dead .
john book , i would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with samuel as possible .
humped
those girls were asking questions . they 've got it rough . i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age . i wish somebody would talk to me about it now .
you know very well who it is that i love .
you 're tougher .
i 'll drop a cow on the knave !
you 're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you .

i just came from a meeting ... i ca n't talk about it now , baby . but in a few days -- see i 'm disgusted with my life .
okay .
you do ? !
then , you should have left two days ago , because i have men willing to help me today .
but to be candid , father , a prolonged future does n't excite me . it would have to have a point . i 've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any . and if that is so , then long life must be even more pointless . no , i 'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on .
well , what do we do ? we drove all the way out here .
it takes all types .
thanks , reverend . thank you both for tipping me off . you do n't know a captain forrest or a captain pierce , do you ?

i just hope you do n't consider her a close friend .
there 's a furnace .
quite right !
there 's now a problem with the weather for pickup . there 's a typhoon in our sector ... ... we 're going to be delayed twelve hours ...
i 'll be okay . holy shit ...
okay . i 'll flip you for it .
of course , it 's just for us to verify your credit card information . it 's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as d & d mattress man .
would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
my dad . no question .
in manhattan ?
mister powell ?
six to eight months . that 's with treatment . -- perhaps now you can see why it 's so vital that we locate your . . . friends .
jack , do n't !

i do n't know , but i can think about it , a lot .
before you pop too many buttons , do n't forget to make out that check for a thousand .

i 'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances .
... one moment , mr. concannon ...

that 's right -- one with high yield , rich assets and no downside ...
these men you up under . how you let them do ya like that ?

she got two of them .
jacques , help me get her home . now !
i guess we are .

well , you know what that would do to me .
yeah , it 's not bad . usually ann has some serious salt action going . i keep telling her , you can always add more if you want , but you ca n't take it out .
it was n't professional , jack . it was a stunt . a stupid-ass stunt .
that 's why you 're really here . i knew it from the start .
the energizer 's bypassed like a christmas tree -- so do n't give me too many bumps .

well , put 'er there , billy boy , my name 's mcmurphy .
-- i know , i know , the pressure 's off the white house and it 's all back on the post --
julie , you left four messages ... four .
edvard said the same thing about you before he died .
there is nothing to discuss-
that 's all right , doc . do n't worry .
she used to call me mr. right . remember that , buddy ?
back off , burt ... !
tell me about it .
goodnight , doctor .
uh , how did this personality come about ?

but do you mean in ? ... but you just told him that if worse comes to worse ...
mary , the man 's a killer .
shut the fuck up , donny . not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin ' to find reverse on a soviet tank . this is not a worthy --
how come you 're not at sal 's ?
maybe if you saw a good doctor ...
you mean you had a bad dream .
pry the thing open ? what are we -- neanderthals ?
mrs. hillyer , this girl is sick in more ways than one . she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses . it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others . therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary . it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me .
some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time , randle , and will b b-be here long after this wo-wo world series of yours is oh-oh-oh , what 's the use anyway ...
i do n't believe it .

your mistake was n't making something fake , daddy . we 're fine with fake -- as long as you do n't lie about it .
john and cynthia have been ... `` fucking '' .
because you always obey orders ...
well , the hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants . some will be butterflies . others will be elephants or creatures of the sea .
what are you doing ?
who do you think i am ?
no thank you .
yeah , i have to help my father .
you 're the only person i can trust .
you know , your daughter seems ...
were you working for him last night ?
he needs me here .
i like all varietals . i just do n't generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation .
was this during betty ?
you do n't want to believe it . it 's a normal reaction .
working ? what do you mean , working ? i 'm walking .
yes , sir .
miller . thought the guy was made of depleted uranium . really did n't expect to lose him .

yeah , little election party i 'm giving at the bistro . it 's a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it . we 'll have a little time to talk there .
yeah , but it was okay .
what 's he like ?
we 're doing a check on the manufacturers' serial number , see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch . what 's your take on these local boys ? are they providing any answers ?
did you hear that , terrance ? i farted !
not who . a data bank . just keep your ear to the phone and do n't make a sound .
holy shit .
we 're not dropping it . now that 's the reason , is n't it ? i 'm a dirty degenerate , are n't i ? i 'm not fit to --
that 's absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
far from it .
yeah . sergeant jack vincennes requesting . i need the home address on a pierce patchett .
just safety your shit and get behind me , okay ? i 'll take care of this .
there are rules , boy , procedures , etiquette . this is not a toy . i 've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room , grooming myself , quietly setting the stage , performing ablutions , paying tribute , seeing all his motion pictures again and again . worshipping , schwartz , worshipping properly .
you look great . hey , mare , do i have a rip in the back of these pants ?
what do you mean ?
i wo n't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you , but hey , good job . shall we ?
you dog ! i did n't see you go back there .
yeah , i love it there .
how soon can it be altered ?
yes , ma'am . but my name is adam .

i 'll say .
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people ?
this would be a bad time for me to leave .

i think i 've seen this nut somewhere . have n't i ?

i know you ! what can this possibly mean to anyone who does n't `` need '' meaning - `` who goes with the mystery '' -- who pretends he is n't scared to death .
lane oil ...
we 'll see what we can do .
but everybody 's heard of him , he won the congressional medal of honor , he saved a dozen men .

grace : get mr. white a typewriter .
you 're damn right . but the first time you say anything about this , to anybody -- you 'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life . what 's your name ?
yeah , kenneth , why you have to do that to that poor girl .
`` if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic , then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men , just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads . but ... ''

you would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun ?
what were you doing up there ?

dago , wop , garlic-breath , guinea , pizza-slinging , spaghetti-bending , vic damone , perry como , luciano pavarotti , sole mio , nonsinging motherfucker .
one-two-three , swing .

well , tomorra you 'll get in a full day -- full day 's pay -- an ' we 'll have plenty .
did you say group 7 access ?
i do n't know if i should talk about this .
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank .
i thought you said you were doing to break it off .
congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and can not pay the soldiers pensions .
where are you from ?
why then , sam , do n't you act like this is a job like any other ? surely , if you are a hired gun , you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for .
i think i 'd better choose the menu . after all , you 're learning how to be me , i 'm not learning how to be < i > you < /i > .
and she 'll fight back again . god help me , what have i done .
okay , now you listen to me ! i do n't know what 's going on but you 'd better fix it ! i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear !
smugglers maybe .
i 'm sorry , i did n't --
not yet , jeff .
now wait ...
we were , we are , but this is perfect for you .
what ?
so is the town , i notice !
buddy , you would n't tell nobody , would you ?
and deep down i 'm a good person ? make no mistake , dewey , i 'm a shit .
listen , i do n't want you to think i 'm ungrateful -- i know you and that little broker -- what do you call him ?
that is logical . you may procede .
yeah . nice .
uh huh ... one point seven . and what do you project for this year ?
what is it . tammy ?
someone like me , like you . a pro .
no , it was n't pam grier , pam grier was the other one . pam grier made the movies . christie love was like a pam grier tv show , without pam grier .
she 's working on another lead right now .
check every hotel in l.a. start with the ones near the airport . yeah . he 's about to leave the country with her . thanks , lar .
the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now .
what are they for ?
i did n't know . i just said all i want is some time .
i do n't like to assert myself , dave , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you 've been involved in a very stressful situation .
marquis ? is that you ?
first of all , basement sales like tonight are n't gon na last much longer . it 's too risky , one , and two , everything 's going on the internet . anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants . it 's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks . they 're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em . but , there 's still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes . no one knows where it comes from . that 's local underground , where information spreads by word of mouth . those are zombies , hardcore junkies . their hands are permanently pruned . they go out in the sun they do n't burn , they blister . other than that , all i know about is the mail . classified ads in the paper with hidden codes . secret couriers . credit card orders to dummy corporations . interstate wire transfers . revolving p.o . boxes . but , if you 're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit ... who knows ? that 's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible , and vice versa , and cops ca n't trace the deal . there 's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is .
adam ... do n't forget ... do n't forget ...
where are you bound for ?
holy shit .
rose . rose dewitt bukater .
she 'll need both of us .
they 're making him a hero now .
i empathize with your plight , fletch . however , you threw her out .
sorry .
what 's wrong with my face ? you want to know what 's wrong with my face ? i 've got a skin condition . next question , bob ? no more questions ? fine . now can you help me find the complaint ?
of course there is , jack . what do you think the crusades were - a frat initiation ? i do n't think so ... there has to be a grail .
i know exactly where i want to go , and when . back to that mountaintop on veridian iii , before soran put out the star . i have to stop him .
it 's not optional !
i just washed this shirt , did n't i ?
cheers . bones , these are ... charming .
oh , flowers ! i did n't know you were so traditional .
had the boys follow us .
oh wow . look at you .
i thought everything was arranged .
he does n't look like he 's going anywhere , bill . and if necessary , i can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private .
me , i 'm riding along , minding my own business . four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while , friendly as can be . i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody 's your friend or nobody is ... do n't make much difference . we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody 's pointing their gun but me . i guess they admired my horse . she 's a great one , a sweet little bay .
then you took her upstairs and you raped her .
i must go .
get going , rick ... you 're late enough as it is .

saavik ... is ... david with you ?
there was an unavoidable delay .
i 'm sorry .

what happened to the singing ? you 're not in a show , are you ?
< u > lugosi < /u > ? ? ! did n't be pass on ?
can we have it by tonight ?
then do you propose to arrest all of us , citizen lieutenant ? for i was not there alone .
junior who ?
is this true , brother buyl ?
you know , miles , after my wife -- wife 's mastectomy -- things were never the same . this might sound cold , well , maybe not to you , massey , but ... i like my women with two boobs .
not to be crass , but what do we get out of this ?
they 're fine ... you miss it ?
not the whole thing , truman . you were right about one thing .
look , you 'll be back in town tomorrow night . we 'll have dinner -- talk it over .
bear right till the fire road ends . it 's not far .
with all due respect , sir , maybe you should give them this one . your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail stravanavitch .
then where the fuck is !
i 'm not going to let him get away with murder .
no .
you wanted to tussle , we tussled .
you seem pretty sure of that .
does n't say -- it 's just these pages .
hi . what are you doing ?
they live here , used to be like us . but after too many silicon implants , their muscles turned to jelly . the only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again . snake , nobody who comes into beverly hills gets out alive .
you told him . i 'm fucking hurting here .
that 's it ?
you eat like a bird .
why are we so successful ?
exactly . so ... logically ...
i 'm glad you guys came by ... what 's the occasion ?
where were you last night around nine ?
ah , you should see the swan ! his masterpiece . now , walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell .
just a thought --

so do n't marry him .
nothing .
anywhere but here .
then what happened ?
it beets being on the mainland .
get real , z ! she just dropped the scarf by accident !
how many rounds did you find for that weapon ?
it 's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years . many believe that is a matter collapser , a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds .
a hired player no longer . fifty pounds , will , for the poet of true love .
i could come back then .
joseph harbin 's body was found in the coffin .
keep them coming .
yeah . summer vacation . thought i 'd travel some . maybe write a little bit .
what do you want me to say ? that i 'm not attracted to him ?

until she rots and lie stinking in the earth .
you think he 's getting out of here ?
is n't it ? is n't it ! you know i was a professor for twenty years ? - and a very good one .

daphne , you 're bothering us .
not too far . my folks bought a place over on elm street .

you 're such a good friend .
you always take his side because he 's a cripple ! well , it 's not my fault that he 's a cripple !
that 's pat verona ? the one who was gone for a year ? i heard he was doing porn movies .

i 've got you floored ... we 're off ... take the curb ... man , can you corner ... know not to get on it ... momentum shift ... do n't get on those brakes too hard ... get her up on her tires . up on her toes . up ... up ... up .

i promise we 're gon na get away from him . the time has to be right , that 's all . i 'd rather him get tired of me and leave me . then he would n't want to hurt me . he would n't care then . we 'll be fine . i promise . you go to bed now . i love you .
when are you leaving ?
it 's time to go home , holly .
the time ... is short .
you must do me this honor ... promise me you will survive ... that you will never give up ... no matter what happens ... no matter how hopeless ... promise me now , and never let go of that promise .
my first husband worked for the bbc . i doubt if anyone there remembers him now , just another long dead diligent administrator . he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc 's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about . i became involved too . i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez . then he died , and i loots the will to write it . by the time i was over his death , other books had been published , and it was n't worth going on .
it would kill you , huh ?
get `em ready . you ... come with me .
you can send me the address too .
it 's because of jacqueline 棗 i ca n't go on looking for her --

we could call it `` quit bugging me , sunny . '' get it ? sunny . s-u-n-n-y .
are you saying my mother had another husband ?
peace , everybody -- paul , penelope .
maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
what do you suggest ?
now you must listen to me . this force is like a parasite , or a virus . it feeds on doubt , suspicion , discord ... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her .
wait for the wind ! wait and hear the birds sing over you !
what is it ?
hold on just a little longer , shirley .
i 'm not here very much .
no , i mean you , right now . not it you were somebody else .
now , now . do n't get exasperated . i realize that you 've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men , and i might add , you 've been wise . heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage . for men , marriage is a matter of efficient logistics : the male gets his food , bed , laundry , tv , pussy , offspring and creature comforts all under one roof , where he does n't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much , then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life , which is what existence is all about . but for a woman marriage is surrender .
we want to talk to you .
mm-hm .
-- otherwise we may have to --
have it your way . we 'd both be better off dead now .
sir ?
serves me right for asking a direct question . the subject is closed .
your butter money ?
nothing would please me more .
here comes your father , tell him so yourself .
tomorrow ?
only about three months . eh we 're from vermont . my husband was teaching school there .
you coming to party tonight , ostreicher , ya fuckface ?
is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble ? ?
then you wo n't like this one . it 's a piece of shit .
excuse me .
i see them , prof. everywhere . they 're invading my life .
too bad for her if she 's not around .
thanks ...
they said you were dead . they said ...
that 's kind of ... extreme , walt . andy 's private life is none of our business .
i 'd like to go now , rand . would you mind taking me home ?
very well .
what 's left of my blood .
it 's okay ... you 're going to be okay .
you going out ?
i 'm never going back !
why ? i like spending time with you . you know , you 're quite attractive for a woman your age . you have killer legs . killer .
if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you .
well , i just wondered 'cause being from out or town i would n't be able to make anything .
j.j. , i swear to you on my mother 's life , i wo n't do it . if you gave me your column i would n't do a thing like that ...
her temperature is a hundred and four .
where did you come from ?
what is real ? how do you define real ? if you 're talking about your senses , what you feel , taste , smell , or see , then all you 're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain .
your honor , i 'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at ? mrs. kramer , were you a failure at the longest , most important personal relationship in your life ?
you cool the broad out ?
i ... uh ... that was n't me , it was samuel ... i mean nathan ...
if he continues having these outbursts , i 'll have to have him isolated permanently .
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin ' , but nobody 's gon na pay good money for a cut-up whore .
i 'm sorry , i ... i do n't have a desk in my room , and ...
i stick my neck out for nobody .
this guy is messing with the wrong teenagers !
a fucking moron .
long story .
morgan , be careful .
then we need to figure out what happened to you . it 's the only thing we can do .
i passed out .
the wizard - the wizard - the great and powerful wizard of oz - oz - oz-oz - oz - oz - oz - oz !
come on , daphne .
i love you . i love you and i 'm sick . i'ii talk to you ... .i 'll talk to you tommorrow . i 'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow . for my teeth . for my teeth and for you ... .for you so we can speak . you have braces . me too . me too . i 'm getting braces , too . for you . for you , dear brad . and i do n't have any money . and i do n't have any money now but i'ii get it ... i will for you , brad . i love you , brad . brad the bartender . you wan na love me back ? love me back and i 'll be good to you . i'ii be god damn good for you . and i wo n't be mad if you do n't know who said what . i wo n't punish you if you get the answer wrong . i can teach and tell you : samuel johnson .
what are you going to see ?
i have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point . i 've tried to pare down my collection to the essential ...
but , kurt , i ...
`` save yourself . from hell . '' what are you saying , are you saying that this ship is possessed ?
i 'm not sure , but if you do n't want to find out , you better get out of there .
i 'm your man .
enough though , eh ?
want to take a poke at him ?
... and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster . to kill the legacy ! you are the sum of his desires -
what d'you think i mean , kitten ? i forgot , that 's what i mean .
none at this time , sir .
i know that .
... you 're not gon na screw me on this ?
san juan ! you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo .
i 'm sorry i got you into this .
i figured i 'd get , uh , frederick and dusty together .
yeah well , they want a lot for their money . they want a felony , preferably with `` violent intent . '' we 've got to give them something . they 'll kill me if i do n't . and the panthers are going to kill me if i do . i 'm scared .
yeah ? ? well orson welles did n't wear angora sweaters , did he ? ? !
not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years , on his death bed -
i try to be .
i could be up for that . i 've already started underlining < u > meaningful < /u > passages in heather 's copy of catcher in the rye , if you know what i mean . so are we on ?
i do n't . and i 'm not going to try .
on average forty million .
maybe there 's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours . say that you 'll do it for me and my friend , mr. fettes , here .
joe !
what did you do with her ?
al , are you doing anything in there ?
now take deep breaths , and push .
yeah . and i 'll tell you who we 're going to want : kumar banijamali .
no , walter ! i said i thought she kidnapped herself ! you 're the one who 's so fucking certain --
i 'm late for surgery .
it 's gino ! it 's gino !
you have to what ?
how many in your family ?
jennifer 's only ever had one visitor .
hell naw , willie . them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo ' brain !
you miserable little tripe-hound . i 'm the one who should be fed up , sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school .
william : you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed .
... show me the wallet , man , get your ass up , < u > up < /u > ...
i want to know where i come from . the remans gave me a future . you can tell me about my past .
maybe even my destiny .
this is n't the junior chamber of commerce brad .
that 's not what i heard .
he could n't have checked out -- i was supposed to meet him here .
i mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place ?
no-gah-buh- no ! rule number two - no names ! no goddamn names , you retard !
i 'm at marker eight-five .
president kennedy threatened to smash the cia into a thousand pieces . you could do the same ...
just do it , old man .
hey , do n't pull away till they see the car .
yeah , get me a glass of bourbon , a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser .
i 've arranged for him to work with us .
... i made a reservation at ...
marriage is happy news .
just take it , ok .
huh ?
so you lied to her ?
shit , shit , shit , shit . my car 's gone !
madam grusinskaya 's car is not to be brought .
i never heard of it .
and i do n't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not , crow horse , but i did n't cut you .
it 's remarkable , doctor . the patients are so subdued ; so docile .
so , blocker , what do you think of our boy ?
this could be it .
sure , we got ta have a spy . if we no got a spy who 's gon na tell the other side what we 're doing ?
and the third one ?
why ? it 's not dinner time yet .
not quite . just visiting . i live in lincoln park now .
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice , do n't you think ?
who do they think i am ? !
i have no answers . thanks for the stain . find the girl . in the envelope are tickets to the dorothy chandler . we 'll chat again , then .
the new queen lives .
carter 枛 bank examiner .
you should see the one we wear when it rains .
i 've never met a human woman .
run , anya - go ...
two vehicles . they 're not supposed to be here .
i 'm here . shut up .
joey dorsey ? perma-shit-grin . i wish i could say he 's a moron , but he 's number twelve in the class . and a model . mostly regional stuff , but he 's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out .
he 's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay ! they 're going to be shooting at him !
what did you call me , mayo ?
how are you feeling , fernando ?
i should 've said renaissance , right ? it went over her head .
basic equipment . you do n't leave it behind in your husband 's drawer in your favorite handbag .
people can be kinder than you think .
i 've said i 'm sorry about the old woman , but from the behind you looked ...
why not ?
no . do that and i guarantee you 'll scare him off . i do n't want him running away .
i had n't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance . mass hysteria is like a story , nell . a communal story . someone starts it . then we all add a little more to it . and then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it . this story shapes what we see and hear . we interpret everything through it , make it fit the story . i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house . you 've added to it . that 's what this experiment has all been about . that 's what it was about , the experiment 's over . i 'm pulling the plug . this is my fault .
they 're comin ' with us .
you 're going to drive me crazy !
what girl ?
the question is what are you going to make next , walter ? did you make that dog yet , or that parakeet ? how about making something out of the cockroaches in your room ?
i do n't want a goddamn cup of tea . i want to go home .
we all expect the world to be fair . as if we have some right t ...
it 's the questions she asks .
barry , you 're over thirty years old . you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey .
yeah ?
they 're gon na lynch him !
well , she 's running now , too . these fucking people like to run , do n't --
mrph mprph ! !
honey chili had a point . you know , i can remember plays about women - even from the south - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers ...
sam ! what happened ! ? you had me scared to death . are you all right ?
... yeah .
back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of sheila .
what i do n't understand is how you got here .
who was that ?

what are you doing ?
hi , mary . how 's it going ?
yup . claire ... please , please tell mr. bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life , we 'd make a lot better movies .
he just did the gettysburg address in sioux . what did he say ?
i understand . maybe we 'll see each other after the show ...
... i mean , she knows all the music , and pop stars , and clothes and stuff . she 's like still a kid , herself .
and spock with it . they are joined together .
what id we run into someone i know ?
why do n't you talk to mr. keating about it ?
what *else* could i have showed you , homer ? the only thing i can teach you is what i know ! in every life , you 've got to be of use .
where 's jack ?
do n't you really want to know ? was jake my daddy ? was i fucking my own daddy ? do n't you want to know that ?
lieutenant , are you sure it 's them ? maybe i should see the ... bodies .
yeah .
i think one of us should fuck josh ...
huh ? , sir .
a big legal war was n't going to improve anybody 's situation . we 've all been through enough . besides i was raised better than that . thanks for having us , dad .
and give a deposition to the judge .
she was n't your type anyway .
dartmouth 's too big and too expensive . if he 's as good as i think he is , he can move into the big league later . but androscoggin first .
no , seriously , if you 're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot , they give you free shit .
so , bill , if i understand this right , you currently have your penthouse floor under construction ?
the king said you 're his finest archer ... ?
nguyen . he twelve now . not see him for eight years .
there 's not much illegal .
i told you it 's real .
i love the way you 've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece . is that the way it 's done in most houses ?
do n't threaten me , bob .
miller , do you read me , peters --
i could try and get a western lawyer .
he 's well-trained . he 'll behave himself .
it 's that lsd und his verdampter babies ! ...
because he 's doing just what he said he 'd do . he 's coming for us .
what 're you talkin ' about ?
okay , bone-setter brown goes . here , sign it . meanwhile , here 's fifty dollars for spending money . that 's fine . beany !
i 'm glad .
yeah . i just saw him outside . maybe the robins are here .
there 's nothing else for it . take your ground , grogan -- twelve paces , i suppose ?
block e ?
is n't that a little politically incorrect ?
well that ought to be about the end of that .
no . what are you gon na do ?
do n't . do n't be embarrassed . i should never have let you think that ... i am in love with my wife .
i do n't have the problems that artists have .
why do i keep doing this ?
credit ?
oh , is that what this is about ? you want to hear that i do n't really have any brothers ? that i 'm a fuckin ' orphan ? is that what you want to hear ?
you think you 're so smart , mrs. stone . you wanted to be near jabez . it looked like your big chance tonight , but you 're wrong , you ca n't win him back -- not that way .
sure . big beautiful set like this -- you want something that 'll put you right in the show .
one hundred thousand . no ... three hundred thousand .
he thinks you want him to look at evidence .

that day you came over to my place to play doctor ... what was going on there ?
if loomis read memos he 's be here . fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical . my hope is that he 's either transfer , retire , or die .
so , < u > neil < /u > . how 's it goin ' ?
well , he 's holding on to his shit like it was money .
everything about you is the editorial we . take that away from you , and you 'd disappear .
he knows where the eiffel tower is , olsen . you do , do n't you , kent ?
so . what then ? you just detach sex from everything..
all the more reason to go to africa .
i am gon na have to find the others and get you to a doctor . will you look after tim , lex ?
my parents do n't do it anymore .
he died fast . and if we got any choice , that 's the way we should all go out . do n't you cry for johns . do n't you dare .
you 're getting defensive , will .
who won ? how did it end ?
eat your heart out . is annabelle there ?
you got ta be kidding ?

buckaroo ! what the sam hill !
saw you at the truck stop this morning . you 're not from around here .
gobble , gobble , gobble .
are you okay ? ?
you know i am only too happy to be of help to you , but surely this is n't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters .
are you saying this is illegal ?
what the hell ?
the forest is not safe these days . you 'd best travel with us .
yes , but , sir ... if it could be accomplished , would n't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ?
this is a goddamn disaster . let 's just pack it up and go .
but now we 've lost access to craig .
cause i do n't get it .
was he nice to you ?
just because the bastard has a library card , it does n't make him einstein .

we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner ...
when something 's rotten in the land , bill , it generally is n't just one fish , we 'll get corroboration ... find this clay bertrand . if i were a betting man , i 'd give you 10 to 1 it 's an alias . start checking around the quarter .
blue , then .
i leave the answer to god .
dixie mccoy
and the one driving the other car ?
all you got ta do is get in .
it 's very sore .
you do n't listen very good . this break in -- i can call it a felony -- three strikes , and you got about sixteen strikes already , and you 're in jail for the rest of your life , no parole . or i could see it gets forgotten .
i ca n't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist . do you have someone you can stay with tonight ?
oh , jim !
you 'd think i was mad .
i 'm talking with mr. lingk . if you please , i 'll be back in . i 'll be back in a while ... i told you , check with mr. williamson .
no .
what about you , everett ? what 'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place ?
yes . either right now or right when i thought of it . the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me . lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again . because it is only a feeling , i am powerless to stop it . and another thing , albert , when the next murder happens you will help me solve it .
we ca n't climb over that . we 'll break our necks !
mercutio単ood name .
and then what happened ?
i do n't . i was just curious how full of shit you were .

russian , french , italian , spanish , greek , german , a little hindu , some serbo croat and a smattering of swahili ... standard pre-med background ...
no , ed -- what with me running for my life , i did n't have time to check those things --
italian . my mom was irish . i got her ears . but the rest is all wop .
wait a second --

what if i say no ?
cole , that 's very wrong . grandma 's gone . you know that .
very futuristic . yours does n't really go with that butch haircut !
if it looks like i ca n't get back , just close the door .
i have it .
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again . so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you 've found is back again .
oh yes -- that 's right -- look ! i win , do n't i --
ever read any poe ?
okay .
very .
all right , then ...
the west end . we buy it off the streets . i can stop , you know , and she ca n't . two people , really similar , we can talk about anything , but for me it 's like a weekend thing , then i get my shit together , and for her it 's different --
how many bodies , greenly ?
okay , we 're going to try a little group hypnosis .
go on to the house .
of course i have suspected that our being here is no accident . furthermore , i have a feeling that we 're never supposed to leave . but that , for the moment , does n't concern me greatly . i 'll meet that when it comes . what particularly interests me at present is , why was i brought here ? what possible use can i be to an already thriving community ?
your brother was up here the other day . he said you ran away from home .
uh ... c ?
without us , masseria do n't stand a chance , and he knows it .
cold .
what is the meaning of this attack ? where is the crew of the reliant ?

i ca n't thank you enough , i ...
so then she just stops calling .
you 'll see .
do n't they have to be ? ...
how does she like what in bed ?
mary clarence -- you should n't have . where did you get this ?
she 's got to be found . that 's the first step . she 's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police .
good way to get your head blown off .
by way of chicago ?
i think you should wear one at a time . one of these ... and one of your others . in fact , i was going to buy just one , but i did n't think it would fly ... as a gift , i mean .
is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who is n't connected in some war to one of the cartels ?
i 'm working on it .
michael ...
jeffrey ! !
how do you explain slowing pulse , low respiratory rate and coma ?
thank you so much . i love slugs . all slugs , not just banana slugs .

we ai n't gettin ' married with his ring ! you said you 'd changed !
hey . who 'd you say was gon na get him ?
in women ?
i 've tried to stay out of it . but it turns out that 's not so easy , sam . you 've gone and got yourself this lawyer . mitchell stephens . you and risa and wendell and the ottos .
because you 're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
that 's where this chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas . i could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me .
i think he means the kennedy assassination .
ok. he asks about you all the time . it 's been weeks since you 've seen him .
you better believe it , buddy . your average rolls royce does n't have to pass as many tests . you want consistency ? you want dependability ? you want safety ?
johnnie hits on anything in high heels .
pat , i 'm not kidding . i really think it 's the greatest --
well ... there 's one indoors now . i 've brought her back to see you .
what did he want ?
you did n't have to beat him up !
but ... has anyone seen him in london ?
i had you sent away .
of course not . as a matter of fact , it was just the other way around . you see he needs help .
there 's only one alternative to the serum .
and now you live on route 9 in ludlow , and your dad 's gon na be the new doctor up to the college , i hear , and i think you 're going to be just as happy as a clam here , ellen creed .
i do n't want to be in any competition ... i dive because i like to , not to beat a record ... do n't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him ?
castle couer de noir built with magic ... simple as death ... strong as hate ...
becker does ? are you sure ?
what was that ?
you wanted to , or you are ?
well , i would n't go so far as to call him nice , but he 's treated me pretty decent . but i 've only been there about four days . he got a little rough with arlene the other day .
in any state .
not usually this drunk .
pappas , that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer . now , what could he have to do with a military scientist , huh ?
they 're a finesse team ...
stop that .
c'mon , we got nothin ' to fight about .

stevie , how 's it going my man ? somebody get a picture , we can use it for a mug shot .
but you know , that was just a dream . does n't really count .

'if ? ' my , my , my ... the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with < i > chimera < /i > needed it as well .
i know . i have acrophobia . what a disease . a fear of heights . and what a moment to find out i had it .
honestly , the suites are all about the same .
i just want to see the basketball scores . it 's important .
you like to open me . do n't you ?
when you go busting your fists against a stone wall , you 're not using your brains . cause that 's what the white man wants you to do . look at you .
well then what are you trying to do-
what do you mean ?
i will stay here and keep on trying . i 'm sure in a little while --
but if you only went to one meeting , why does anyone care ? besides , why should it even matter if you were a communist ?

he must 've unsealed the room !
the wrong word , maybe . delete that . and , you know , the dog barks incessantly .

he wo n't be a failure !
how does it feel , mank ? going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table ? how does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves -- ? !

what then ? robbery ? extortion ? kidnapping !
i 'm surprised you even knew it was an election year .
they 'll have guns .

what is that ?
and her farmhouse ... ?
computer 's down . septuplets story . i need it back by five . hopefully the copy 's not a mess .

fail safe in lock . four minutes to drop , 22 minutes to detonation . this is sergeant pinback calling bomb # 20. do you read me , bomb ?
'the one ' to do what ?
it 's hard to swallow . the confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing ? it 's more calculated than sick . what about nicky ? she 's the last one to see bourne in paris . she 's the one he asks for . they disappear ...
how can you tell it 's a female ?
what 's it like where i 'm going ?
well , there 's a thing about partners , about being somebody 's partner . you do for each other . and other people 's rules do n't mean shit . it 's the rules set up between the two of you , that 's all that counts . understand ? okay . well , my friend and partner was shot last night and i 'm after the shitbag that did it . as my partner , i 'm asking you to respect me and help me find him .
more nerve than the doctor , i must admit . he has n't been home for two days . has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television -- and the violin ?
no other equipment ? scientific instruments ?
bud -- why did you do this ?
manray !
of course , his eagerness to leave his mother 's womb also meant he was the one selected .
i know what it looks like .
what proposition ?
how a sandman lives .
mu-shu ? you 're hungry ?
spread it out .
man like you ought not take the lord 's name like you just done .

thank you , louis .
oh , you 'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- good morning , dr. fettes .

i 'm sorry , he 's on medication ...
okay . my client pays for it anyway .
oh , johnnie farragut ... do n't you trust your very own marietta ?
forget it , judy .
the man understood me . the woman wanted to be cheap , but the man saw that i was right .
what do you make with that ?
my dear rick , when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy ?
okay ?
love to , sir , but no can do . no spare room . period .
pedro is waiting for me , too .
too late for that sir . give my love to the misses . get those bastards !

there 'll be no vigilante stuff . not while i 'm barrack chief .
i 'm a prisoner in them . until the gunshot sets me free .

look , you cocksucker ...

and you expect to find him in here ? go and ask claudia .
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum .
why do you ask that ?
with a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up ? y'ever read your shakespeare , bill ?
there has n't been a murder in six years . there 's nothing wrong with the system . it 's perfect .
when it is time .
if you 're gon na do it , better do it now .
`` it is my home . ''

-- you the resident here ?
i 'll tell lee . now , jack sparrow has an honest streak in him , and that 's where the whole problem starts . this was when he was captain of the black pearl --

he did n't do you a favor .

i 'm not just bringing anybody -- i 'm bringing miss kubelik .

i wanted you back .
god i admire you .
oh my g-d , they want me to anchor . they want me to anchor tonight !
jesus christ , where 'd that come from ? i have a late lunch by myself and now i 'm fucking somebody ?
you are so good to me . will you also allow me to have a botanical garden ?
someone who knows her well could still identify her , that 's not the problem . it 's just there 's , uh , it 's likely to be a shock .
just what i 've read . that the technology was developed for the feds , to replace the body wire . and now it 's gone black market . so , uh , do i get the deck from you ?
i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth .
everything on it .
how can you say a thing like that about an officer in the united states army ?
thorfinn ! you ca n't die !
oh , yes . you know ryan 's been sober eight years . and it 's difficult if i ... you know . it 's better if i do n't .
something has got to be done or rose is going to be in this house forever .
... did you happen to see the front page of today 's manhattan argus ?
you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .
o god , i have an ill-divining soul . methinks i see thee , now thou art so low , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb . o fortune , fortune . be fickle , fortune , for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back .
i 've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon , when carr gomm meets him . somehow , between now and then i 've got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man ... why am i fooling myself ? nothing short of john delivering the sermon on the mount is going to sway carr gomm ...
come on , children !
you prefer a book to your husband 's company ?
how are you ? having any luck ?
... .in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and , as you put it ... . ... 'recharging his batteries ' ?
what are we going to do , take a taxi ?
well , there used to be ! what 's your name ? i 'm lo . the hans call me dark cloud . i 'm not that tall or big , but i 'm quick as lightning .

i tried cheerios this morning . he did n't even get up . maybe they took out the wrong teeth .
for her ?
i 'll show you ! i 'll show you !
there 's something i 've got ta take care of , louis .
it 's chinese food . it was the only place open . you said you was starving , you 'd eat anyth ...

fred krueger did it .
is it going well ?
who 's that ?
are n't we all .
what 's his name ?
i slept with her once in school . i was just a kid . i was experimenting . it was just that one time . she developed a ... fixation ... on me . she styled her hair like mine . she wore the same kind of clothes i did . it scared me .
she was right to leave me .
you 're the boss . one thing , though .
what are you spying on ?
no , not homeless people . beggars , francis begbie -- one of my mates . i would n't say my best mate , i mean , sometimes the boy goes over the score , like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he 's fucking gubbed me in the face , right --
take him .
norma , this is bela -- bela , this is norma . norma , this is tor -- tor , this is norma . norma , this is paul paul , this is norma .

oh yeah . see , susie , a man does n't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off . oh no . the big house does things to a man .
you shut up ! they 're beautiful , but get them some water .

you want to talk about regrets , you 're talking to the wrong person .
collect ?
almost there , louis .
uh-huh . lived there till i was twenty or so and then moved to chicago when i got married .
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i 'll take brutal indifference .
we can cut back at the end .
you do n't want to .
roger . and i 'll get that other key .
i ca n't tell you the whole story . i. i took it upon myself . i ca n't say more .
is he going to see this ?
she said ...
if you ever want to see star again , then you better come with us .
me too . but i 'm not sure uncle charles will be .
chicago is pretty close to new york nowadays - only twenty hours -
and where is this guest ? do n't they want to interview him .
well , i just do n't know how to thank you , mr. barnes --
dude , watch me work . they go for sensitive studs like me .
honeymoon temporarily canceled . the boy should still go out and exercise . i have the impression he never gets any exercise . he simply bloats himself with fig newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators .
faith , can i talk to you a second ?
oh , lots of reasons , most of them boring . but , up until i dropped out , john and i were ... very much alike .
excellent , athos . you have a keen sense of this man .
what are you doing here ? this is our territory
what the hell are you doing ?
in new york .
no .
oh , right , you told me that . they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese , as i recall . how about you , winston ?
of course not . what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are .
what about < i > my < /i > motive ? now i can say i fucked a us marshal . you think i will ?
we 'd be in all the papers !
i got a place for you . in my family ... or in the cemetery .
c'mon . everyone 's turning colors . kids are making out in the street . no one 's getting their dinner -- hell , you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
tell me ; have you done anything to secure my release ? no ! have you petitioned the court ? never ! sought audience with the emperor --
that makes a change .
bastard ... sheila , do n't go anywhere . i 'll be right back .
ah , yes ... i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck .
well , without a cure for the virus , we 're nothing more than digestives anyway .
sean , this is ridiculous . you 're acting very immature .
he 's my brother ...
ross , honey , it 's time for your massage ...
all right , damn you ! all right ! give me a minute to inform my crew .
give me a bit more credit . i think it 's time we got back together , you know . i 'm more mature , you 're more mature , you 're finishing college , i 'm already in the job market ...
how did it happen ?
horticulture ? wow . i did n't know there was a college here .
as a matter of fact , he 's the one who introduced me to carl ... how are you ?
you chickenshit punk ...
i do n't know ... i know you are right . i do n't know that this is right .
have you heard of jonas salk ?
um , no , y'know what ? forget the water , just give me a loaf of bread ... white bread .
things change . now i 'm taking off my clothes ... all by myself .
thanks for the warning -- ow ! damn !
you wanted to warn me ...
i 'll open mine , too .
over .
fifteen years ?
what is it ?
sure . each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back . no problem .
they -- excuse me ...
oh , why did n't you say . for two-hundred i got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back ... i 'll gift wrap it for you . the deal is fifteen hundred . cash . take it or leave it .
until the accident ? no . yes , there was .
i thought just earplugs .
and who has access to that floor ?
i just want you to know ... i mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me .
ok ... because of the time difference if you needed to call me early ?
stop it , wolfi . i look dreadful . welcome to our house , herr mozart .
please ... be cool .
please . get back into bed .
my security people are right next door .
wow .
expensive gifts , surprise late-night visits , over-the-top flattery ... you always come on this strong ?
all right , join the party . mr. spock , the ship is yours .
this is where it started .
little village down seven . supposed to be charming .
and he 's the real thing . specializes in cases like this , like yours .
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car ?
same to you .
oh no ! no ! shit !
i thought we would meet alone .
the british occupy the building where this guy , hinkel , ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems they 've ... they 've discovered his secret archive .
i came here from a long distance to stay at the grand hotel . i want a room -- a big room -- like you would give general director preysing -- i 'm as good as mr. preysing -- i can pay like mr. preysing -- would you give him a little room , way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang ...
i believe you are blushing , mr. big artiste . i ca n't imagine monsieur monet blushing .
absolutely !
we are .
i 'm not screwing around with you man ... i hate the cold water .
anyway , i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned .
and so the tapeworm no longer has a head . are you satisfied , mathieu ? in algiers everything should be over .
i imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the seventh national bank of tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party .
free weights . will oh yeah ? me too . what do you bench ?
teasing you is completely unfair .
maybe if i stick your fuckin ' face through this window over here like , you know , you 'll - you 'll get unconfused . give me the fuckin ' money !
because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me .
i never said i was n't upset . of course i 'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it was n't some `` symptom '' of something ...
comrades , if we ring nine times ... let 's go in .
well , no . you agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to . the station entered into this on that understanding . if you had refused we 'd have begun this with somebody else . you ca n't just change the rules in the middle of the game , son . it 's not fair to us . more importantly , it 's not fair to the viewers . they 're interested in you . they 've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you .
maybe i can turn it into a bit . i can go back on the show , and say it was rigged . demand a recount ...
i think you must be mistaken , sir .
michael , believe me . you know the kid 's a little crazy sometimes . i vouched for him and he 'll come through . i promise . i 'll talk to him and straighten him out . do n't worry , ok ?
here you are .
i came to kill her .
how much ?
romeo and rosaline . scene one ! god , i 'm good !
they said i was dogged ?
apart from that , you look pretty chipper for a man who 's two thousand and thirty one years old . i read the clocks . they bear out hasslein 's hypothesis . we 've been away from earth for two thousand years , give or take a decade . still ca n't accept it , huh ?
what is it ?
she wanted me to tell you --
this had nothing to do with shoes that did n't fit or my relationship with my father who , as you know , made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties . these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor .
kept us warm for twelve years .
tony bennett ... what do you mean ?
father karras ? father karras ? damien ? the reponse please damien !
you 've been listening in the whole time ?
alex ... ? !
look ... i do n't know what your problem is ...
you really think so ?
how the hell did you get here anyway ?
erica is in the van back there .
come on , you can do better than that . give him teeth - the whole personality .
are you telling me no ?
he any good ?
well , look at it this way , mr. yelburton . mulwray did n't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around , so . you decided to ruin it . then he found out that you were dumping water every night . then he was drowned .
are you happy with your salary and position ?
yo , a bad reputation -- twenty years from now people will say 'd'you remember marie ? ' 'no , who was she ? ' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop . ' 'oh , now i remember ! ' ... see , they do n't remember you , they remember the rep .
hello .
a year ago i was leaving work late one night . two guys tried to mug me . it was horrible . jerry came out of nowhere . to my rescue . then he started coming to see me . could 've been a storybook if he was n't crazy . at first i did my beat to avoid him . but there 's something inside jerry and ... jerry made me see it . < u > he made me < /u > < u > see him < /u > . that make sense ?
of course the line 's just imaginary . you can cross it twenty times ... nothing really changes .
you stayed after all .
she went to medical school in california .
because you left , man . she 's got her own world to deal with in new york . she was a sweet girl but fuck her . you got ta move on . you got ta let go of the past . the future is so beautiful . every day is so sunny out here . it 's like manifest destiny man . i mean , we made it . what 's past is prologue . that which does not kill us makes us stronger . all that shit . you 'll get over it .
what the hell are you talking about ?
not at the moment .
what about rule one : never let the person you are protecting out of your sight !
when ?
it 's a good thing i did n't have that baby , is n't it ?
you 're kidding ?
and i thought you were a bright woman .
i 've got a date with one of them at ten . can you make it ?
a letter from who , you shit sucking cock master ?
not when it 's like this . this animal has been ashore for 10 , 12 hours , and drifting for a day , at least . every little nibbler in the sea 's taken a bite .
it 's about to work , just come on .
hi .
sure . they 're like anybody else . they got work to do . they do it . only they happen to be the best men in the business .
no .
all i want ... is to make it to sidnaw , and sit down for christmas dinner . watch some ball with my old man , sleep in my old bed , and have leftovers for bout six months .
hello marylin .
we 're not gon na hurt you .
john , they 're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you . i know you think you 're doing your job , and i can appreciate that , but you 're just dragging this thing out . none of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the la police , and they 're just not gon na start doing that until you stop messing up the works .
we 're taking a flight ?
if i 'm not taking you away from anything .
take at look at it .
hmm . a difficult proposition ... difficult proposition at best . perhaps you 've noticed ... we 're not exactly packing them in these days ...
when they put me on hold , to talk to you ... they play the tapes . i mean : i 'd seen the commercials and heard about you , but i 'd never heard the tapes ... .
i sure an glad they let scraps ride up here with us .
panes is not on your team anymore .
because ...
twelve .
i have something to tell you .
mama was probably asleep .
he looked old , did n't he ?
craig stole maxine from me , dr. lester .
that 's enough .
oh , yeah . there .
you know as much as i do , miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime , were n't you ?
ah . how did they treat you ?
you want me to give up , huh ? look , sal 's in back with the girls . anything happens to me - one move - and sal gives it to them . boom boom . how do i know you wo n't jump me ?
i know where you can find any number of naked girls who 'd love to hop on board .
i do n't care -- she 's a cop . that 's the important thing . cop-ness , not sex-ness . it wo n't be perfect , but it 'll be good .
i 've done my homework . i 've studied her .
hey .
bloody peasant !
there 's no one `` looking at you '' .. there 's hardly anyone in here . the only person looking at you , is me .
what 's the problem ?
do n't he have a home to go to ?
why do i always have to sit in back ?
should i stay ?
when will they stop ?
no . i saw her with tod .
yes , sir .
why is that ?
they can use their imaginations .
oww ! my arm , careful !
on the contrary . we 're married and we have no pre-nup , so a case could be made that everything in here is mine .
do n't worry , big guy . i 'm sure she got out of here before it happened .
it 's coming along .
just a little experiment .
three times . powerful number .
italy , france , moscow . they all just wan na be nebraska . old man kaplan thinks since communism is dead , we got nothing to do . man , democracy is n't free elections . we got ta teach the world that democracy is big tits , college football on saturdays , eddie murphy saying the word `` fuck '' and kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on `` america 's funniest home videos . ''
who 's whiskey dick ?
as you wish .
tell her later .
i 'm not getting an answer .
i like my horizons narrow .
i drink . after hours of course . on duty , i smoke . do you mind ?
yeah .
hullo , son , how are you ?
jeff wigand , michael moore .
do n't bother hoagie ... .
oh , man .
you were acting like a different person .
naw , not yet . i want ye to give this to mizz wheatley . hit ai n't much , but maybe there 's a little somethin ' to hep out . hits what i 've earned fixin ' lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill cox .
roger ?
morpheus , what 's happened to me ? what is this place ?
then you explain it to me ? !
who ?
will the structure hold if we blast through ?
good ? i was-
you 're part of this , are n't you ? !
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time .
no .
her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner . even let me put my hands on her butt .
not officially . her and steve kendall were pinned at birth . but i was crazy about her . and for about three months , i managed to catch her during her `` exploring '' stage .
nothing of any importance , eh ?
we ca n't < u > afford < /u > a war .
fourteen-fifty hours , sir .
listen , that 's a pentangle , a five- pointed star . it 's used in witchcraft . lon chaney , jr. and universal studios maintain it 's the mark of the wolf man .
what 's wrong , annie ? you 're not smiling .
yeah ... but i think weak legs ai n't bad sometimes , y'know .
well , okay - thank you , detective .
uh-huh . fell right on my head . sprechen sie deutsch ?
another one ?
i 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !
but , mr. stone , i am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience . is this your signature ?
yes , so what . it 's nothing serious , really . just a small defect .
it 's not going to let us out !
it 's not that big a deal . we just did n't hit it off .
maybe you did n't hear me .
that 's just it ! you do n't have to flaunt it . you 're no slave to fashion ... although ...
no . at the end ... when we had him cornered , he got into my head . he showed me what we really look like , when the veneer 's gone . jelly . shit ...
but why now ?
what 're we going to do ? !
it matters to me .
wow , this is so cool ...
no you guys ... something happened ... you guys wan na hear something creepy ? i do n't think kenny is dead .
mrs. lampert , i 'm afraid you 're in a great deal of danger .
the door security systems are shutting down .
okay , i get your father , i get your mother and i get your brother , but what are you doing here ?
gee , we hate to leave you like this , major kong . but there is n't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around .
georgia .
now , mother , a body ca n't help their feelin 's .
we 're not going to the game , are we mom ?
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time . in my own time ... .
not at all , mister mcmurphy ...
i never asked you !
fuckin ' asshole .
elizabeth , this is hardly appropriate --
ray reddy 's house .
do n't mind if i do .
elena , what are you 're talking about ?
it was in a church ... it was so real . i mean , i could feel his breath on me .
no ?
no . no ... do n't go yet . i feel as if i ... i do n't understand you . and i want so much to understand .
lungs sound fine . you did n't have any pre-existing physical conditions , did you ? allergies ? infections ?
so how 's that book of yours going , miles ? i think you were almost done with it last time we talked .
where ? where ?
i was born in new york city . i grew up . and here i am .
... it 's very american .
i 'll go to the craps table , make a big scene . when security comes over , you make your move .
happy ? oh , you mean like , physically . i 'm good . look , i have a snooze button now !
what do you want from me ? i 'm trying to be fair . but i ca n't keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .
gotcha , cab three . who is that ? that you , lindsey ?
i will guard pearl with my life ...
nothing happened , he says . some operator you got yourself there , charley . one more like him and we 'll all be wearing striped pajamas .
put the key in and turn it . the right pedal is gas , the other one 's the brake .
hello .
if i were *triplets* , i could n't -- . look , senator -- let me give you a rough idea . a member has a bill in mind -- like you -- a camp . right ?
maybe you could use socks , nick . jesus , i mean , come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now .
i 'm sure that 's true , miss . and that 's why we 're doin ' what we 're doin ' . what 's happenin ' underground here is just what lucifer planned for this sinful race o ' man . but we 're gon na beat lucifer . we 're gon na put an end to what 's happenin ' here .
harry , i 'm serious , trust me harry this woman 's lifting us in , you got ta treat her like every tom dick and harry .
i do n't know . that 's strange .
run down and get some smelling salts , will you ?
a big one ... .
but , keitel , if erik ever finds the horn resounding ... if he ever crosses bi-frost , the rainbow bridge ... if he ever wakens the gods..
but , i 'm mean .
that 's not the point .
helen , there 's a double agent in my outfit ... i do n't know who . there 's no one i can trust . except you . can you get away ? just for two days .
he 's just playing , q ...
that 's fine . i would n't expect you to see it any other way .
i got two minutes .
bullshit !
what ?
trust me . of course i still have to pitch it to my boss , but we 'll have an answer one way or the other .
nah . i do n't play well with others .
anything you have to say to me , you can say in the morning .
i 've come to see you , sir , about an auction ...
you going to knott 's berry farm with him ?
very insightful .
oh ?
dad , i 'm going to jail and you know it .
we 're ok .
i 'm not wasting my water on him .
some flies ? i think this qualifies as way more than `` some . ''
it 's so clean . no germs .
go back . i 'm going to kill him .
i had no idea it 's gotten that bad , sis .
i promise ... i swear .
you are late . hurry .
fine , i 'm sure it 's in the file at home . i 'll call you when i find it , and then we 'll talk .
let me guess something . this is your first visit to la la land . you 're staying somewhere over in hollywood because , like an idiot , you thought that would be an exciting place to stay . right so far ?
i 'm sorry for what my brother did this morning . they 're assholes .
matter of fact , jay , my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of `` beauty . ''
far right .
yeah , and um , he used to hit me too .
why , i 'm surprised , mr. burns . that 's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she 's no longer your wife .
lydia , believe me ... we know ... all the hard stuff is the same over here . you 're going to be who you are ... whether you 're alive or dead ... and over here -- it 's ... it 's flat ... there 's no food , no colors ... you ca n't smell the flowers . if we knew then what we know now we 'd have been more careful ...
everybody that she plays with dies .
let it go .
let him watch . i want him to know what he 's missing .
thought you knew your way around dark alleys , detective .
no !
i do n't know . mary lazarus , what do you think ? they 're pretty raw .
you got a dime ... . ?
no juice , looks like it 's been laid up for years . but we might be able to adapt --
what do you want it to be ? vivian , my name 's vivian .
party without me .
you talk as though you intend on staying .
no , johnnie . no goddamned phones . not now .
that 's when you 've got to fight them . that 's when you 've got to make them . that 's -
gooood !
i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid . where a boy ...
patterson and i will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by the time we 're done , i promise you , the odor of blood will be irresistible .
whose house is it ?
i am true -- to my lord , the king of heaven . he knows how much i love him -- that 's all that matters to me ...
he 's been full of vinegar lately .
i 'm not talkin ' about your damn word , jerry . geez , what the heck 're you ? ... well , look , i do n't want to cut you out of the loop , but his here 's a good deal . i assume , if you 're not innarested , you wo n't mind if we move on it independently .
lisa , c'mon . one guy sticking his dick in another guy 's mouth ? it 's disgusting .
captain , we ca n't see her , but she gives off heat ...
how could i ? i will do my best . after all , you see , i am financially interested .
now do n't say that -- he 's just off somewhere working .
yes .
what 's wrong ?
what happened ?
well ... yes . all right . but -
i was there , you were the only one who did n't panic . so do everyone a favor , do n't hog all the guilt . you held on as long as you could . yes , everything did go wrong , starting with hal . i mean , what was he doing up on the tower with a girl who could barely climb ?
erin -- lem me tell you something . if i'da put three researchers on this , i would n't expect them to dig up all the information you got here . this is some damn good work .
yes , but they do n't really need them . it 's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney .
how could i ? i 'm helping you clean up mark 's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george ?
uh , tower , we got a problem up here .
what about you , captain ?
look at the publisher . handbook for the recently deceased press .
i 'm doing a piece on right-wing groups , post oklahoma city . i hear you 're an important figure in those circles . you have a lot of interesting ideas ... .
... trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against ...
ted , what are you doing here ?
did n't you , baby ?
good . where are we ?
tempus fugit !
brother , i do n't know . if i did i 'd tell you . but i just do n't know *who's* to blame !
closer and closer ? until they bite into your throat !
sir , yes , sir !
whatta you mean ? me ?
yeah .
how can we afford it ? on your pay ? what if she steals more ?
open it !
would you like to see the wine list ?
are you serious .
hello , william . i understand you 've been asking for me almost every hour . i would 've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about .
illegal surveillance , reckless endangerment ...
without them , it 's going to be near impossible , chief , to prove shaw 's connection to the cia . we got the same problem with the governors . all of them . reagan in california wo n't give us brading , ohio refuses orville townsend , texas on arcacha , and nebraska on sandra moffet .
let 's knock off early . go to the mall . something lame like that .
yeah !
maybe she 's just run off on a spree .
we moved rooms because of him .
they want me to do things for them .
justin . i wo n't let you die .
what ? !
he was your friend .
as one tribune man to another ?
lose the hardware now .
i intercepted phone calls .
well , he got away , did n't he ? riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off .
could n't find my toothbrush .
if only these coins purchased your other talents , too .
i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely . but if she wo n't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . i need to net one birdie only but if she wo n't fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . to a ghost i must fade ! to a ghost i must fade !
i feel the heat from your skin and the stubble on your chin you 're no good
who financed it ?
god , stacy , it 's not that sad . it 's just david soul and ricardo montalban .
alice would be absolutely tear-ass .
uh , question , ma'am .
a casual one .
i did n't mean it . i do n't know what i 'm saying . i 'm not even sure it was me who killed those people . i do n't remember doing it .
she went to the fight with herb shuttle , i guess .
that 's right . maria ouspenskaya . blonde hiya , ouspenskaya .
oh !
i 'll take my chances .
you mean there 's something you have n't asked me ?
to tell you the truth , we 're looking for a scientist who 's gone missing from the tech center . maybe you know him . richard long .
we have to destroy him .
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad .
yeah , skip , it 's me . jeez ... jeez ... god ... jeez ...
definitely . i 'd say you 've hit the nail on the head .
i do n't think so .
that 's the loch ness monster . and ... kay -- that 's ... 444-eyes ?
no , you may wait behind the screen .
you better bring him home , if you really love him . do n't kill love . you 'll regret it for the rest of your life .
you can be in a room with 100 men , and not like any of them , or you can be in a room with just one man , and he 's exactly the one you want .
good morning , sweetheart . beautiful day .
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob , standing and holding his jacket .
yeah ... he figured out what to do all right .
there 's nothing on the news about a crash . did he say what airline ?
just tell me . wait , here ... do you have change of a hundred ?
mother 's ring . i ca n't take this .
your mother would have been so proud of the way you 've handled yourself through all of this ...

i warned you , dignan .
i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . tuna . check it out . tax records , everything --
you can stick with us , or you can go and look for him . either way you 're probably not getting out of here alive .

if i talk to you , i will miss my ship .
where ya goin ?
our kind of women ?
it is , is n't it ? it is your first time .
i told you , i do n't play well with others .
high voltage ?

i 'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective .
i appreciate you coming in so early .
i had a hotel room .

it 's not breakfast yet .
yes , i have .
why are you here ?

i got ta get back to atlanta in thirteen hours .
send it collect .
maybe .
sure . i remember . . . say , did your ears pop coming up in the elevator ? mine did .
it 's an unusual trade .
there 's no mistake ? you 're absolutely sure ?
anywhere ! i think we should just keep moving .
well , they say here that when you went on a case , you stayed on it . now we ca n't take every nazi in this country to trial , although i would like to ; it 's an impossibility . so we 're going for the big boys in industry , education , law , culture .
hello , evan . it 's very nice to meet you . he 's as handsome as his father .
we do n't have time !
john : john : ... my daughter ...
excuse me ?
i 'm sorry .
he 's too cool . too sharp . i think he 's got something to do with it .
thanks for loading me on the stage . i know now why you did it .

we 're gon na have to do a little tightrope act .
hey , look --

no one broke into this room , sir . someone broke out . that lock was torn off from the < u > inside < /u > .
i am . then , i understand you too serve without salary . you know , since your charming little victories at trenton and princeton , the french court is softening . i expect any time now a ship load of supplies ...
i do n't make no bones about where i 'm going to spend eternity . i have always been wild and you know that . if you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?
i got two years .
we 'd expect him to work in cooperation with you . he 'd report to each of you and to our company 's new york office , to pete -- pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth , and --
it 's not me , beth . i swear . it ca n't be .
yeah . this is the best thing i can do for my life right now .
no , thank you .
you telling me what to do , roderick ?
do n't .
honey , i have to clarify this . the thing is , dr. edelstein , my brother has an absolute < u > horror < /u > of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
come on , rorschach . gim me a break --
you share it with over three million people every day . you know that 's the population of new zealand ? what 's manhattan , thirteen miles long ? that 's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles . read about this one guy . gets on the subway and dies . six hours he 's riding around before anybody notices . think about that . here 's this corpse doing laps around manhattan courtesy of the new york transit system , people getting on and off , sitting next to him , and still nobody catches on . three million . that 's too damn many people .
well sir , it 's 9:30 in the morning .
we made it . commander , we made it . '
why ?
not really , no . something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news , why you 've kept everything a secret ... when did it crash ?
you still know .
i better call again .
mom抯 refining her strategy for dday .
i feel like i 'm being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
well that 's what i said .
they do n't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow . and they 're good mother .
i had this whole thing in my head , i was gon na be able to get this to you today -- i have to leave today --
he might well be . but not the way they say . he did n't crawl out of that car by himself . you saw those dents on the door -- someone pulled him out .
i remember when they all referred to me as `` the little spic poor annette married . '' except her brother . you treated me with respect . look , you paid your dues . your slate is clean now .
okay , so ...
i checked out your stuff at the library . awesome work , really . why would someone like you want to go out with a ... with a..what exactly am i , again ?
to his own daughter ?
you want to put in chain saws ?
no ! do n't ! lasher ! ! !
oh , sure , that sounds great .
did you change your hair ?
my vision got worse again .
come on . hand over .
listen , harry , how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand ? you pay me back at your convenience , no interest .
off limits .
he 's lying . hauser turned against you .
do n't be callous .
you 're right . the killer told me .
forget about it , i do n't want you working in one of those honky tonks .
well , here 's the deal , max . this thing i 'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography . stuff that 's sold under the counter , illegally ...
no , they 'll do even more . we 've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... do you understand what i mean ? starting tomorrow , they wo n't be groping in the dark any more ; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy , a self-confessed criminal ... and they will be able to pass to the offensive . have you thought of this ?
i do n't know how i could 've missed you with that shirt on . it 's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color . right ?
out here . on your knees .
oh , yes , i heard you all right . $ 20,000,000 . that 's quite a lot , is n't it ?
what about the others ?
on the contrary ! the puling , pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting . now you are splendid ... a fierce goddess ... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful .
yup . hey , so i heard you dropped in on tran last night . another slick lenny move .
if i see him .
well , we better hit the road , too . craig , get your stuff .
one of barnes ' duds , luckily for us . take this out of the equation right now ...
yeah , i understand , tommy .
i do n't know . i 'm lost . i 'm scared . i feel like i 'm disappearing . i 'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me .
okay . you can be elvis .
well , that 's great then ! terrific ... except ... it just occurred to me . i do n't know where i live ! i 'm lost ! i do n't know where home is ! would you excuse me ?
no ! it ca n't be !
they 'll use their best men . but they better be paying attention ...
i do n't follow ...
i 'm serious . aside from the cheating , we were a great couple . that 's what high school 's all about-algebra , bad lunch , and infidelity .
frank !
where ?
it 's a long walk back to aspen .
you might say that , although i do n't think of it as traveling .
i 'm worried , lovington . after all , something might have happened to her .
to an artistic eye , you understand . have you ever modeled ?
could be .
he was shot .
what ?
it 's all right . trust me . do n't move .
jesus , that 's beautiful .
but i thought you -- i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then .
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it . ca n't you see ? you 'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it .
it is so considerate of you .
you 're calling jake stupid ? you ! ?
how can he not have a heartbeat ?
the performance -- the performance -- the performance .
he was all right to me .

would you be caring for something to eat or drink , sir ?
i hate to bust your bubble , but i was n't defending you .

i 'd like to get in my two cents ' worth .
you .
i 'm sure you are .
my god .
not really . look , annie , i love you . let 's leave that out of it . i do n't want to be someone you 're settling for . i do n't want to be someone anyone settles for . i have a life insurance policy , i 'm fully invested in growth stocks , i have a paid subscription to home rox office , i have no sexual diseases , i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that is n't soft , i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth , i dress nicely , i am a member of the private sector , an independent voter , i do n't watch monday night football , the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat , strawberries , penicillin , pollen , nuts and wool . there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring . if you do n't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it , is n't it ?
melvin , even though it may seem that way now -- you do n't know me all that well ... i 'm not the answer for you .
it 's so nice to feel wanted .
pride is his weakness .
dennis hit him . his head 's all big and he wo n't wake up . i 'm really scared .
most enjoyable . herbert greenleaf .
i got to , mama . i know daddy wants to see him .
scar ?
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can抰 you go back there ?
i get by .
palmed it right in the goddam chamber .
oh she knows you 're very busy , especially now , with everything going on ... the doctor said to try her on solids , but she 's been right off her food ... you take this up to her . tell her you made it . she 'll like that .
thank you .
okay . all right . okay .
maybe it was just a dream . ya know , just one of them , what do ya call 'em , fitful dreams ?
aahhhhnnnaaahahnn . aaaaaahhhhooowwwoooooooooooooooooooooo !
my . it 's gotten longer .
where does nicky get his hair cut ?
i had to get up anyway .
yeah , yeah , it 's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph .
high ? do you ever get high ? a walk on the wild side . ever do dust ?
you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible .
never thought i 'd hear ray gibson say that . hell with you then . you 'd only slow me down anyway .
i do n't think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair .
does n't count . you got ta say the words .
you are targeted for termination . the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission . ever .
there wo n't be a next thing .
not from us !
pop , this is important to me . it 's a simple question . if he would just answer the question , that 's the end of it .
can i have my gun back ?
there will be more of them . they always travel in groups . and there 's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships . just what we need right now .
you 're still my best girl , cora .
considering you brought my mother into it , $ 71.50 .
hey , stu , why so glum ? everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare .
i want to lie low till i get the whole dope . i do n't want to go off half-cocked .

in case they try to kill us . i do n't know , what do you want me to say ?
just some guys i met here ... i keep seein ' 'em ... now tell me ...
almost as good as you .
maybe you 're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof ?
it 's dudley for the nite owl .
hello , gabriel .
oh , henry , no , that 's just boring .
always - like tits on a pig . i wish i had a million of those bimbettes .
good . you have kids ?
he meant what you were saying on the tour : that if things keep on the way they 're going , humpbacks will disappear forever .
it 's true !
i saw the smile -- good piece .
i 'm sorry that i did n't build you a stronger ship , young rose .
you mean that guy was an agent ?
we 'll go with you .
oh , i bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it . go- go-go !
and you do have a reputation , so i 'll choose my words carefully . but not to put too fine a point on it , fuck yourself , harry !
you could give me the gun .
political science . it 's all about what 's going on .
it 's for shelly 's famous potato salad .
okay . great , martin , that 's just great . meaning to life ... mmm ... .
i 'm serious , honey . do n't get out of my sight , all right ? i want you to stay right by me . will you do that for me ?
this is all witwer . he 's setting me up .
a blank canvas ! i could paint your portrait , directly on you . or maybe not . so , you ? husbands ? boyfriends ? girlfriends ? where do you live ?
of course i know -- who do you think is paying for it ? the emperor himself , did n't you know ? why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front ? burning patriotism ? filial love ? he wants to be sure when he takes over there 's enough cash left in the treasury to ... play emperor . watch out for him , narcissus ; he 's inexperienced , but ... be careful .
argon 's private lab .
that 's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage ?
no , i absolutely understand . of course .
i do ... i cut `` em ...
you got that big retarded girl down there ?
oh god . oh god . oh goddy god .
alright , well , alright : geopolitically ...
okay .
oh yeah , yeah i 've driven by that place before . i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place .
the ambassador will receive instructions for the drop , half an hour before it is to be made . if it is successful , there will be more . thank you , agent carter .
this is a sweet side of you . picking these up for ... `` mrs. haniver '' and ... `` mrs . raines . '' where are they ?
this david 's a friend ?
a field trip ? maybe i 'll join you . see you tomorrow .
does n't seem like enough to turn back on , does it ?
this is indiana -- nothing 's going to happen to you .
why would they do that . they hired me .
the causes of suffering arise from true sources . attachment , desire , envy , hatred , greed , unkindness , wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering .
he can wait . let 's stay here until morning .
i 'll call you .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
he knows a lot about sean connery .
you got what you wanted . you going to release us now ?
yeah , ever since that ...
i am in awe of it , mother .
be a swimmer .
switching to sub-vocal . gib , you copy ?
i need your help .
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca-cola again .
i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process . not only physical , but also psychological .
abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring .
any place .
shut up . west 's dead .
you are being rude again .
why is it always this ? i owe it to myself ? what if i do n't want to ?
and we wo n't stretch up our arms ...
i will stop this car right now .

then my luck would have changed .

what ?
they not together , sir . we do n't see him in a long time now .
i 'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you .
neither could i. i think it 's bukowski .
uh , yeah , you mind getting me a piece of that cake they 're eating down there ? i 'm starving .
yeah and when we 're mad at each other we 're out of sync . it only works if you 're on good terms .
the blonde dish .
carolyn -- you want these candlesticks ?
what ?
what ?
i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years . every time her husband came to visit , her heart would beat faster . is n't that something ? i do n't know what name scientists have for something like that ...
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record . you ran guns to ethiopia . you fought against the fascists in spain .
men like you do n't need orders .
we 're going to think about it .
somehow i feel safer in here .
no .
i ca n't close these leads , john . no one can . it 's a joke . john , look , just give me a hot lead . just give me two of the premium leads . as a `` test , '' alright ? as a `` test '' and i promise you ...
... why do you think ?
you 'll be seeing stars in a minute , miss teschmacher . y'know ?
nazeer chaudry !
i 'm alright . let 's go .
so you 're just going to give up and go home ?
he said , 'could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , 'you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? '
i wo n't be at the office except to sign in . i 've got a lot of claims to check out . all over the place . garages and more garages . i 'll come home right after work .
i ca n't find him . i 've tried everything . i thought you might know .
i dunno . one ?
bullshit .
of course , harold 's father had a similar sense of the absurd . i remember once in paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next i hear he 's arrested for floating nude down the seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings . well , that cost quite a little bit of `` enfluence '' and `` d'argent '' to hush up , i can tell you . harold , dear , stop playing with your food . do n't you feel well ?
what do you mean clean ?
all right . i 'll do it . i 'll do it .
they sort of got away .
went over to philly yesterday an ' seen the folks ... it 's nice you send them the fifty a month ...
suppose i slip them a few bucks ? for the funeral expenses .
yes -- why ?
the food will make you feel bedder . look at me -- i 'm da happiest guy i know !
but that 's tomorrow .
yes , with all due respect , i do citizen barras .
i 'm sorry , sir . general schmuck is asleep and he is n't taking calls until eight-thirty .
i do n't mind a parasite . i object to a cut-rate one .
if you need us we 'll , be five hundred feet underground waiting for the nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring .
absolutely .
i understand something .
so , i met a new friend .
it 's cheaper than a movie , and there 's free coffee .
... at least that takes bobby seale off the street ...
is that the one who died ?
if you did n't talk so much , maybe you could think more .
no one comes here after dark .
i was so worried for fear he 'd knock over a vase or something . i must have acted like an idiot . what does it say about the reception last night ?
do you honestly think you 'll find a boy in that ... that officer 's school who 's serious about marriage ?
or -- since one is a well-known and respected guest -- one could go to the desk in the lobby and say `` miss mayfield seems to have lost her room key -- have you another '' ? they always have another .
yeah , you gon na be there ?
home .
... cigarette girls ... and naturally -
oh no i did n't !
put them all together and what do we have ?
at least he does n't have a beard ... .
an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you , tappy head , you ai n't worth the salt you put in greens .
you 're out of your mind .
all right , brad , all right - you do n't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - i 'd want to . hello , georgie .
why ? she 's a junkie .
limos , huh ?
have you made up your mind ?
cole . do n't you know it 's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding ?
thank you .
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request . means 'no . '
i 'm john mcclane .
come again .
what do you mean ... yale thing ?
how many kids do you have ?
no .
if ever i saw a sign from heaven !
it may be important to you , m'sieu giron --
just send me a money order .
phillip , this is worse than that trip to quebec city when i fell asleep in that disco .
a typical fuck-up .
michael , please ! i 'm sure you will find her most willing , herr mozart . she 's really very excited . she 's been preparing all morning .
spare me your notions of poetry , please . we all have our assigned duties and ...
i will be there in five minutes . go back to your guests .
i 'll be ... somewhere else .
another sex dream ?
i can not be certain .
thank you , carl .
she got away .

but it 's your birthday .
oh man , bucky .
that 's good .
sex .
hey ... what the hell you doing ?
what were you fighting for ?
yep .
no ... thank you ! ... i 'll be bringin ' the `` caddy '' by tomorrow .
your mother all right ?
forgive me , my friends . i saw terrible things .
yeah .
open it .
yeah .
someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us .
krempe has a way of provoking my temper .
nothing .
i do n't know . he 's a hairdresser .
what if you 're not here tomorrow ?
we what ?
yeah . sort of . daddy rounds 'em up . you are n't talking about money , their beady little eyes go dead .
um -- hello ? you want to like take a look ?
lem me alone ...
look , i 'm just tellin ' you how tommy feels . jake is makin ' it hard on himself . tommy wants him with us . it 's as simple as that .
you 're firing me ? ? you do n't even pay me !
two . and i 'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with al junior .
i do n't know .
she 's not going to like it ... .
so you 're saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ?
okay , yeah . i did something naughty ... there 's this amazing comix store in seattle . to tell you the truth , i did it once or twice at stanford . 'guess i ca n't keep anything from you ...
yeah -- the grass was kind of wet .
how is she ?
she spoke ? susan spoke ?
oh no ! we ca n't fight this thing ! there 's only six hours of air left -- we 're dead men !
what 's the matter , george ? something wrong ? you look like you just fucked your mother .
yeah .
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way : an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces !
i 'm fine . what 's up ?
cal , too ?
that !
yes .
are you a writer too ?
teh ... tehronne ?
i ca n't do that .
i had a little problem in one store . i was n't dressed right . i do n't know what to say . i do n't belong there . maybe i 'll just go back to bridget . she was cool .
that was for christmas .
fine . how 's your eye ?
adam ... .you should go with dr. aron . it 's the best thing . the best thing for you . i promise .
how ya feeling ?
actually this is all just a bad dream . you 're home in bed . heavily sedated , resting comfortably , and dying from the carcinogens you 've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering . tragic irony or poetic justice ? you tell me .
she 's as good as gone ...
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that 's my problem . if you do n't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you ca n't imagine .
you watched the tape ? friedman and his people don抰 just provide little kids and videotapes , mrs de moraes . they抮e in the import-export business . they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise .
but to go to war over trade , over money ? surely there 's still time for a compromise .
aw , i 'm sorry , mr. dickson . it 's just kind of sudden , that 's all . sure , i 'm excited . i think it 's great . only , well , you 've done so much for me already . . . i 'll never be able to thank you enough .
what was that ?
really ? please ?
well , sir , consider the possibilities . a : ryan is alive . we have to take him back to the beach . knowing you , you do n't let him carry my gear , even though he really should , and we all get killed , trying to keep him alive .
tonight .
yes . did you eat ?
louella ... did n't she call me a spoiled little bitch ?
what about room 237 ?
is it dead ?
will he live ?
strong am i with the force ... but not that strong ! twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . that is the way of things ... the way of the force .
how many bullets left , kid ?
i - i ... i ca n't , michael . there 's stuff -- - at the clinic -
oh ... i do . yeah . it 's just that i told my `` dad '' i 'd clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
what are you thinking ?
no , i 'm sorry . i should 've made an appointment . was that anything important ?
try seven . from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident . you wan na tell me what 's going on ? huh ?
willing ? i like that . and , this one ?
really , though . my thoughts go haywire sometimes .
i 'm okay , honey , i 'm okay . are you alright ?
to the cops ?
wait ! wait ! let me ask you something . if you like shot superman with those guns , would he feel it or what ?
kin you spare a moment for me jabez ?
daddy , buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books . mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it , he took the lords name in vain , then claimed he had n't said it . he lied , daddy .
crabtree ? he does n't even know james .
how 's it going .
way to go , evy .
excellent . see . who says a guy in a rubber suit ca n't be smart ? well , it 's been grand . sorry you all have to die now .
now , instead of the cops only lookin ' at nicky , they started looking at green too . and he was supposed to be our squeaky ...
well you 're a writer , and a lot of writers are gay . look at truman capote .
cut round him for now .
who are you , jerry ?
youthful high spirits .
vito , get a broom and sweep out front .
but you 'll think about what i said about working together , huh ?
i do n't know where . in your store , somewhere in your town ... anywhere .
am i ?
look , i help take care of the place . you got my check , did n't you mom ?
hey , do n't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin ' it on ?
there has to be .
you serious about having him over ?
what do you have in the box ?
so , we get the mother , we get the boy .
yes .
you know nothing of power , you foolish girl . you think power is a mighty sword , or a strong castle , or the paltry magic of an emerald seer . power is none of these .
you were talking to him ! what 'd you tell him ! ?
i did . he said he had work to do until late .
shut up . i 'm only trying to explain .
how well my comfort is revived by this .
they jerked my wheels , d'you believe it ? i mean it 's outrageous , the computer errors the banks are making lately . have you noticed ?
life . you 've stopped living it . you look , but you do not see . you listen but , you do not hear .
a flack jacket .
i 'll ride with him . you follow .
oh . `` kyle . ''
little bill , i thought you were dead . i see you shaved off your chin whiskers .
what you dream ?
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them ? !
yes . i remember ...
you know what i think ? i think vada 's very lucky to have a friend like you .
it 's over , finished and done with .
the truck ?
power you have given me . what can my power give you ?
oh , maya . no .
to exchange our thoughts - what does a russian know about business ? on the other hand , what does an american know about diplomacy ?
yeah , i think so .
how would you know ? you 're looking at my tits . jesus , carl . your job is to keep us on the road !
i 'm glad you 're doing well .
she 's off limits for bums like you . leave her alone .
i 'm not .
second district ...
i 'll probably kill them . is that likely ?
for supplies , you drive .
... where 's my l'il < u > pill < /u > ?
i do n't know ... you sure tom said it 's all right ?
i ... i do n't know .
and nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to ; a bit anti-social , you know .
yeah .
fine , we 're fine in the circumstances . but i can guess what you 've called about . there 's nothing we can do ; they wo n't reopen the station --
it 's you .
the rest of the money is here in the car . why do n't you come and get it ?
but if you go back they 'll lock you up again .
the kind that gets divorced , but still stay friends .
hi .
absolutely . just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator .
what happens if i want to sneeze ?
mister d'amour ?
i would too . * they lock eyes for a moment , but it 's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other .
you get half mine and i get half yours .
i wish you 'd ...
i 'm sorry to barge in on you like this . but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he was n't in and ... well , you 're here , so ... i know how busy you guys can get .
do n't tell me , down deep he 's really not a bad person and you do n't want to see him get hurt .
and here we are .
well try , okay ?
you wan na keep up the conversation , you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude .
excuse me ?
well , i , i did n't say i was special , but it 's one thing , you know , and it 's another thing to actually communicate it to people . you know what i mean ? if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it , does that make a sound ?
then you 'll be my best man .
ernie told this story . how he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices , he cried . he was till that way when they promoted him out of obits . he says you 're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry . i should have quit this place three years ago .
thank you .
yes ... yes . that would be a great asset .
oh , the hell with you . i met bela lugosi !
well , you look about like the kind of an angel i 'd get . sort of a fallen angel , are n't you ? what happened to your wings ?
uh ... good .
um-hm .
how ya doin ' , jimmy .
well . another time , then . i 'll be all right . he 's not going to attack me ; what i ' m rally afraid of is all in my own head , ruben .
sugar ?
hey , do i know you ?
he would n't ask you to handle it if he were guilty .
wait as long as you like .
i 'm sorry .
yes . but not as a date date .
and what am i ?
no ... nooooooo ... shoot me ! shoot me ! shooooooooot meeeeeeeee ! ! !
hard to believe , is n't it ... ?

hello ?
kit , listen , the guy last night , the one in the ferrari , i 'm at this hotel , the regent beverly wilshire , it 's this absolutely unbelievable place and he 's hired me for a whole week and kit , listen , he 's paying me three thousand bucks ! we can get out of the apartment . we can get out of this town . we can do anything ! kit ? hey , you there ?
then i 'm doing fine .
... and the 'foolish ' emotions which drive us ?
i worked for mr. marsh for six years . he was a good man -- until she came along .
< u > what < /u > !
you seem to be familiar with the stab movies . here 's how we play . i ask you a question . you get it right , your girlfriend lives . you answer wrong , she dies .
of course .
you 're jp monroe , right ?
bob will be very happy .
i was wondering where they 're going to get another tuba player for the band .
do n't let them hear you .
why the fuck would you do that ?
you do n't either . we wo n't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he 's alive or what .
may i presume to ask you a question ?
yeah , i spy or i die .
you 're more than that , luther . they were mistaken about you and they 're trying to show you they know it . they want you back in .
she did n't do it again did she ?
listen , sex ape . i 'm here to stay . and if you do n't want me for a roommate or classmate , you got two options -- move out or ring out . end of file .
i wo n't get lonely .
it 's like a six or seven hour drive . that 's easy , i do n't mind driving .
fuck . me .
that is the racket harry lime organized .
this is my cousin sherman . sherm , say hello to the ghostbusters . i promised him a ride in the car if he got you out .
you ca n't . our next stop is the 23rd century .
betsy , can i talk to you a minute ?
within a month . believe me , i 'm going to quit !
clementine .
oh , do not go
i 'll save you the trouble . i 'm a cab . there . did it myself .
that 's what you think . okay ... truth ... i 'm from what , on your calendar , would be the late 23rd century . i 've been sent back in time to bring two humpback whales with me in an attempt to ... repopulate the species .
mom - i got it all worked out ; it 's over . the best thing is you go home . watch it on tv .
i just do n't think she liked me in that way .
okay , okay ! take it easy !
i -- i got some freaky rare kind . it 's called large-celled carcinoma .
if it will make you feel any better , i do n't have a gun .
too much work . i 'm not really the physical type -- thank you , alfred .
... but she 's , no , betty 's smarter than that . she would n't be here for a ...
well then keep it coming . alright , people , good work ! keep it up and we 'll do great at the state competition .
okay , right , right , okay . another subject . where you living ? still at the hotel ?
oh no .
not that it matters . this is the morgue ?
this is n't just a story ! ! it 's history made allegory . it is a philosophical handbook for life ! it holds the secret of this very voyage .
oh do you ? have you any idea , midshipman preston , how many times i 've had to listen to mr. scott on the comm , telling me his troubles ? have you any idea the ribbing i 've had to endure in the officers ' mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap ?
ann taylor would have paid a lot more , but i would n't trade this experience for the world . sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger -- you think i 'm a big dork do n't you ?
i wish i could tell you . i 'd be real interested to know myself .
i see .
what do we want ?
how about me getting the help . she 's quiet now , is n't she ?
what do you know about it ? i sleep where i want .
no .
anyways , guys , guys , listen , listen to me . i 'm in this computer right ? so i 'm looking around ...
not at all ?
yes , an astonishing power over weak minds .
glad to hear it . tell poor mr larson to come through , will you ?
you know who you 're fuckin ' with ? ! huh ? do you ? !
hmm .
what makes you say that ?
bye .
yes . now go .
jen - you do n't wan na talk about it ?
and how did you get in the school ?

why `` of course '' ?
you ca n't ! they 'll be defenseless against their dreams .
well , there 's someone i think might be --
it was removed from charlie overman 's body .
you guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today .
i can read . i can read !
but they 're somebody 's children .

your mind is so slippery .

i 'll take the parasites .

no offense , but i 've seen you fight . you got ta be kidding m-
because ... i have to be alone !
it would take a minute or so . you wo n't last that long out there .

i think cancer 's make the best lovers . my whole family are air signs .
consumer recreation services . it 's their building . they ...
and what ?
truck drivers bring up harlem specials that blow up in your hand . but this guy do n't deal no shit . just quality . if you ever need anything , i can put you in touch .
everybody has a heart - except some people . of course i 've got bicarb . there 's a box in the pantry . we 'll put your name on it . max fabian . it 'll say there . always . just for you .
no ... there 's a couple of things i 'm still working on .
what kind of restaurant does n't serve wine ?
get mom .
you do n't need the diary , dad . marcus has the map .
german .
a fort ! unconsciously , you chose a name that was belligerent . where were you nurtured ?
last night . you were talking to someone in the corridor .
the hilton .
you think he 's dirty ?
you get that off the screen ?
why ?
what a strange young man .
he got that one right .

i do n't know , ma . i 'm all knocked out . i think i 'll just hang arounna house and watch ...
yup .
'i hope your dreams come true . '
i like the diminished risk . it frees up capital reserves . i like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent . you can predict their behavior ... .
the next one blows off your dick .

now all we 've got to worry about is what attacked him .

the albanian campaign .
they 've got something .
i do n't know . i 'm all right .
alice , you think you can leave ?
i 've been on a plane for twelve hours , i think i 'll stand .

the ring up to him ) what 's a mourning ring ?
okay .
-- i 've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off . he just keeps coming back to the dam -- and what he knows --
they would n't deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance . as for your people , look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen . you sell even more copies than mr dickens .
then what do you care ?
oh . no thanks .
well , you know < u > my < /u > name , honey , but < i > i < /i > do n't know < u > yours < /u > ...

time 's getting short .
it should n't be too much longer . once the roads are open , the lines 'll be up in no time . if you give me their numbers , i 'll keep trying them for you . could i ask you a favor ? i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and ... and i wondered if maybe ...
well i guess i probably heard you call him that .
look , i can be selfish , i know that . i 'm not blind to my own failings ...
it 's an interesting one , pete . if anything was going on it 's totally subdued now .
i 've got the conference next week . i want you to feel safe .

exactly that . we can put you inside someone else 's body for fifteen minutes .
why ?
yeah ?
a little upset is all she was ? because i 'll tell you , jud , my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown .
not at first . you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently . any second i thought you would take off and fly .
you know .
are you and mom home tonight ?
shut down ?
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation , a careful evolutionary process , not chalkboard parlor-tricks .

okay , mr. laird . explain this to me like i 'm a four year old : did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not ?
so maybe this is my dynamite .
you have the right to ask me certain personal questions ?
why ?
we ca n't . all we can do is guard against our own corruption .
what 's this now ?
i just never thought of you in that ...
hey ! somebody 's coming !
it 's just , all our lives you 've been a pastor . for twenty years you 've preached trust in the lord . and then one day you wake up and say fuck him ?

i ca n't wait until next sunday , when the choir performs again . did you see the people walk right in from the street ? that music , that heavenly music -- it called to them .
do it . do it .
it 'll never happen ! you 're in big trouble , mister .
who told you to step on my sneakers ? who told you to walk on my side of the block ? who told you to be in my neighborhood ?
based , i am told , on your recommendation , admiral . thank you .
but we can live without taking human life . it 's possible .
what other issue is there , sid ?

you 're convinced the crew could still be alive ? after seven years ?
wait a second ? who was working here today ?
what did you do tonight ?
i hear the dog really liked him .
what makes you an excellent lawyer ?
you 're apologizing for me ? quite the gentleman..
you do , you do n't . she 's willing to give her life , you 're willing to give yours , it 's touching and magnificent , anything you want but -- this is n't the place for it . do n't you see ? no , you do n't .
that 's not you having a whiskey sour with carmine morada .
thought it might . it 's off an arrest report you typed two years ago . man you wanted samples of everybody .
so ?
you killed her . i saw it .
well , if they hit us first , they 've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already . we 'll just be hitting empty real estate .
then listen to this : i have to get those leads tonight . that 's something i have to do . if i 'm not at the movies ... if i 'm not eating over at the inn ... if you do n't do this , then i have to come in here ...
mordechai !
i 'll try .
i guess you wo n't mind my keepin ' the bottle .
oh , some of 'em . but it 's mostly just strokes and shit . i mean , most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow . usually they die id they 're , you know , really yellow .
actually , i was always partial to roy rogers . i really dug those sequined shirts .
what the hell 's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time ? claire 's in a weird mood too .
certainly . now there 's the principal actor in our little play .
i 'll let you know the next full moon .
why was i assigned to you ? to debunk your work . to reign you in . to shut you down .
but it 's easy . it 's just a breath with sound . say it . what kind of trouble ?
i do n't want you to die !
i don抰 think so . this is going to be a better life for all of us , honey . we抣l put annie and josh in private schools ...
who 's fighting ? this is the test , man . it 's a crazy game .
a thermos of hot coffee . a blanket . socks .
what is it with crack and transsexuals ?
van ripper . can you show where the body lay ?
i 'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her . anything but a talk with her .
and then what happened ?
he took the day off .
no . not bad . women are trouble , you know that , fergus ?
no ? why not ? you know something ? sometimes i figure i 'll never live to see my next birthday . is n't that dumb ?
very well , the job 's still yours , i 'll go . but if i have to return , you 're finished . and i will then do everything i can to destroy your reputation . am i not fair ? told you you 'd hate me .
quiet today ?
before that i was thinkin ' it 'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry .
go on .
jesus !

paul it 's telly . open up .

if you did that , you 'd get nothing except the police after you . if you wait -- i 'll give you your six thousand back --
he -- he made me do it --
what the hell are you talking about ?
good . now take the forceps , and remember , vincent , what we 're doing here is routine . i 've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field . there are no vital organs where you 're working , no major muscles or arteries -- you ca n't kill me . just make sure you 've got the bullet before you try to pull it out .
asia ? how ... how could he get here ?
you mean you 're not coming back to work here ?
well i ... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor .
does 'flintstone ' mean anything to you ?
this might do ... i do n't know ... it just seems kind of `` pricey '' for a fixer-upper , do n't you think ? we 're trying to keep our costs down . you know how it is when you 're starting a new company .
we saw at least thirty ... and there are twenty-two enterprise crewmembers reported missing ... including commander data .
why - er - mrs. teasdale - this is an outrage ! this man is impossible ... my course is clear ... this means war ... you runt !
that 's a beautiful name . french ?
then start taking them seriously .
huh ?
yo , everyone check this out . hey , what 's the da vinci virus ?
twice .
what did they ever do < u > for < /u > us ... ? you see , this is why we have to mobilize the b-2 bomber .
no , but i 've confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much c-4 is missing ?
they 're right behind the door .
it was a nice try , treves , but the man is so obviously mouthing your words .
... i 've missed you . *
i figured he 'd think , you know -- it was the next best thing . hey , i loved it too . a chance to be a part of something important . something bigger than yourself .
too bad . we 'd be out of here in a few hours .
i do , i do . i 'm sure i 'm just ... how was your day ?

homicide , miss hearn . it 's detective eddie flemming . open up .
and you do n't ask questions ?
yup . sixty years old by our count . but he does n't age like we do -- think dog years : he 's barely out of his teens .

why do n't you ? we can finish the script by thursday .
but the good citizens of turley have taken me in their embrace , and for one simple reason . i maintain the peace . so when strangers come to town , i always ask them their business . have you come for the hanging ?
her face was half-pushed into the pillow , and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said , 'i wo n't suck you . do n't ask me to suck you . '
how 's the patient .
i need your advice 棗 something has happened 棗 mr. jacks 棗
someone 's been doing all these things .
because my mom gets the bill .
i just said i did n't fuck around . but you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me .
that 's not a question .
that might not be so bad ... at least for you .
yeah , it 's the place god would have built , if he 'd had the money .
beautiful .
unbelievably sexy . yes , you are . because ... you know what you are ? you're-you 're polymorphously perverse .

how do you know ?
a miracle is an event without an explanation . if she 's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail , why could n't she split a cell in her womb ?
well , a very real expectation is the british will hang you ! they 'll burn mount vernon and they 'll hang you ! our marriage is a business just as surely as ...
why , of course . yes .
the little o'brien girl , of course - the one you suggested in the story .
he 's being thorough , that 's all . i 'm learning about my son , tom , now he 's missing . i 'm learning a great deal about him . i hope you can fill in some more blanks for me . marge has been good enough to do that , about mongibello .

diane , how are you feeling ?
entering my scan now ...
did you find your father ?
you should come have dinner with me . courtney but-when ?
yes sir .
sadly , no . and i find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend . what do you think ?
we 're about to lose communications with starfleet , captain .
hi mom !
not that i can see .
you show me regan 's double : same face , same voice , same everything . i 'd know it was n't regan . i 'd know in my gut and i 'm telling you that that thing upstairs is n't my daughter ! and i want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there 's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind ! you tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism would n't do any good ! you tell me that !
but it 's in the desert where lots of the town 's problems are solved .
diz --

we are almost out of water .
nothing .
hello .
to fucking mutt .
anything in maryland is close .
i 'm afraid i do n't really understand that genre . maybe that 's the prob-
well , let 's go talk to your doctor .
what ?
lie ... ?
mr. roebush ?
i never said that .
no , but it might as well be the same thing . this was a message ... from someone , or something ... hinting ... at the design .
i do n't know , sir . your dear parents . suddenly gone . so much loss ...
what 's your name ?
say hi for me .
what 's that ?
could i just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention .
goodnight then .
look around you . see the country you served . look at people who had real courage , who took risks , who risked their lives . like emmi 's father .
are you nuts , walking into a gun ?
i enjoyed every minute of it .
yup . not far from here , actually .
-- thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of --

sorry .
do you ever see him ?
where the hell do you think it is , potato head ?
no , he was a toad . even more of a toad than merle ... i just wear the ring to keep the flies away . rome was the best thing i ever did , because i did it ! and i swear to you , it changed me . i 've been to rome , italy ! i sat every morning at the cafe sistina and had my cappuccino , and watched the pilgrims walk to mass , and no one can ever take that away from me .
i thought your mom 's coming up ?
indeed , yes , those halcyon days .
a lot of good that 'll do .
what ?
it has n't been that simple so far .
the name of the show ?
keep 'em busy .
what 's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing .
to me , it shows part of our history in this country , a time when we were considered inferior , sub-human .
i do n't care . i love you , chris . you deserve better than chet and i 'm it . please accept these .
joe -- drop everything and come with me !
her car is gone .
what , you think death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago ? you 're nuts .
sully ... ! what the fuck happened here ? !
goodnight , malcolm .
that 's not what i meant .
i 've been watching you work . you 're the best in the place . but you know that .
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt ?
you 're crying , animal .
my name is smith - well , that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month . i 'm white , male and over twenty-one . i 've never been in jail - that is , not often . and i prefer scotch to bourbon . i hate carrots , i hate peas , i like black coffee and i hate garters . i make seventy-five bucks a week and i 've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - i do n't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet .
wh -- , it-it-it-it , it 's so sad . she 's crazy about me , but somewhere on the , along the line , i 've fallen out of love with her .

have you lost all control of this city ?
fifteen for me .
how much do you know about show business , valiant ?
somebody 's taken it . i ca n't find it !
well ... for one thing ... i think it 's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ''
god i guess i 'll have to introduce you now .
the whole city 's together on this one . we took a vote . everybody 's down on you , you know .
it 's just you need to give me the money ... do you have it right now ?
i 'd like that . i need to be away from here .
let 's take our best shot .
defense network computer . new . powerful . hooked into everything . trusted to run it all . they say it got smart ... a new order of intelli- gence . then it saw all people as a threat , not just the ones on the other side . decided out fate in a microsecond ... extermination .
nothing to resolve , ian . let 's get a drink .

good-bye , adam .
what are you doing home ?
oh my , no !
it is a fucking emergency .
i 'm making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does n't bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
they would n't be out in the daytime .
see that was n't so bad .
it 's yours . you won it . it 's a prize .

i ca n't ! i 'm tied !
i did n't forget . i was just working on a tangent . see , most men , they 'll tell a story straight through , and it wo n't be complicated , but it wo n't be interesting either .
okay , okay .

i 'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to hollis and who is involved .
david ... i know we 've had our differences ... but i 've always thought of you as a fair man , even when we 've disagreed -- and it 's in that light i 'm hoping you 'll consider my request ...

you see , somebody went to a lot of trouble here , and i want to find out , lawsuit or no lawsuit . i 'm not the one who 's supposed to be caught with my pants down ... so i 'd like to see your husband . unless that 's a problem .
then why are you doing it ? how much better can you eat ? what can you buy that you ca n't already afford ?
miss ratched , would you please save a space for my aunt ? she 's comin ' down from portland .

we shall attack at once .
i 'm sorry , mr. dean . but larry 's in st. lukes now , so i 'm a little -- i 'm not myself . the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth 's offer , it 'll only get worse .

that is a complete falsehood .
but i 'm not cheap , you know that ? loud , but never cheap .

i work a single , which means there 's no replacement -- no second man on the cab . six to six , sometimes eight . seventy-two hours a week .
i do n't know , i guess the outfits are cool . and i want a big gun .

this is private property . the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge .
inside every semi-conductor ... you have two particles , with opposite charges , separated by an impassable barrier ...

ohhh , i hate this .
sorry .
are you afraid ?
no , thanks ...
i ca n't say anything , i 'm sorry .
you will go alone .
if i had seen a ghost at your age , i would have been frightened out of my wits .
it 's like the last time . he sent me a present before he --
you just come on with that three fifty and martini will take care of himself ... your dice , scanlon .
that 's cheating ?
mike found a red pickup abandoned on flanders . you see it ?
i 'll be back in about an hour . watch the register while i 'm gone , okay ?

had one , now i 'm fucked again .
do n't get excited , peter . they just asked a civil question .
tell him , as far as i 'm concerned , he finds something it 's his .
our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not , shall we say , satisfactory , yes ?
i 'm pretty sure it 's right .
i would like one of my people to help .
you wounded me first , marylin .
that -- or he 's out blazing trails . he 'll show up .
what little boy does n't ... my god ... it 's , it 's ... catwoman .
dad , no . but i did n't want any problems , so i decided not to sleep with him .
you do n't have a headache . i have a headache .
how long 's this going to go on , wilhelm ? i say von der null , you say von der null , i say von der null , you say von der null , we could go on all day . you know who von der null is , do n't you ? edwin von der nuell , music critic .
they 're going to walk right past me .
oh ... where does he live ?
what ! ! ?
no , the problem is one 's dead , one 's got a bullet in his arm , and one wo n't talk . the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up .
why is she in a wheelchair ?
you know sid fletcher ?
i do n't want any more of that shit .
you 're a good man , mr. kringelein -- a very good man .
marge and i are getting married .
sure .
what she doin ' in the van , man ?
it was either that , or a sardine .
we have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around ... so we can swim to it ... .
it looks fine . how much will it be , with my car ... ?
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back ? is that correct , o'neil ?
that 's not enough .
damn right , it gets us out from under suspension . we 'll get those new routes to pittsburgh and boston and the equipment we need . we 're gon na compete with the big boys now .
let 's just say that i am out to make some radical changes . now come on charles . for old times sake , for your sake ... leave him to me .
i know you --
well , maybe he 's only looking out for your best interests .
oh ?
only my share .
i 'm not so sure . my father and i have n't spoken in three years . when my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack , that he 'd locked himself in the bathroom , all the way going over i was thinking how i was gon na tell him what a bastard he was . then when i got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed , i thought of all these other things i wanted to say .
damn , i knew i forgot something .
i would venture , with all respect : the emperor 's health is the business of every soul in the empire .
dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and adam . out back we 'd light 'em up . the three of us . we 'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light . sparks . and dad would be all ... `` get ready '' ... '' watch for it '' ... '' here it comes , '' here comes the `` wahoo '' .
over the edge of the world .
sometimes she gets me so crazy , i 'd like to split her head with a razor .
yes , you do !
do you do this kind of thing a lot ? i mean , is this like a hobby ?
hi .
i 'm not going to marry him . i just went out with him once . i know ! why do n't we go to the movies tonight . just us girls . it 'll be fun .
where was this ?
he was my blood -- and i demand to know what happened to him .
1989. six years for you . there 's the sign ! right here !
right now . guess who 's been buying coke from him for the last five and half years ?
i think he 's a sick fuckin ' maniac ! we 're awful goddamn lucky he did n't tag us , when he shot up the place . i came this fucking close - to taking his ass out myself . everybody panics . when things get tense , everybody panics . everybody . i do n't care what your name is , you ca n't help it . it 's human nature . but ya panic on the inside . ya panic in your head . ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic , then you get a grip and deal with the situation . what you do n't do , is shoot up the place and kill everybody .
agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve , ma . we just do n't pretend we know .
he did ?
i ca n't talk now .
not bad , not bad .
oh , my god ...
i 'm sorry ?
i hate to see any man swing . bad luck .
we ca n't just walk out on her without saying goodbye .
well ... i 'm for it ...
okay --
wait .
what ? ... why ?
i know you .
oh , that ? it 'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so . your mouth needs the rest . bye .
< i > a show. < /i > then who am i ?
what is its antidote ?
keep talking , i 'll find you !
aw , c'mon . do n't say that .
really ? the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought 'hey -- i know where anna scott is . she 's in that house with the blue door in notting hill . ' and then you go out in your goddamn underwear .
whatever ... they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build el computer grande ... skynet ... for the government . right ?
i never said nothin ' about nothin ' like that . no , no , no . that 's not what i wrote to you .
it 's the only way we can make enough to put ho-jon through androscoggin .
you guys are playing music ?
that nobel prize will just have to wait .
not at all . i , this guy here , he 's sonny chiba .
yeah , i saw it .
awake ? what do you mean ?
you could say that .
what ?
a year 's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that 's not so bad , you know .
you did that for me , and on the last day of your holidays ?
no , i 'm on top of it ...
you said you were here all day ?
in twenty-four hours , zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test ... from a missile silo in montana . if i 'm right , the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship .
there is some allusion here that escapes me ...
did you ever steal a car before ?
come on , we 'll get a cup of coffee ...
i 've heard some foolish things in my life .
i 'm a little hungry , maybe i 'll order something . joe . get me some bracciole or something . and pay cash . and in return for these concessions , what do you do for me ?
after god ... before the waste-paper basket .
so why did you dial it again ?
you were n't at my game .
condolences . how you fixed for cabbage this mornin ' ?
why ?
i never drink in the morning . and every time you send my shipment over , it 's always just a little bit short .
what the hell happened ?
hmmm . claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her . i told her that was n't true , i just knew the event horizon better , that 's all .
do n't matter . first time i 'll be late in nine years . no great trouble..whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time ... do n't matter ... the world is in this room , baby . this is all there is and all there needs to be .
are you done ?
he 's not a stag hound . his name is kelly and he 's a police dog .
i seem to have touched a nerve . do n't be so sensitive , pops , let 's keep this friendly . but you 're right , enough with the getting to know you shit . now , there 's two ways we can play this hand . one way is me and you go round an ' round all fuckin ' night . the other way , is we reach some sort of an understanding . now , if we go down that first path at the end of the day , i 'll win . but we go down the second , we 'll both win . now , i do n't give a rat 's ass about you or your fuckin ' family . y'all can live forever or die this second and i do n't care which . the only things i do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back , and our money . and right now i need to get those three things into mexico . now , stop me if i 'm wrong , but i take it you do n't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice , or the bank getting its money back . right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter , your son and possibly yourself . am i correct ?
well , i hope she was n't too much of a disappointment to you , lou .
i 'm sure you 've examined my record . so you know i 've never yet been late on a bridge .
why , that 's perfectly dreadful . are n't you ashamed of yourself ?
< u > fag..a < /u > < u > fag < /u > < u > you < /u > < u > say ! ? < /u > ... < u > '' curst < /u > < u > wolf ! < /u > < u > thy < /u > < u > fury < /u > < u > inward < /u > < u > on < /u > < u > thyself < /u > < u > pray < /u > < u > and < /u > < u > consume < /u > < u > thee ! `` < /u >
my wife used to call me lenny .
oh , yeah ?
but you 've got me doing everything . mama never used to make me dry the ...
just give me a straight answer , walter , cause the irony goes right over my head .
what 's going on ?
will you take me home ?
do n't recognize him . you were trapped by morgana 's sorcery .
i do n't think you 're very polite .
you know what was in hell when i came down here , cassius ?
ca n't talk right now .
of course he 's stealing from me , we 're in business together . what is this ? i 'm sitting here , suddenly everybody 's talking like this is something bad . we take from each other , we take from the army , everybody uses everybody , it works out , everybody 's happy .
i know who you are . kinda out of your neighborhood , are n't you ?
suppose they did . how does it concern you ?
me neither . how 'bout you carrie ?
i do n't think so , mrs. mulwray . of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information , we 'll be in touch .
so you do n't mind ?
i understand .
i 'll find something else . see you in court some day .
finally , your new watch : blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks ; press this button , the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter .

yes . she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you , as have we all .
let 's see if you 've gotten any better .
your call .
do n't say anything else .
what 're you getting at ?
no , man . i 'm gon na bail .
we took all the chances . the money belongs to us , not him !
they got the guys on a < u > retainer < /u > , it 's cheaper , < u > pay < /u > 'em , but do n't lettem touch it ... let'em leave us alone .
what , you mean as friends ?
that was n't very nice of you , john . have a heart , boy .

goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year .
you must chill ! you must chill ! i have hidden your keys . chill !
what does this have to do with.. ?
what are you talking about ?
and we ca n't purge the chiefs . our invasion talk will look like a bluff . or even that there 's been an attempted coup .
you a fag too ?
why ?
we could , if i 'm not in jail .
do n't be afraid . do what i told you and you 'll be okay .
unfiltered .
not at all .
... they sound what ?
we 're very specialized .
but when you finlsh a job , afterwards do you think about them ?
mmm.hmm .

i can tell you exactly .

i get nervous , that 's all i know .
a man whose life was empty !
you do good work , alice .
she 's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood .
they 're not bad .
what happened ?
he 's not there . but look what i found in his room
oh that 's easy , you just got ta find the clitoris .
i 'm really glad you 're doin ' okay , pete .
so what ? where are they gon na go ?
someone crying . a girl . i thought i was crazy .
and what was that other one you did , the one where you 're the jogger ?
yeah , was n't i ?
did n't you tell me that debi rutlege had just moved into her place also ?
gaff rigged ? why not a staysail schooner ? go anywhere . look at this -- the mayan , an alden schooner .
they 've got the real thing outside .
what are you talking about ? danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block . i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week . and hank says danny 's moved to new york . to better himself .
what ?
what does the manager say ?
i 'll tell her .
you mean quit ?
i do n't think you 're old and fat enough for me .
how 'd you unlock my phone ?
not .
i do n't know ... maybe . think of it as an adventure .
yes .
there have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years . i 've followed each one of them ... a seven-three-seven crashes on take off . one hundred and seventy-two die . no survivors ... a hotel fire downtown . two hundred and eleven die . no survivors ... and am amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city . one hundred and thirty one die . one survivor . he is unharmed . i 've spoken with your husband about his survival . i suggested a rather unbelievable explanation . since then , i 've come to believe , that my explanation , however unbelievable , is in fact , true .
why do n't you stay and watch the fun ? you 'll enjoy it immensely .
sounds like a rough time .
i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide . life seems so much not worth the living , death such an easy way out .
what are you talking about ? she hated you ! you hated her ! what are you smiling at ?
so what 's wrong with her ?
we could be together again --
patrick . turn on the light . he turns on the light .
has paul heard about his promotion ?
i do n't have an official response , michael . all i have are the same questions you have .
he sleepwalks , you idiot ! he 's fully capable of walking out of this hospital . oh my god ... he thinks i 've gone home ...
what are you talking about ?
erin . i 'll always be with you .
your parents would be crushed to think you were n't happy with it .
where you going to live , then ?
but it is what you 'd like me to do . so tell me to do it..
yeah , as a matter of fact they did . come on in .
now what ?
a homosexual scandal , you mean ? for me to answer a question of that magnitude , you 'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks .
yes i do ! i know exactly what i am saying . and if it is sedition , then i am guilty of sedition , too !
i 'm doing an interview .
just think about one thing right now : what color ?
you go to patpong ? see smoke from pussy , ping pong ball from pussy , razor blade from pussy ; bird from pussy .
or the vitamins ? or the ... ?
guilty . i am .
hi , buddy-boy . what happened to you ?
do n't quibble . you know what i mean .
okay : this may sound crazy , but --
well , what 's going on ?
what a waste of lives and opportunities and --
beth , stop it !
actually i was trying to catch up on my reading . there 's a lot of dickens i never got around to --
ask him about the air . he looks out of breath .
i stay here because i am happy . is that such a terrible crime ?
amy 's been lying again .
your his publicist ?
i know --
sure .
... when did you know ?
so this is what , a test ?
no , sid .
oh yeah , i remember now .
and i 'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me .
okay . okay . i 'll bet there 's ... look at this .
-- uplink all relevant files to kim -- -- and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone --
hello , mrs. robinson .
do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood ?
did mr. marsh change his lifestyle after that ?
well , you 're not . oil and vinegar ?
... well , you know me , amy , at least better than that that dame does . do you think i 'm an imbecile ?
yes , but , joe , < u > joe 's < /u > been , well , he 's just been having a few , uh , `` thoughts , '' about ...
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared . i was n't lucky .
friends from cornell ...
well , that 's why you got it .
i 'll make you another one .
we 're expecting brown this afternoon , ma'am .
let me tell you a few things about you dad , okay ? he 's very very very clever , very very brave , and he loves you ever very much .
your mother will be down in a few minutes .
you were well adjusted to my being dead ?
i know that .
do you have to call me that ?
hmmm ?
jeff , if you 're squeamish , just do n't look .
whatever ! it 's no dig on you , archer , but this story is hot and you 're no longer on top of it . why , it 's the scoop of the century -- the other papers wo n't have the gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- the allemeinischer zeitung , le figaro , they 'll be choking on our dust come mornin ' --
i 'll be back .
they 're not paying me anything . they 've already warned you twice ; this is the last warning . decide .
should n't we examine their personal effects ?
i 'll pay for it .
dr. jaffe has pinned her ears back .
oh , no i 'm not . these heathens probably have an open grave for us .
ai n't a-goin ' , thas all ...
is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
what way would you put it ?
for who ? the fish ?
caitlin used to talk about him all the time .
oh please annette . you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love . well here it is . right in front of you , but you 're going to turn your back on it . i 'm sorry that we 're not at the age where we can get married . if we were , i 'd propose , but that 's not going to happen . so i guess we 're just fucked . i 'll move on , but you ... you 're going to have to live with yourself knowing you 've turned your back on love . and that makes you a hypocrite .
i ca n't do it , walt .
you 're the reason , jack , i do n't keep all my money in banks .
it 's already been negotiated . it 's done . the money is there waiting .
yes , i did .
it 's all over , paul .
oh . that was just one of those idle questions . one does n't expect an answer .
and are n't you pleased ? ... that way you 'll have a new kind of adventure .
what are you doing ?
the worm on the hook again .
well . i suppose it does a bit . i 'm very happy for them , of course , but i 'm going to miss them . the ship will seem ... incomplete without them .
going out on the 'aurora . '
alright . in the shop you mentioned something about --
seventeen percent , huh ? sounds big .
oh , god !
that 's a quarter of a century . makes a girl think .
okay , this is important ...
seems to me he got himself fragged . i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent . maybe a rumor . helluva man -- remarkable officer . walter kurtz woulda been a general some day . general of the army . shit , head of the joint chiefs of staff . did you knew kurtz ?
you know , tom , i feel a little proud when people comment on your looks . maybe you should feel that way .
you will see . a coupla months , you gon na be an old lady , sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law 's house .
you do have your moments ... not many , but you do have them .
no way .
the penitent man . the penitent ...

g'day , they say it 's worth three grand ...
but rache ...
your mother 's pastor .

they haul gas in tanker trucks , they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they do n't haul viruses in tanker trucks .
you little fuck .
why not ? you heard my voice ?
he 's giving them up ?
here you go ! no pushing !
they could kill you .
my uncle used to say ... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects .
thanks . good night , mrs. mitchell .
you did n't volunteer , jackson .
i still have one left ...
clair is a hovering mother .
rational ? ! love is not rational ! are you crazy ?
calm down ! calm down !
no , m'lord .
do n't put it in your pocket . it 's your lucky quarter .
telephone call ? who 's got time for that ?
what 's that , sol ?
and that makes anything you do ok , is that it ?
i guess you 'll find out .
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure , it gets all of the worm 's memories .
yeah , well he 's still here . i think him and jerry are fast becoming buddies , you know jerry ... yeah , he 's got ta see everything ... yeah , i know ... thinks there 's some unsolved mystery around every corner .
i do n't think anything in the world could make me say that .
ah yes , a rare renaissance piece . da vinci 's `` sforza , '' an equestrian model of a never executed statue . i consider it to be the prize of tonight 's auction of objets d'equestrian . horse things .
well , i figure if you take a state policeman , shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk , it 's best to just get on out of the state if you can .
are you frightened ?
at what intervals does he whistle ?
bring the warp core on-line . i 'll lay in a heading .
why ?
and what about the suicide note ? you did n't write that , either !
where are you ?
how many ?
do you have to get your hooks into every guy i 'm interested in ?
what is it ?
for what it 's worth now , harold ryan , the clown , gives his sacred word .
so ?
i ca n't get sick . you know -- training and all . i 'm gon na be late .
i see . and now you catch ghosts ?
well , you 're going to have a problem carrying on , aintcha .
i do n't want to take you out of your way .
yes , i 'm all tears , now let 's see who 's inside , shall we ?
come on , everybody ! we got ta run for those rocks over there !
i say , is there any one person suspect in these acts ?
you said you loved me ! you fuck ! i hope you die !
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...
... on the line and this guy 's out havin ' the time of his life . he has every cop in the state watchin ' him , and he 's out playin ' golf .
of course !
not anymore . now i 'm the laziest damn cat burg -- i 'm going to take it so straight that i wo n't tape a mets game without the expressed written consent of the national baseball league .
something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to ?
i believe not , ma'am . i understand -- he 'd had rather too much to drink .
i know . i 'm just saying i understand .
-- you lose either way , price --
does n't satisfy , eh ? well -- that 's too bad ... .
not interested .
yes .

i 'll give you seventy-five bucks for it .
i 'm sorry . i wish ... people could apologize for other people .
suppose you 've had all you can of sierra . what with that ruckus you had with toby . oh yes , i heard all about that .
send them out !
dr. milo , please do n't call my wife mad .
then you can write anywhere . let 's get out of here , while we still can .
maybe i 'd better go before i catch something .
that comes from not holdin ' you tight *enough . *
i 'll just clear up here , and then dress .
no .
it 's true . birdson knew your name , he was writing it in numerical code . it was n't easy but i figured it out . it spelled your name .
we 'll know in forty seconds . only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy .
then what ?
no .
so you come out with her robinson's/may bag , go meet sheronda . simone peeks out , waits for my man louis here to give her a signal nobody 's watchin ' . she leaves the store , gets in her car -- mission accomplished .
i sure hope this is n't permanent .
something to do with a butterfly -- they were quarreling about it .
i think we oughtta practice it , just so you know what to expect .
it 's not what you think . darn it . i 'm going out on a story . the secretary of defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid 's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he 'd rather duck .
jeanne , let me introduce the king 's half brother , the dogged lord dunois .
ambrose . i know .
it 's twelve-thirty !
no . no , no .
is it good ?
is this what you call the `` butler '' ?
he lost all the weight ... there .
yeah , no , she 's a go-getter , all right .
what ?
really , which one ? i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes .
where i 'm going you can not follow .
not if they all die at once .
'fish ' ?
i wo n't ask again .
i 'm in the picture on wendy 's wall . niagara falls . family trip . little wendy foreground . me background . what are the odds on that one ?
you boys seem to think you 've got a champ in there , huh ?
what are you talking about ? she 's a nice girl .
this has got to be a mistake .
grady tripp . english department .
so we kill him ?
what did you say ?
where 'm i going ?
i had to park two blocks away . is something -
unwell ?
there 's a hawk around . they 're scared tonight .
wha-at ? come on , there 's another t.v . in the kitchen . you know you used to have a sense of humor .
and you liked fucking him , did n't you , you fat little whore ?
have n't you got another pew - not so close to the band ? how about that one ?
you know , i think you 're right . i 'm just too adorable .
what are you talkin ' about ?
call me later .
do n't pay any attention to him . it 's very good .
gold , eh ?
then do you understand that i can not tell the truth here ? in dallas . that there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth ... who do not want me to have a retrial ?
it 's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered .
he 's essential . without him , everything comes to a grinding halt . if that happens -
basquiat , what did you take ?
but do n't worry ... we 'll be in heaven . the real heaven , i mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .
no , stay .
what about these two ?
it 's getting cold .
except i wo n't have a father anymore .
you think this is all very funny .
you coward !
okay , my sweet . good night .
who are you revolting against ?
no , i 'll go . you stay ... in case she wakes up .
he 's *paralyzed* !
i do n't have a goddamn credit card .
sorry i 'm late . jenny 's basketball game went into overtime . if anybody ever told me i 'd have a daughter who 'd get a triple double , i 'd ...
i 'm lucky i got a broom . work up top . real easy job . man , it 's gon na be hot down in that ditch .
sure . what is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices ?
grouchy ?
that 'll never work . they 'll just think you 're crazy .
snatches the morphine from sarge . quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot . he 's done this before .
yeah ... guy lombardo ...
morning , captain .
oh shut up . all we did was talk . my attack had nothing to do with him .
captain -- i might have a way to find them .
charming chap .
the first one was , but the rest sucked .
and i you .
that 's the point . you play < u > between < /u > the notes , you dance < u > around < /u > the structure , you improvise . some people know where they 're going to be ten years from now . same job , same neighbors , same shit over and over . that 's not living . that 's dying a little every day . not me , pal . it 's not knowing what 's around the corner that makes like worth living . that 's jazz . that guy up there , he knows what i 'm talking about . hell , it 's the same thing < u > he 's < /u > talking about , if you just open your ears . you can hear it in the conversation he 's having with that trumpet ...
you 're not rotting meat .
i ca n't hide anymore . i breathe like a dog . i lose my balance . stealing 's got harder . caravaggio stares at the herodotus .
what ?
-- we could bum around the world for a year on that .
no thanks .
you see ? we 're both innocent , nick .
yes , they are .
all done , chief..
hey . tits . i 'm taking your neighbor to the country . maybe something for you too .
she 's buried .
uh , alex , we 've only know each other one day .
i 'm sorry , but it 's important . clay shaw is important . i 'm sorry .
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man .
they are in tune . but not with each other .
where is your mother ?
nothing . i dropped the soap . that 's all .
okay , fine , you 're full a shit , i 'm full a shit .
donnie darko , perhaps , given your recent brush with mass destruction , you can give us your opinion ?
i do n't believe that . lao motions to grange with the killing blade . grange relaxes his deathgrip on the crow . move in close on eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief .
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition .
oh . well , hang in there , amigo .
what are you doing up here ?
go to hell !
you have a lovely voice .
a regular tropo ... spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit , living off nickel and dime grants . you want to be a bum all your life , be my guest . not me . i 'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot ... .
tseirp a si eh ! eno on ma i ! eno on ma i ! ahhhhhhhhhhh !
oh , you ...
i do n't know .

i could have done it better . i 'm a fucking ball-buster i am .

we 'll see about that .
perhaps these are the ones mapes told us of .
sure , walter . thanks .
are you okay ?
something wrong , man ? you look a little whiter than usual .
no , i 'm not . i 'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like i 'm doing the extra credit problems . mr. bender does n't bother to check homework past april .
you mean you need a witness in addition to white ... ?
it 's so bad she becomes a werewolf .
that 's the good news ?
what ?
yes , my lord .
supportive ? you were n't being supportive . you were being scared . just like now . you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on .
do you have a fella ?
yeah . yeah , right , i 'm mad . what 'd you tell her , for christ sake ?
uh -- the taft hotel .
yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum .
not on your feet too much ?
what 's up ?
linda king 's desk .
that 's crazy . i 'll get you some applications .
milo ? shrot suspects somebody broke into # 21. i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts .
you could start over again with cash like that .
too many stairs .
not too active .
... shit .
you 're early ... it 's not ready . what happened ?
here we go .
my father !
we 'd love to transition a gay guy into the group .
this is all that survived ?
i thought i was just gon na be connected to talk to a girl - that 's fine , ok , i 'm sorry , it 's , um ... ..818 ... .
hey ! will you slow down ! when did you learn how to drive ?
the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man . karl wo n't talk to women .
yeah , i just came in . i decided not to park here .
certainly frank . darling , get some glasses . we 'll have some beer with frank . wo n't you sit down ?
ai n't nobody stole dad 's skiff .
four hundred ! do you want to bankrupt this administration ?
i 'm sorry , i 'm a little nervous . it 's my first time in new york . just a minute .
she is not your birth mother , is she ?
okay , look . i 'm going to work really , really hard on this one . but , please stop with the pressure . i 'm already tense as it is .
it 's okay , it 's okay .
daddy , i --
i 'm sorry , i do n't understand .
why do n't you take off your clothes , mike ?
i was the warden ?
i have someone for you to play with junior .
you know , he has n't harmed any of us . far as i can tell , he has n't even lied to us . just stick to the deal , johns . let him go if that 's what it --
what is `` true ? '' i 've never heard my father say a single true thing .
yeah , hurry up .
yeah . i 'm thinking about micheal 's franco harris fixation . you know how micheal was always harping `` immaculate reception ? '' i 've seen that play . a lot of times ... and i have to say this ... franco was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that 's it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ?
you mean if just one person gets killed ?
i do n't guess .
struggling , why ?
i 'm always alone -- i have been everything .
i 'm not a kid anymore , i ca n't be all over the map --
i 'll be the judge of that .
what for ?
maybe he 's just a < u > patriot < /u > .
it 's niiice .
kind of funny , i thought he 'd be pissed as hell at me .
-- `` oh , no , officer , i 'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- what ? what do you mean he 's dead ? it 's all my fault , i may as well have killed him myself ! ''
okay , joke about it . i do n't give a shit .
she grabbed you ? impossible . the precogs are n't even aware of us . in the milk all they see is the future .
i have plenty of friends .
i 'll get it . stay right here . you look very good in the sun ...
i did n't do anything .
sit down , they 're still talking to agent scully .
just get her drunk .
did n't see 'im , mama . the other men there say they did n't know daddy .
carlson ? is he new here ?
yeah ?
now you finish locking up , will you , carl ?
guess what '' s under these coconuts .
you want to know -- now -- ? here ? red , white , whatever -- guys are all the same .
thank you , captain .
witch .
no !
so ... if the hull 's impregnable why are my feet wet ?
good guess -- but no .
it 's gon na be close . real close .
do n't know that it does .
i 'm only sorry that i did n't play better for you . i know it would 've made you happy . you know what you are ?
go away -- go away .
but i do n't know how to polka .
i got fired .
dorothy ! dorothy ! we 're busy !
let 's assume that it is .
i just want this over with .
no , i do n't believe i know anyone by that name .
wow , you must a found the c.o. , eh ?
not the compromised second draft . and then i , uh . . . ever hear of the seattle seven ?
so what happened ? did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
who , me ? oh , no ! do n't bother about me ! we 're not hurt ! is n't that right , skipper ?
what ? what movie ?
just be natural , goddamit .
v'asitem lechem pessel to-monat . and make no graven image of the lord , or the form of any figure , or of man or woman , or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything . because he 's not like anything . not only ca n't you see him or hear him , you ca n't even think about him . i mean , what 's the difference between that and him not existing ?
why the hell you wan na go up to nu mung ba for ?
are you satisfied now ?
now , you know where you 're going ? down there , through those trees , follow the river . you 'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . willow , this is serious business . do n't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a nelwyn . give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can .
mary dawson , huh ? mary dawson , my eye . that dame took you for a sleigh ride that new york will laugh about for years . she 's the slickest , two- timing , double-crossing ?
this town ai n't big enough for the two of us !
could take a little while , though .
yeah . mac threw cobb out again .
no , i 'm dumber than a goddamn slug . now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado ?
yep .
he found out his partner , tan , had been working for the triads all along . before my father could prove it , he was killed in the line of duty .
uh huh .
what the hell does this have to do with insurance ?
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant . it 's business . there 's no emotion involved in business ... if you want to survive .
what happened to dick wilson ?
i had to lay eyes on you .
i 'm such a loser .
yeah , he wants us to talk to buddy , set up a meeting .
reverend mother -- thank-you .

that 's boring !
no shit ? fuck it . i 'll send it to oliver stone then . he 'll get them to reopen the bastard .
jesus . you 're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m ...
you 're not someone who lies very easily ... so it 's obvious when you do ... at least to me .
remember me ? i 'm the fellow you slept on last night .
oh , sure . now you want to blame your fuckin ' license on me , is that it ?
yeah , i was there .
how 's our friend ?
ah , he 's always too heavy on the vinegar . if you really want a good one , you got ta let me make it .
if i pay homage to another 's throne , then how am i a king ?
here 's the problem ... `` seen cooing over calamari with notsonew sugar daddy was jessica rabbit ... wife of maroon star , roger '' . his wife 's a tramp , but he thinks she 's betty crocker . the doubt 's eatin ' him up .
i 'm trying , sir . stand by ...
what am i supposed to do ? ! i saw one of my oldest friends get killed ! and i saw who did it ! i ca n't just -- `` let it go away '' ! !
these were killers . conklin had them all jacked up . they were dobermans .
me and you are gon na have a talk .
i do n't know . i think i 've lost my mother , paul d .
to be precise , they did n't blow up the tracks .
did you come here with wally -- to *not* watch movies ?
oh , yes , i forgot : it 's your occupation , is n't it ?
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit .
this brothers is gon na be a colossal event . we 'll shut the mother down right at the capitol , in front of the cameras . will you cool it ? what 's up man ? what it be bobby ?
do n't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me , randall . i 'm the jane that was left , and you 're the jim that did the leaving . so save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes . the only reason i ride with you , is cause i do n't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps !
you 're saying stay away from him .
where are you , scully ?
the bees killed thomas j , and i killed my mother .
yes , griff ?
let 's do it on the coats . it 'll be excellent .
i suppose , `` mister president , '' you 're unhappy that we have not implemented your domestic intelligence plan , but ...
after the funeral i just had to leave .
hi , bobo .
what are you doing ?
look , doctor !
thank you .
... and he thought he 'd clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper ... and then maybe borrow $ 200 or $ 20,000 , or $ 200,000 ...
what ?
... well , you know , not counting the first table .
i was worried when we could n't get in touch with you in that hick town .
hurray for us . did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated ? no , you would n't say that . they do n't count .
i 'd rather not , mrs. robinson .
start the grinders .
i thought i told you boys to go to bed !
extra money , huh ?
evidently to install bugs and photograph documents .
sorry i 'm late , i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's .
do n't do it , rob !
he 's funny -- maybe you can use him in the show , mr. denby .
actually --
no .
listen , you can kick 'em , hit 'em , pour water all over 'em -- < u > nothing < /u > . i 'm telling you , under ordinary conditions they 're < u > quiet < /u > , they 're nice to have around , they 're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle ... ... then look out .
i know that ...
i 've been dreaming about you .
yeah , i 'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out . there 's nothing else .
oh , how do you do ?
huh ?
let 's keep it that way , shall we ?
yes .
i 've took as much of you as any man can
jamie ! get away !
do you really mean it ?
long as we do n't lose heart , jack ...
we 're working on it .
last year was awful rough -- mama passing on and the whole business with o.j. -- i mean it 's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys , but it really knocked me for a loop --
they 're giving out . de-crystallizing .
you are .
orsino単ood name
you think i 'm dumb . you think all models are dumb .
oh , and by the way , i think it 's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder .
your older brother .
that 's an unwise thing to say , you know that ?
what kind of truck ?
some kind of signaling .
just smile .
... ting the ruby slippers ?
you know i do .
thank you , officer ripley . that will be ...

i 'm not sure .
you can break it , ca n't you ?
'i like him ' ? diane , i 'm talking about being honest with people , being decent ...
sections of rooms made of plywood . our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster . the digital conveyor was christmas lights ... decorations . it 's all a fake . i 'm not him ... i 'm a nothing . a nobody .
yes , i have a dictionary . but i ca n't understand for the life of me why you would call her that ! or why cliff would say that about you .
as if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her , as that name 's cursed hand did murder her kinsman .
great . excellent . thanks .
okay , he 's on base . can we talk about my life now ? -- ike 's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that i was never serious about gill , blah blah . he 's totally out to get me .
`` liebestraum . ''
hell , why not just shoot her ? why not shoot everybody . fuckin ' shoot me . shoot the fuckin ' president ?
i am not a wealthy woman .
the kid 's right .
let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night i left . he 's coming home to marry me .
how dare you think i 'm in a position to be pressured ...
i 'm joe riggins . sit down
do n't you understand ? the mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events , and changing history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear .
i 'll see what i can do .
is that a pretty good job , fbi agent ?
clayton is fine .
nice piece of work , fox . why do n't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room ?
joey ...
why should we submit ourselves to their domination ?
i 'll wait till after the children .
well , tell them to mind their damn business . you 're smart enough to get a degree .
you would ! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power .
yes .
... fix themselves .
but ... this disease ... is progressive ... degenerative ...
he might be interested ... but it would mean another five thousand .
paperwork on the detroit thing . it 's a full dossier . very comprehensive .
none of them had any --
i 've lived in l.a. all my life , i 've never done this drive .
why today ? and why 'd she have to go with him ?
well that 's very nice of you .
maybe we could try it this way .
hello ?
wow , dude . wendy could really give a rats ass about you .
- in this case , apparently , as trustworthy as the world almanac !
one hour .
you built an old mill in new hampshire ...
if i did n't put it on somebody else would ! i was his friend !
what if our guys open up , sir ?
swann 's wife .
well ... i 've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , i 've been picked up before . okay .
like hell they ca n't . they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on .
well , i hope you do n't expect more .
it looks like a converted church .
the junior shop stewards . there 's lots of ways we can help .
what 's wrong .

big talk ... desperate guy .
i always tell everyone the same thing . i got rolled and beat up real bad recently , and since then it 's two for one , an ' i work strictly in tandem with betty ...

yeah .
stay smart , bud . we build a case . we play by the rules .
well , what are they ?
not at all .
all right , go ahead ! we go on to the next plane . bring out any people that are left .
you could n't have made that jump .
really ? both of you ? ... why not ?
it 's okay . it 's okay .
sign up .
well , i 'd like to leave a message , if that 's okay .
i feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision . not that i blame them . how could they know ? today 's world is so complicated . no . i have to go away now . i 'm sorry , lotte . i 'm so sorry .
i 've done that already . he should appear , you know . it does n't look well ... his staying away at a time like this .
yep .

treadstone .

our place , clell miller 's , sammy johnston , the creeders . will hite .
i am willing to apologize ... i 'm willing to do anything to prevent this war .
you saw kat in new york ... ... or is she in town ? is she in town ... ?
but i 'm going to give it up for adoption . i already found the perfect people .
it 's bona fide !
yes , well , i awoke to discover i 'd turned into a cat . if you do n't do as i say , i 'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks , and suck the marrow straight out of your bones .
raise 5,000 .
an artist of your caliber ...

i will sit with you . i ca n't sleep either .
sollozzo is a dead man , i do n't care what it costs . i do n't care if we have to fight all the five families in new york . the tattaglia family 's going to eat dirt . i do n't care if we all go down together .
it 's not your decision and he 's not your brother , dignan .
what are you talking about ?
you do that .
nicky comes on sunday 's .
what else ? from virginia ?
i ca n't do that , ralph , because somebody already brushed her off once tonight .
that goes for all of you . now eat with your correct hands .
did they win ?
from yourself , admiral .
-- i guarantee she wo n't gain an once . she 's very disciplined .
just your age .
it does n't have to be . everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin , you 'll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails .
what ? oh . i used to do gymnastics . are you looking for someone ?
i know . i know that . do n't spoil it .
i know . but it 's an emergency . somebody dying . okay ?
louis , look at me .
yes . 1988. he was furious at the british plan to return hong kong , and supposedly started his own negotiations with the chinese government . the inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn mi-6 a rather powerful enemy -
because ... you 're ... you 're the gods ... .
i 'm gon na hit you !
i knew what you meant .
oh , no . i would never think it ! it 's so beautiful . you are so ... i 'll give it a place of honor , here , next to my mother .

yes , poor jason . as we speak he 's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on . while here i sit eating christmas cheese in spring .
do you know that jungle ?
what feelings ?
you 're pathetic , man . when 's the last time you had some fun ? when 's the last time you took a night off , had a date ?
or the bijou . either one .

your parents are always going away for the weekend . you 're so lucky .

excuse me ?
who ?
you were awfully good .
i promise . someday . when i 'm really supposed to .
... yes ?
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity .
sure , what have you got ?
we 'll take it !
dad , i never knew you had a sense of humor .
franky ca n't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he 's going to see you later . i 'm mickey morrissey , we 're supposed to get to know each other .
why ?
it is n't a story - it 's true . i did see wynant . he 's not dead .

you must get lonely . you ever think about , you know ...
they 're all the same , but each one is different from every other one . you 've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings . you 've got your summer light and your autumn light . you 've got your weekdays and your weekends . you 've got your people in overcoats and galoshes , and you 've got your people in shorts and t-shirts . sometimes the same people , sometimes different ones . and sometimes the different ones become the same , and the same ones disappear . the earth revolves around the sun , and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle .

they came and found me . they said they 'd kill me unless i help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . dump your gun on the floor .
i thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues . they do n't let everybody in .

look , i just wanted to say , i think it 's great you 're riding again . and ... and i think i know why you , you needed to do it alone ... without anyone knowing ...
never knew my father . i grew up with my mother . actually , i grew up around my mother . she was great though . i mean , the way she was with her friends ... she was this woman who had so much life in her , she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us . [ beat ] she died young .
thanks , king . i 've always wanted to take one of these big babies in .

where are you ?
do n't forget our mission , shinzon . we should act . now . time is running out .
`` speaking '' ! reeking , seeking , creaking ... freaking !
then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys ?
the television said they 've started with the looting already . vultures .
a vacuum , edmund . that 's what we have in los angeles . sending mickey cohen up created it . my containment work maintained it . certain photographs guarantee it . organized crime has been held back , but there 's still a demand for the services it provides .
yes ?
what are you talking about ?
he 's somewhere ...
turn around quick !
it 's cool ... but , i do n't know ... i went to a shrine today and all these little monk 's were chanting ... and , i did n't feel anything ... i even tried ikebana , ... and john 's using hair products ... i do n't know who i ?

oh .
a drink ...
see you later .
he said i was right . i should n't wait for him . i was better to make a clean break .
what am i worried about ? he 'll probably be glad i started the ball rolling . all he ever did was complain about her anyway . i 'm just looking out for his best interests . i mean , that 's what a friend does , am i right ? i did him a favor .
just one . the bar 's closed .
of course you have a case ! now , i want you to go with my assistant , iris , and fill out some forms . she 'll tell you about our fee arrangement . mrs. finley ? any back pain since the accident ? dizziness ? nightmares ?

you trying to be funny ? -- because i 'm all out of laughs . i 'm over a barrel and i need a job .
fair enough . no pressure here , barton , because i respect you , but let me point out a couple of things . one , here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night ? if the show sells out . eighty five million people go to the pictures every week .
i want ice ! who 's got some -- oh , there it is .

greetings , program ...
you said he was dead .
but maybe with a good start i can hit those hand-holds .
a fiasco . a disaster . a boondoggle . an abomination .
well , that 's our life now , is n't it ?
wickwire was there to help . to be my eyes on the inside , to make sure you were getting a fair shot . at least that was the intent .
he needs extreme cold to survive . his cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees .

the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations . whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism . parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random .
my parents have money ...
why did n't you drop any sail ?
hello . i am meryhew saks . the song is called `` murder by numbers . '' the performers are a group called the police . adam here ... ... from behavioral science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note . this is an extremely complex case , and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around . we 're not ruling out the possib- ility of three copycat serial killers . we have quantico working on graphology , the washington lap is cloning dna from the secretor . it 's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims . we have a team sweeping sperm banks . now i want to say a few word to you local people . your commissioner asked for our assistance . the bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police . we could n't catch up on what you people know if we had a year . we have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science ; you have the local savvy . together we can be unbeatable . which one is inspector halloran ?

if it 's a person , why should we go see it ? it 's not like it 's nature or anything . it 's just a person . sometimes people who live in the woods do n't want to be seen . they live in the woods because they 're anti-social , lila . we have to respect that .
okay , i know you 've suffered a terrible loss , and there 's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you , but i urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper , the trips you took , the sights you saw , those days are gone now , but they 'll live on in your heart forever .
what 's this ?
yeah .

taking a cab instead of hiring a limo ?

it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves .
and i say she wo n't ! i 'll not have the scorn of god on this place -- with the smell of fish in it , polluting up the sabbath ! and as for you -- let me tell you , young woman ... !
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world 's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
i 'm running away .
you got a hall of fame arm but you 're pissing it away .
oh , no . you 're more than welcome .
i 'm in close with these guys , it is n't easy , but slowly they 're opening up to me . give me a month and i 'll blow their movement wide open .
this is warrant officer julia osborne , the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator .

why does he wan na see me ?
i 'd send them up , but sadly , i do n't trust the young lady to find you on her own .
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour ?
goodnight .
and tell corrado , too , that i 'm here ... if he wants me . you can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad , and that at this moment , it 's the only thing that interests me . is that clear ?
you 're delbert miles ! you have more clout than some whacked out pilot ! talk to him !
congratulations ! it 's 'happy homes ' for harry and emily weiss of denton .
he asked for will . he said he might call back tonight . i tried to hold him ... i 'm sorry ... he said 'tell graham `` broken mirrors . '' '
well , we 're not discussing rachel 's age either .
there were so many times i did n't think i could last another day . i ca n't even tell you some of the things i thought about .
yeah . okay .
well , i 'll tell you a secret . i kinda like the old gent and i 'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him . it might help him a whole lot . but that 's a side issue -- something i do on my own time .
man , el-rage is el-rage . you know him .
some people prefer it .
i was only talkin ' to her .
he was born fighting . and born hungry .

`` i 'm lowell bergman , i 'm from '60 minutes . ' '' you know , you take the `` 60 minutes '' out of that sentence , nobody returns your phone call . maybe wigand 's right . maybe i 'm hooked . what am i hooked on ? the rush ? `` 60 minutes '' ? what the hell for ? infotainment . it 's so fucking useless , all of it .
but not his body .
why not ?
we all end up dead . it 's only a question of how . and why .
yeah .

is n't it about time you became something else ?
at my age ? do n't be silly .
he 's all doped up .
but why ? there must be some way to make her understand !
lydia liked me , you see . that was the strange part of it . in fact , now that i 'm no longer a threat , we 're very good friends .
right . get back to me on that one . once your plan is worth a shit .
you 'll get no information from me . you have no authority ... the council ca n't hold me !

crime of passion . no premeditation . they show up late . most of our scrambles are flash events like this one . we rarely see anything with premeditation anymore .
hey , what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at trader jon 's ... ? come on , man . you 're about as close to being officer material as me .

some people might .
i want to keep it forever . i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life . do n't you understand -- we 'll lose it if we leave . i ca n't make an entire life disappear to start a new one . all i can do is try to hold onto to both . help me . help me not lose loving you .
it 's his heartbeat .
if it helps bring her back , be my guest ...

come on , doom . what would a company like that want with toontown ?
i could make her another cleopatra ...
transient or resident ?
right . if you believe in god . as a narcissist , viznick could n't blame himself for the alleged murders . he created the voices after the fact . in order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides george viznick and that george viznick needs to pay .
no `` jacques '' . i am the great went .
charlie , i 'm in trouble . you 've got ta help me .

ted , joanna and i used to talk a lot and ... well , she told me a lot of ... ah , things about the two of you .

i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid .
do you want me to draw a picture ?
halloran .
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral .

she the one from santa cruz ?
was n't enough time . generator was out , what ... ? thirty minutes . takes the bastards an hour , maybe two to absorb somebody .
cleaning a rock , otis ? jot it down . as soon as we 're back , he feeds the pets .
oh , i 'm already swooning .
i said i wish i 'd never been born .

time .
i did n't know they had a fight .
... i ran the bio-scan with the dna/rna filter . the results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin ...
[ who 's that ? ]
there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about . things i 've been thinking about -- changes i want to make .
when you 're arrested -- you 're allowed one phone call ? who did you call ?
well ... whatsamatter ? run in with the law ?

heh heh heh heh , same old buddy , always jokin ' around . almost as much of a joker as your daddy . i saw your daddy a coupla years ago , i was up in glenville lookin ' at a motel site . i guess that 's where you 're headed , huh , to see him ?
okay , chaz , i hear you . i 've got you on my board .

i ca n't find you .

saunders said -- this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft -- !
while you were employed at wyant wheeler , you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual , correct ?

i promise , dorothy . i promise .
you know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit .
a coke , if they have it ?
love ? come on , i would n't call it love .
i can play the piano ?
why not ? because of his gibberish about god and the soul ? camouflage -- that 's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you ! and to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill benes ! and you made it possible !
ray .
his wife ?
[ aside to gregory ] is the law on our side , if i say ay ?
no , the stones are mine !
... that filth is better left in the `` sin cities . ''
-- i 'm on it --
you and me both . sal-va-to-re .
during the landing ... when things were at their worst ... owens was at his best . he 's the one who would n't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin .
no . it did n't .
neither .
all these good people have totally been led astray .
we ca n't stay here !
well , the way you were spouting , like ... . `` i do n't believe you , sir ... '' and all that . yeah , it was gear .
that could have been worse .
not for long ...
probably am . forget i brought it up .
... that 's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...
what is with this lake ? it looks black and ... there are no waves or anything .
if only you 'd remained true to our contract ! opiates , for his nerves ! restraints ! the man warrants a bed of nails --
no , we ... got our butts kicked .
it 's so beautiful ... and sad .
the word i got is you hung up your spurs , man . what 's that all about ?
we also provide 24-hour after-sale service . were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die , we would unburden you , you understand ?
the high court of israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned jew . ' his passport 's been invalidated except for return to the u.s. he landed in buenos aires yesterday , offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship . they turned him down .
i need n't keep you any longer , mr. clarendon .
forget about childs . he 's over .
that 's right .
master safety on .
it was more to your wife that i gave it .
oh . . .
fuck this .
my guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young . maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them ... anyway , i thought we could try an experiment .
sandy ? could i talk to you a minute ?
conversation , like certain portions of the anatomy , always runs more smoothly when it 's lubricated .
it was an accident . they got in the line of fire .
no .
by my heel , i care not .
can we keep him ?
have we still got power ?
oh , shit !
we are all of us subject to forces beyond our control , mr brown , even you .
what ?
grandma , look at me !
and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon england 's policies in her own colonies ? to come and go without so much as a `` by your leave . ''
not at all . when i was a boy back on the farm i used to pump my own water .
to begin with , she 's only sixteen years-old .
hey man , you ca n't do that !
hi , alan .
meurice . sorry i did n't show last night .
what for ?
i would n't want that to be misunderstood : my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was , sadly , unable to afford tuition up there . but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes , and they 're names are : macready , horn and langtree among others . i was completely independent financially , and like i said : one sad sack a shit . so what we 're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that 's what most people respond to in `` seduce , '' and at the end of the day ? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it 's about finding what you can be in this world . defining it . controling it and saying : i will take what is mine . you just happen to get a blow job out of it , then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not ? he.he.he .
teddy was killed last night .

we did no impact evaluation . the consequences of ...
a woman ? work .
master ching taught me .
shut it . it 's ma .
at last ! a call ! a cry of distress ... concorde ! brave , concorde ... you shall not have died in vain !
and what we believe is what 's accepted as `` truth '' now , is n't it , owen ? psychiatry -- it 's the latest religion . and we 're the priests -- we decide what 's right and what 's wrong -- we decide who 's crazy and who is n't . ... i 'm in trouble , owen . i 'm losing my faith .
that 's smart . let 's talk about guns and violence .
that 's why we hire scientists ...
victor !
i 'm fine .
will you at least let me stay with you ?
- there is the harmattan , a red wind . which mariners called the sea of darkness . red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of england , producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood . almasy checks to see if katharine is still awake .

what do we find in the desert ? arrow heads , spears . in a war , if you own the desert , you own north africa .

i can understand about the cat killing the first girl . charlie how come told me . all that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything . last night there was nothing to disturb it . just a little girl alone in a cemetery .
hi . sarah knottingham .

rheya ...
he 's dead . he ca n't talk .
why are you driving ? you 're not french , you do n't live here , you do n't know these roads . why are you driving ?
i 'm certain . he was the biggest defense lawyer around . infamous , actually .
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this .
what do you want me to do ?
christ if i should n't know better than to step in soft earth . i 've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old .
he is ? i did n't think you knew dick . how do you know he 's dead ?
betty , i do n't wan na shrivel up alone in some stinking prison . no way . i 've got some professional pride . and i do n't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out .
yes , but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
what was she to you ?
jesse , god - what happened ?
do you have any witnesses , major ?
does norman know ?
goodbye .
have you ever had a single moment 's thought about my responsibilities ? have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers ?
i do n't remember the name . it was near a beach .
i do n't know .
stop that , will you ! those idiots ! so they sprang dunbar ! so what good is it ? he 's still in the compound , is n't he ? how long can he last ? where can they hide him ?
and you 're not really as large and useless as you seem .
could be worse . i do n't know how , but i 'm sure it could .
he thought he could take my place . it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i do n't think he 's man enough to do that .
bye .
i did n't do if for you , anyway . i just ai n't no boot-licking trusty , that 's all .
she wants to make a deal .
would he remember you ?
who did you get it from ?
wh-why 's he ... why 's he up there , mom ?
a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus ?
john ... . how can you ever forgive me ?
quiet ! quiet ! quiet ! down there , damn you . welcome to you . pay no attention , they 're impossible . stop it , you willful things ! come this way . just ignore them . they 're perfectly harmless , just willful . i treat them just like my own children .
well , say it .
ok .
i 'm so sorry to trouble you , but-
let me get this straight : you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
did he tell you where he was going ?
do n't do anything , linda . i 'd rather just forget about it . i do n't even like the guy .
that 's alright , i 'm kinda tired .
he promised me . i swear i 'll never take off this ring until the day --
that 's right . and then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river !
will , you ca n't blame yourself .
i do n't want to .
they work for the people we 're trying to sue . their job is to try to minimize damages . our job , nicole , is to try to maximize them . you have to think of it that way . as people doing their jobs . no good guys or bad guys . just our side and their side .
oh , you ... .
a kipper . or a red herring ? what were they investigating ?
why did n't you come to me ?
how is the children 's progress ?
sir , your limo 's here .
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway .
yeah , well , i 'm getting what i refer to scientifically as `` weird vibes . '' every sensor i 've got is giving me strange readings . i mean , the school has had these machines up here three years and they 've never recorded anything like this .
colon ! do n't !
very well . if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls do n't tell the whole truth of your history ; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them ?
hi !
what 's your name , man ?
your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records , because there wo n't be much left of your face .
are you crazy , ray ?
he was very polite , worth the entire five dollars .
started every game my senior year . not all-american or anything , but not bad . anyway , the real star was my best friend , the quarterback . got taken in the first round .
what if they call him ?
about you and mom ?
now , where is he ?
no . why ?
no , no . strange , i 've never seen anne act that way before . it 's funny i never thought to tell her you were a girl , is n't it ?
fourteen ? fifteen ? your days are running out . how long can you last ? a year . six months ? what happens when you 're sixteen and you go green ?
it 's my bullworker .
i 'll join you later .
was there a definite proposal ?
well , not monumentally .
god damn , flynne , you are one observant tweaker .
figured out what ?
you want some punch ?
that 's his , i do n't know , his 'grounding ' phrase for me , `` together , no matter what . ''
you did n't beat me . you ignored the rule of engagement . in a fair fight , i 'd kill you .
uh , sure . i hear you .
tell me . what do you want ?
ah , that 's good . that 's all that 's important . back to business . back to work . bye now , father .
him ?
i remember the old bastard 's liver ! i do n't believe you did that . i had a great sent- imental attachment to that .
wow ...
how long ?

you want to go talk to him ?
you left a print ! there was kel that did n't go off ! there was a partial print , they tracked it back to treadstone ! they know it 's you !
you got ta good heart .
dad ! i know !
c'mon tony , waddaya say ?
god damn you , sam adams ! you wanted a revolutionary army and now that we 've really got one it scares you more than it does the british !
i love you too , frances .
so you 're going to michigan ?
hello ? no , operator ...
but he still has something mark has n't .
well , what do you think i 'm going to do ? quit in protest ? i 'm not going to do that .
well , she is getting on , but she 's fine . i told her you were n't feeling well yesterday . she called to find out how you are .
aversion ? no ... `` hatred '' ... `` loathing '' ...
i 'm sorry i went off like that , i get passionate . i -- i guess i 'm a passionate person . one of those things i had forgotten . when you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero ?
that 's my problem , belle .
you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own .
excuse me , do you know if we 've passed nostrand avenue yet ? excuse me . look , i 'm asking a simple question . have we hit nostrand avenue ? i fell asleep .
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
i-work-for-a-covert-vatican-humanitarian- organization . the-cia-made-a-fool-of-me . i-care-for-you ...
what mission ?
why should she come in ?
i 'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way .
okay , i 'm going ahead . wait a minute , what 's her name ?
oh , an imaginary one . i used to hike a lot through the woods and i 'd always take this girl with me so i could talk to her . i 'd show her my pet trees and things . sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it .
if it does n't take too long . drink ?
do n't be childish , samuel . of course you want something . you must have hopes , wishes , dreams .
of course ! the power converter ! it works ! of course , it works ... what chemicals do we use ?
will you really hold me to it over < u > pennies < /u > ?
he 's thirty-five years old .
just give me a chance to show how much i love you . love changes everything . love makes everything possib1e .
having a little trouble with that knot , are n't you ?
it 's okay if i sit closer ? so i do n't have to scream . not that i do n't need to scream sometimes , believe me . but i do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to write or something .
... oh god , do n't shoot me ...
no , before my time .
oh , alvy , come on .
it means i care about you and what happens to you .
i guarantee it 'll be worth your while .
just so you do your work .

jeremiah ... what 's gotten into you ?
yes , but i would n't ...
yes , sir , i 'll see if i can reach general hammond in seoul for you . you think he 'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons ?
at least you and kendall agree on that .
it is ?
no !

i hate him .
mark 12 .
he 's gone to check your answers on his computer .
you want zero to kill him ?
this is just the first shot . maestro . sooner or later she 's gon na use the word . and all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that 's the jews .
i still got to talk to heather , dude . weird funeral , huh ?

harry 's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he 'll never get off the ground with a star he 'll never sign . with or without my help .
i am very sorry , sir , i have not seen act two .
yeah , just a minor encounter with the shrew .

that 's it ! that 's the reason !
i never intended to test you two to that extent , but you both came through . i should 've been informed there was a flag on the play , but i 'll take that up with ruiz . i made a few calls back east . those punks were n't tied in with anyone . as for the welshman , he was n't in on it . he was just plain dumb . as for you , ricky , your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van .
and that is ?
hey , what are you doing here ?
cynthia !
what if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it ?
the answer 's yes . i think . yes . i do n't know . where are they exactly ?

i 'm going back inside .
sorry . but after our days ... so if i try this thing ... if i ship out to coronado ... what happens here ?
you need to see the prison shrink , man .
sense/net taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before his death . everything dixie was -- everything dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct . of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sense/net 's .
the negro league do n't pay so good . and you 're always on the road . that do n't wash with daisy .

you did ? why ? where were you ? they said you left hours ago . we were worried .
too bad .
he ai n't wade .
thank you .
i would have preferred staying home , me .

the password is : `` one hand washes the other . '' the minute you hear that , you say `` i fear nothing . ''
that 's all right , eric .
no , no . that 's not the way it is at all . no , i stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend . wait , yeah , no , i was trying to come up with some lie so that you would n't have to go to jail for the rest of your life .

she 's obviously dealt with this guy before .
where you going ?
signal the endeavor to fall back . we 'll cover them .
i 'm serious . you do n't -
i do n't drink coffee , daddy . and this is not what we should be talking about .

it 's the sequel .
`` sleepless in seattle '' ?
yeah . you did good . what 's wrong ?
i only went for my last two years .
i have a friend at the magazine .
why not ? how was the fishin ' ?
you 're tense . what are you all uptight about ?
oh , he 's so kind , so gentle inside , and so unhappy with that rich wife who does n't understand him , her being a southerner and everything , and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts !
for about two seconds .
tell me it 's not true .
... nothing .
i , vigo , the scourge of carpathia --

yes . i had thought that ... i was loathsome to you . perhaps i am . if i may be excused , m'lord .
it 's not < i > exactly < /i > him .
why was n't i notified ?
why do n't you take a rest , brian ?
and do n't you worry about it .
all of these are interviews ?
i had a career . she wanted a little bowler of her own . sid and breeze leap into the fray , prying the two men apart . they wrestle theo against a wall , pressing his face into the tiles .
oh man , you shoulda come with us last night , marty . that one for you was a real lunatic . how 'd you make out ?

runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago . they were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood . of all the runes , thorn had the most negative influence . cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic .
i 'm sitting here , i 'm looking at you and i 'm having these flashes . you know , flashbacks , of memories . of us .
you know about the united nations ?
stoned ?
you first .
no , for a candlelight dinner , yes , for her show .
something ... i 've got ... you do n't .
all you 've got is the here and the now trevor . that 's all anyone really has . maybe this will make things easier to understand . a man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he 's a butterfly . in time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he 's a man . and at the end of the day does it even matter ? all these events you 're describing . how can you be sure any of them really happened ?
i 'm lost , boss . what are we saying here ?
all right then !
i 'll say goodbye to you , tita .
i could n't have done it without you .
what 's the matter ?
no , son , she is dead .

you 're in a lot of trouble , mrs. tasker , so i suggest you cooperate . if we want to know the most intimate details of your life , you 'd better tell us .
i warned you -- i get on a roll ...
out on my back when i was a small boy .
nothing , i 'll call you , okay ?
you 're very direct , mr. felson .
doctor soran ?
all sound reasons for matrimony .
then tell richardson to fire him .
we did it , ray .
okay . if you think it will help .
you lied to me ?
ok .
we were just sorting things out .
nazorine , my friend , tell me what i can do .

you sure ?
i wo n't have to shoot those dogs . they will kill each other .

not unless they 're immortal .
mimi ...

what 's going on ?
come on . what 's with you and michael ?
well , for the past couple of years i 've been goin ' out with girls from my acting class .
i hope so , mr. reynard .
he did .
do you suppose that was our problem ? we met before our time ? i think that happens a lot . people , events , planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place .
i have illegitimate children .
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits ?
no ! they will be the judge of that ! and so will i ... if you shame me !
okay .
i hate to bother you when you 're laid up .
you 've heard of the national security agency ?
is there a mrs. dyle ?
because he was a brave man - because i liked him -- i came here to be sure .
bravo , young man . you have to tell me what this was all about sometime . i want you to know ... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane ... i was fully prepared to have you committed to the < u > finest < /u > mental-health facility available . i mean that sincerely , do n't thank me .
zydowski . it 's about time .
do n't know . think of something .
i think he wants more than your cookies .
no ! let me try this !
i wan na see this ... where is he , do you know ?
this is ridiculous . why is there no elevator ?
oh ... i 'm sure that 's not true . i 'll bet she 's very worried about you . i would be .
i 'm not , but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is .
you know that other key to your apartment -- well , when we had that little scare about miss kubelik , i thought i 'd better get rid of it quick -- so i threw it out the window of the commuter train .
week after week , to thousands of people , you 're as young as you want ...
anything new ?
all right , love ya ma . listen , before ya go just give us the goods , eh ?
nothing ?
you 've only had sex with three different people ?
are you angry with me ?
good . so shall we leave it at that then ?
patrizia , do n't start in again ... i would rather be called depraved . unless you happen to love children .
... did you make that up ?
... i know it 's you , bruce . i 'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it ...
huh . i抎 have thought a tough guy like you would know better . the sick ones are out there , friend . they make up the client鑜e . get rid of them and we抮e out of business .
i -- i -- i -- i -- i -- , j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete .
right . my brother .
hey beni ! looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river !
strange , not doin ' a run-up on the main drive yet . strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape .
except for that .
kim and i are close friends !
now this is where we keep all of out meat . you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers . you got twelve- turkeys , two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb . do you like lamb , doc ?
how about you ? will you be alright ?
all right , who serves ?
i got my own ... < u > quest < /u > to pursue up here . it 's crucial i not get sidetracked , with some silly ...
oh no ... i 'm not good at that . very bad in fact ...
maybe demille is shooting .
which is everyone you could n't get in .
i think that 's a type-o then , that would be a mistake .
this man -- did you see him ?
wha ' ?
good work , flynne . you 're a first-rate rat .
sheriff buddy was a different story . long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day , make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then , if you was polite -- maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then , things was peaceful . that sheriff wade , though , he took an awful big bite .
uh ... yeah , well , you know , ma , john kennedy went by jack .
are you a preacher ?
i 've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years . this man had n't been dead an hour . he was n't killed last night . he was killed today . in broad daylight . that 's no drunk- rolling job .
the only way we 're gon na blow this now , is if we do it ourselves ...
elroy .
you knelt there , helpless- you could n't save him . there was so such anger in you- . death infuriates you ...
well , i just talked with ben tramer and he got real excited when i told him how attracted you were to him .
i am not a doctor .
someone else coming ?
susie ... i ...
who are you - the goddamn bionic woman ? !
i was doin ' both . here .
it was a man 's voice . repeating some sort of children 's rhyme . i do n't know , it did n't make any sense . you did n't hear it ?
no clotting or gathering of pus . no healing at all .
hi .
mr. welles certainly is a caution
we have to start simpler , is that it ?
no . i should have . i told them i disagreed with you , mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original . i 'm not lying for you . i 'm not gon na shut up for you . not on any of it .
hey , i was senior . it 's ok. this is why i get the big bucks .
hi .
why did you have luh come here ?
no , no .
who 's she ?
my god ...
we do n't even know you .
cross was looking for her all over the country . offered rewards , everything . felt real sorry for him , with all his money .
see , i ...
we ought to be suing him .
yes , please continue .
she 's a drag . a well-known drag . we turn the sound down on her and say rude things .
< u > why < /u > ... ? !
did n't this `` information '' come from the joe boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you shu kai kim , a korean , an outsider ?
you may well call it upside down , since you occupy its lowest level . and deservedly . the eastern desert has never been explored -- because we 've always assumed that no life can exist there . save yourself , taylor . tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ?
a statement ? good .
i do n't want any part of crucifying this boy .
you , mr. kay ? how do you know george cukor ?

we always planned to use it . we got some ground up already ... but we could never find enough .
follow close . we 'll cross the next meadow .
we have no choice .
who told you my name ?
that depends . where are we ?
we have to stop meeting like this .
you could have told them !
if you believe it , darling , then i believe . being young can be just as confusing as being old . the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday .
where do you get these questions ?
did n't know you felt that way .
actually , i 'm just about to go out with some friends ...
yeah , i got ya . i do n't see anything inside though .
i see . he does talk loud .
is it true ?
sometimes . but what 's the alternative , not playing ? you remember big toni ? she quit last year , now she 's working at some bookstore . i mean , look at us . they treat us like we 're hollywood stars over here . we just played in the championship game . it does n't get much sweeter than this .
i want to see him .
right .
you working on someone right now ?
certainly , of birds .
such as sitting in a darkened room , watching videos , drinking , smoking dope and wanking . does that answer your question ?
-- domini !
you know , all i ever wanted was to measure up to my father .
she knows who we are .
is that right ?
how 'd you get the tape ? why did n't the cops put it in evidence ?
they call it a new look at an old favourite i copied it from the 'window on the world ' show . the far east meets the mid-west !
mr. follett .
shut the fuck up .
why would you wan na do that ?
get outside and watch her house . if you see anything funny call me .
our pursuit ships have sighted the millennium falcon , my lord . it has entered an asteroid field .

it 'll only get you into trouble .
if you want company ...
simply because he eluded your trap , do you think he is more than a man ? my father is dying . perhaps you should think of our coronation .
that 's too bad . i would rather have him at home -- to see what i 'm going to do .
it was on account of the birthday party .
grrrreat !
sit down and stop being such a child .
saving it for the sunday times .
i have a headache .

mr. sweeney , how goes it ?
what if you and me got into a struggle ... and my gun went off ?

-- i do n't have any anger at you --
thank you , samuel .
what ?
the doctor can tell , but i decided not to know . i want it to be a big surprise .
what do you think ?
i ca n't do it .

scotland . he intends --
because there was another girl ? years ago -- a nice girl . she lived on barrow street . i saw her with you once - ? i saw her with you twice and then i never saw her again . that 's why .

yes i did . did you hear my answer ?
this is a family matter ! if my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! now get me out !
so , your husband ditched you ?
you do n't . he finds you . through his people .
in here ! !
maybe they do梐nd maybe they do n't .
sounds like you got a conflict of interest .
of course he 's not real . you think i 'd be working here if i could afford a real snake ?
lieutenant , i 've triangulated recent bizarre events -- the bronx , jersey , brooklyn -- all rippling out from -- here . the e.s.u . science center . octavius ' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time , drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding , electromagnetism and gravity --
yeah .
technical ... i could n't help you from that angle . you see , a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off .
what ? who the hell are you ?
listen , dammit .
only three shocks . a chimp takes fifteen . this is going to be tres simple , no , gabrielle ?
why not ?
you 're still here ?
you wuss . it 's no problem . one person says something to the other and that 's how it starts ...
how do you know how i 'd act in africa ?
i wo n't play tonight . i could n't . not possibly . i could n't go on ...
forget the bumbling americans , they will be like all the others . without the map to guide them , how can they possibly find hamunaptra ?
i know the feeling . this must be hell . can you believe , a flucking sorority ... i 'm gon na vomit day-glo .
i do n't have a girlfriend --
i 'm gon na assume that was meant as a compliment , anna , and just say thank you .
we are emissaries of her majesty , queen cherlindrea , of the land of coshairm .
getchmis olsun
how can i tell you what i do n't know !
oh , jesus ! you want to be a martyr or a hero or what ?
now , did you remember that , or ...
here he comes .
icarus ?
but not more than your comfort .
hey , man , how 's it going ?
it does n't matter , alright . just leave it alone .
need some help ?
go home !
the tranquilizer tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she ? these women are out here on a lark -- ladies night at a discotheque . it 's not in their blood the way it is for catwoman ... where is she ?
the sign says strawberry finches .
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
i allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with .
maybe you should n't . do n't get happy . this changes nothing between you and me . you did a good thing and mother sister wanted to thank you for it .
what the fuck does that mean ?
bensinger -- of the tribune .
i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy ... .
then he 'll be back at blue balls ?
uh , yeah . cut to the chase .
i 've heard good things about their london branch . you have to admit , it sounds like some fantasy , role-playing nonsense .
your highness , forgive this intrusion , but ...
you and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident were n't you ?
he 's obsessed with his own image . he wants his nobel peace prize a little too much . as the late `` doctor '' king proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press .
the night is young . anyway , it was logical . you know , you 're a great one for logic . i 'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread . we 're both extremists . reality is probably somewhere in between us .
on account of me .
graveyard dead . august this year . a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian , texas . the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died .
uh , yeah , uh ... t-t-this is more like a present for you , yeah , but it's-
this is weir .
as it was in the begin is now and ever shall be , world without end , amen .
that 's right , mr. sheldrake . i wo n't be needing it -- because i 'm all washed up around here .

how many bottles ?
chase ?
for 25. best known for the `` tragedy and blood '' genre , this author-playwright --
here , pauly .
maybe you need a few weeks in bermuda , or something . or go to a whorehouse ! no ?
you mean out of business . heh , heh .
... what ?
no , it 's kissing again . you do n't want to hear it .
that 's not the way it looked to me . looked to me like you was trying to make time with her .
i ... i did n't think you would ... i 'm sorry ... i believed that son-of-a- bitch ...
it 's there .
if you want , do it . i do n't care .
no . but i 'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back .
splendid , mother . let 's hop over to monte carlo . it 's a great place to save a face .
rose ... please ...
sure have , sam .
yes , she was afraid . she said there was someone who wanted to kill me .
you 're just a nice guy , mr. mulvaney . only do n't fuck around with me , you know what i mean ?
when i dressed like you do now , you threw me out of the house . i used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits ... then i went ahead and married one ... i went yuppie and you became a hippie ... were still out of synch .
duh ... that 's quick .
you know , you 're a < u > writer < /u > , that 's your script . you 're a < u > director < /u > ... but if you 're the < u > producer < /u > ... what did you do ? what did you do ? all you 've got is the < u > credit < /u > ... some plaque on the wall ...
murder .
you 'd lie to protect him .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know what else to say except i 'm sorry .
she was n't looking at you , man , she was looking at me .
how would you like to take me to dinner ?
leave me alone , jude .
yeah . look , uncle terrence -
afraid she might commit suicide ? people who commit suicide do n't talk about it . that room made her happy in some strange way i could n't understand . she lived in a world of her own fancy . she did n't always tell the truth . in fact - ? i 'm afraid she did n't know what the truth was . there were many things about jacqueline i did n't understand , and yet , without understanding , i had to be with her 棗 to see her 棗 to touch her 棗 in order to be happy . it 's hard to explain to a youngster .
to join , and become one with the creator ?
we all have paths to follow . you hope yours will lead you to me .
i wo n't be a moment .
if the young woman truly loves raoul --
yeah !
thank you . why do n't you go back to the video store ?
tell the choppers we 're lifting off !
< u > yes < /u > : she is saying this in albanian , < u > but < /u > she 's doing it not to be uh ... but because , she explains , that is the only way it can be understood by her aged and sainted mother , who is standing there with her , dressed in her traditional ...
place is great . really . one great place ... basketball , bowling . you name it . canasta . hearts . lots of guys are making salad bowls . what i 'll do is make a salad bowl for you , unless you 'd rather have a pencil holder . the pencil holder 's neat , i mean --
are you crazy ! ?
from your mouth .
well , the marijuana crop is a good start .
what is it ?
now , the googly looks like a leg break , but it 's really an off break . got it ? like this .
how come you stopped making movies with harry ?
look , i know you guys are telling the truth . it 's just the shi'ites do n't know that . i guess you could tell them ... but then you do n't speak the language do you ?
not much .
then i 'd say it 's bedtime for jason .
wo n't daddy powell take care of us ?
i 'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will . somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where i 'm working and take me out of there .
not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .
waring hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha-ha ! say , buddy ! when is the sidewalk fully dressed ? when it 's 'wearing ' hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha !
does what feel comfortable ?
yes , that 's true .
nervous ?
all right ... but you see our predicament ... legally we ca n't hold him , but he may be able to help us ... perhaps later . for now , he 's free to leave .
just a second !
take the luminal to sleep , or whenever you feel an attack coming on .
what the --
you wan na go on a date with me ?
you ... you knock the code , when you come back , ok ?
that 's gon na take a long time !
six months , i 'm out on probation , but it 's cool now , baby .
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen . i 'm mary wells .
yes .
current evidence seems to be to the contrary , would n't you say ? ! give it to them !
what are you doing on the floor ? it 's my fault . if i 'd had a proper hospital bed , this never would have happened . here , let me help you back in . i know this hurts , but it 'll only take a few seconds . there you go . comfy ?
no ...
the children . where are your children
apparently .
come on , magda it 's like that movie harold and maude .
oh , i 've got to get a shot of this .
they 're makin ' a movie , here , goddamn it .
so what do we do ?
it 's not enough . more ! more , do you hear me ?
stop the hydraulics .
if you 're gon na cheat , you might as well copy off somebody who 's gon na get the answer right .
the shaft is giving .
all right . kawakita , cover the rear .
someday , you may not mind so much .
what ?
i just ... your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin , i wan na bite it ... .i wan na bite your cheek and chew on it ... .god damn cute ... .fuck ... .
... he walked off ...
what did he say ?
they get those weak eyes from reading - you know , all those long columns of tiny figures in the wall street journal .
okay , karen is expecting you in half an hour . you only have to stay with her one night , she 'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there .
i do n't care what he thinks .
look , ted , i do n't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him .
that 's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit .
and where is joseph ?
`` lady bird , lady bird , fly away home , your house is on fire and your children all gone '' ... do you think anyone 's hurt ?
you killed santa claus ?
that 's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches . i do n't go round messing about with your ear-phones , do i ?
no . bring him on deck with the others .
that 's a big pass , elton john .
the cloak invisible . it was my mother 's parting gift .
let my kid go .
between you and me , madam , today the number two .
ever since i can remember , since i was a child .
top drawer . maybe if you did n't call me ma'am , things would work out better .
c'mon , c'mon , let 's hurry this up .
i am beginning to know mr. nehru .
for me ? trevor ! how romantic ! come here , you .
if my mother caught me up here she 'd kill me .
i see ...
he 's cutting funding for nasa . the milk cow of the aerospace industry . we 're talking billions . motive enough ?
i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t.v .
how ?
kimberly , it 's a dance . it 's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that i see every stupid day .
do they know them ?
i say i 've got it .
come warm yourself if you like .
there 's a big black spider in the bathroom .
what do we do with him ?
the land is there . i know it !
yeah man .
yeah . sure .
sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , i am available . i am seventy-four years old , i am not board-certified . i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done .
so this is temporary for you ?
thirty-thousand , that 's all . we would have been free and clear . you did n't have to kill him .
anybody home ?
that 's the longest i ever did it . 'bout bust a gut .
we got a lot to talk about .
it 's gon na be hard for me to get away with the show taking off .
so are you engaged , or what ?
you got a guy , does n't believe the war is ... no no no . an american serviceman ... a brave american serviceman , is left < u > behind < /u > ... he is left behind . he is discarded like an old shoe ... gemme the pentagon . list of people in all military special programs ... . left behind . like the old shoe ... johnny : `` good old shoe '' ...
do n't you want to come along , darling ?
do n't know . looked for him for a bit ... could n't find him .
any messages , carmen ?
on what basis would they reject him ?
how soon will you be able to decode it ?
no . the ... uh ... the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens . but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull . assaultus interruptus .
i guess i ... if i jumped to ...
no .
um , i 'm jerry ... that 's bill ... denise and mary .
you 're not going into surgery tomorrow are you ?
do n't talk . these caves magnify sound . just follow me .
okay , i 'm thinking .
accident .
sean feels he has n't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground .
well -- did you get it , thorwald ?
i hope so . at least i got to see you and grandma . has it ever worked before ?
it does hurt ! and do n't you do it again .
howdy .
hurry -- hurry --
you know , you --
i 'm glad of it . i 'd rather please you than anybody i know of . oh , darlin ' , will you give me something ?
buy a new one ! in a new town ! where you wo n't have to hide your mother !
minors are n't allowed at fights .
you know he 's fucking us .
how to put it ... ah , of course , mary clarence . `` no pain , no gain . ''
i only use it for medicinal purposes . do n't be a pring ...
the center for disease control . if this thing is contagious --
of course we are brothers . why do you say that ? you hurt me , george .
but why ? she 's been ill -- erratic , but i 've never heard of anything like that !
it 's a terrible shock , eh ? what time did signor miles leave yesterday ?
i go running down there .
thought he might be coolin ' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us . so i left the bottle out as bait .
she sure is . she 's letting me stay here while she 's working on a movie that 's being made in canada , but i guess you know that . i could n't afford a place like this in a million years . unless of course i 'm discovered and become a movie star . of course , i 'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star , but sometimes people end up being both and that is , i guess you 'd say , sort of why i came here . i 'm sorry , i 'm just so excited to be here..i mean i just came here from iowa and now i 'm in this dream place . you can imagine how i feel .
nothing .
if you 'd seen that police station you would n't even ask .
what ?
wait for what ?
pardon ?
have tom hagen meet me in the harbor house .
you try to be nice to people , when they 're rude about your singing ...
snowplow , generator , tv dish ... hell , we get the goddamn playboy channel ! here , this is for you .
you 're not worried that someone might take him ?
i 'm going to take a look at this .
she lived alone .
i do n't know . something to do with the four-packs ... ... they 're not bad .
you can try , but you wo n't get too far . why you interested ?
easy now , miss , i 've got you ? ? ?
no , these are the tapes from the living room . check this out .

elliot .

any parting words of wisdom ?
you 're alan grant , are n't you ? i read both of your books .
oh ?
where to ?
you switched license plates ?
i figured something like that ...
entertaining .
you guys , you guys , you 're all the same . the doctors at the hospital , you ... it 's 'what i 'm going to do for you ' ; but you screw up it 's 'we did the best that we could . i 'm dreadfully sorry ... ' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives .
i 'm sure we 'll get him on this next sweep .
all right , who ate the last piece of cheesecake ?
if the pig had n't broke his leg , we could have taken him .
they got a whole system they call 'dream skills ' . so , if you have a nightmare , for instance like falling , right ?
your what ?
but scott , who 's going to take over the world when i die ?
thank you .

oh , thomas ! she has cut my strings ! i am unmanned , unmended , and unmade , like a puppet in a box .
... the door ! open the door ! open the door ! open the door ! open the door !
you 're perplexing to me these days , wendell . you 're not your old , cruel self anymore . i need proof that the extracurricular work i had planned for you remains within your grasp .
i mean , he took care of himself only too well . and that 's why every badge back home wanted to nail him .
william munny , yeah .
paul , will you sign my yearbook ?
yeah .
what 's wrong with just being gale weathers ? i liked her !
bye .
what ?
i do n't think it was really decided , director .
life is only life when it is bounded by death . the inheritance is death . the gift is the finality of life . to be part of the fabric . the inside . i love you brenna .
i could n't go near that woman .
you 're nosey , you know that , argyle ?
and let 's also not forget -- let 's not forget , dude -- that keeping wildlife , an amphibious rodent , for uh , domestic , you know , within the city -- that is n't legal either .
cynthia ... that would not be a good idea .
yeah , i 'm doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i do n't even know where to begin .
i 'm sorry . we do n't .
and it 's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it .
i mean i 've been with a lot of girls i know .
unbelievable .
look . i did n't know when we were going to be on until yesterday . what was i supposed to do ? i had the pianos anyway .
on my way ... !
take a look at this .
we 've subpoenaed the auction house 's records .
i 'll be right back with mrs. wheeler .
well , just as i thought . surely it 's all been a terrible mistake . this parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics !
see you next weekend , dad .
two .
come on .
i came home early and found your note . i guess you meant for me to read it later . elaine , i 've got to talk to you .
i think i understand what you have in mind ...
that 's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people would n't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation ...
what for paul .
how long you been working for me , auggie ?
i 'm buying .
mattress police . there are no tags on the mattress . i 'm going to have to take you downtown . please give me your weapon .
i do n't look like no possum !
everyone out of the rigging now !
who is this ... ?
you stole from them , you lied to me . how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ?
well ... i ... i thought ...
this is like nursery school .

i thought they were n't meeting him at the airport ...
i 'm on my way to get a haircut .
lucky man .
yes , sir .
what do you mean , general ?
well , i did n't mean it , alan . why the fuck would i want to save a homeless shelter ?
what are you thinking , momma ?
would you ... maybe call round sometime ? try to make friends .
yes . and i also want to leave this city .
washington !
why would you be there ?
hey , guess who 's here ? it 's that chick from inside story ?
no problem , mr. ullman . i was just getting to the ice cream .
what car ?
it was at least as good as the sky .
last month .
cut it out . just cut it out , okay ? it 's starting to get on my nerves .
you surprise me . eliminating a rival like that . such are the actions of a man of conquest . i was mistaken . 300 years have turned the boy 's fear into ambit- ion .
it 's always john .
it was j.d . 's idea ! he made out the signature sheet and everything . now will you sign it ?
she 's gone .
i do n't think so . alex 's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it .
there 's the fence ...
turn this way . no , no ... not you ... you !
did she hurt herself ?
maybe twenty gallons an hour .
who is it ?
oh , damn ! that 's it .
you should n't have taken the money ...
do n't accept any more .
uh huh . you got mailed to the wrong address .
the goddess who comprehends all goddesses , eye of ra , protector , avenger , and destroyer , giver of life , who lives forever ... i could keep going .
oh ?
we got exactly two choices , maranzano or masseria .
hey joey , whadda ya lookin ' to die young ?
exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or have n't you checked a map lately ? !
lieutenant ...
this is noble , sir . his wife is crippled . his children are on the brink of starvation .
not really . it 's pretty boring .
... givem what they want ... but ...
hold on , hold on , we all know bob is an important part of the gang .
wally . this is danny witwer . he 's from justice and we 're to give him a full run of the farm .
maybe she is .
about two-thirty .
jesus
that one 's probably married . think of his kids . his wife 's pregnant ...
not exactly , just feel like somebody 's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years .
it 's a beautiful town , prague . it 's been good to me .
sorry , megan . not this time .
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation .
i got one up on ya .
yeah -- fine . excuse me . i 'll be right back .
waal , i got ta tell you . i 've been inside the beltway fourteen years , and i feel like i just got my feet wet .
well , i was goin ' to , but bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first , which i can understand , but then it went an ' took so long , i ran flat outa money ... i did n't have no number to call , you know . so i hadda clear outa there an ' come on up here , in the hopes that i would n't be intrudin ' myself ...
reverend edwards .
all right already . i 'll take it off . kind of warm in here anyway .
i do n't trust you !
do n't say that . you know it 's not true .
you 'll total the whole car .
i drink . a couple of occasions more than i should have . i was cited for shoplifting once . but it was a mistake ... i pushed liane one time . we were both stressed out because of the pressure . she went to her mother 's . i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself . and i do n't like to be pushed around !
about what ?
he wo n't listen to anybody . he 's been very crazy all summer . since june he 's been trying to kill me .
hold on .
does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school !
mrs. d ! i was hoping you 'd show up .
she was never attacked . i think she made it all up .
what did he bring him in for ?
only every time i 'm in here .
dr. lunacharsky ... ?
sir , you 're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior .
throw that away .
claire ?
he lives in a judicial compound . he travels by motorcade . he has better protection than george bush . even more importantly he is part of la hermanidad . his reach is far and wide .
travis , what single thing would you want the next president of this country to do most ?
what the fuck ? i just asked you for a job yesterday !
mr. sulu , lock phasers on target and await my command ...
i 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody , i ca n't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you . you 're driving me up the wall , lester . you 're even jealous of the dogs . i mean i 've got ta have somebody i can talk to .
of course i do .
yes , i 'm sure she 's fine .
you 'll get it . now what 's the story ? i 'll have the paper send the money right down to you . i swear it on my mother 's grave .

i though freddy was just an old town story .
i 'm tired , diego . go to bed .
it 's not really my place , but it 's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . see , i know a little about missing persons . when kids run , they almost always leave a note . it 's guilt . they want to say goodbye .

i 'm going to state now . things are going okay . i guess . mom 's good ...
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier , and is famous as a man of fashion in london . it is mighty well of you to fight farmers ' boys , but to fight an englishman is a very different matter .
she 's a nun , vince .
fantastic lady . do n't know what i 'd do without her .
he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you did n't see him die .

the playwright does n't make the performance - and it does n't just happen ! and this one did n't - full of fire and music and whatnot , it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt , over and over , full of those bill sampson touches !
a lot of what larry says is true . they just clone stuff , or reverse engineer it , and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
jesus doug , they 'll execute us !
i got tired of being played with .
right . but , that 's not the biggest problem . one of our intel officers picked up information from dea that traffickers have come up with a process , a chemical process , to turn coke into something else . it does n't smell like coke . it does n't look like coke . and what 's worse , it does n't react to field test . it could be anything . maybe it 's already happening . i mean , how would we know ?
robard 's my client . i did it for him and his club , not your boys .

i did n't mean with you in it .
i thought you were an editor , not a reporter ?
i need her exact name , you see .

all i can find out about the williams ' is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams , a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts , has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is oswald , a defector , doing visiting his wife in his house ? williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger , another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program . he used slave labor to build the v-2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him .

it 's all in your own mind , father ... it 's you who imagine that i 'm always up here with some man or other ... .
no .
... you see , i can watch things up here , doolittle . i love to watch things , just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids , gas clusters ...
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things .
paul , since you brought her up , i have to ask you this , or i 'd be drummed out of the agents ' union -- what about a non-fiction book ? the truth about what went on in that house .
i 've always said the one reason i 'm the best detective in the industry is that i 'm the only one ... but hey , i never throw away a clue ...

congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army !
it 's passing over earth as we speak ! trajectory coordinates are 009843 .

the funny thing is , i started to believe he really was my dad .
i 'll see you in a minute .
frank ... frank sullivan .
not ever . never .
i want to tell you something , doc , but before i do , i need to ask you a question ... because , for me to tell you this thing -- well , i have n't told anybody about this . it 's the biggest secret i 've got .
it means a lot ... that you came .
headache , huh ? too much sun , i guess . you want to come in ? still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it .
how 'd you get this number ?
what 's old got to do with it ?
put it to you this way -- you 're gon na have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula , mister .
i 'm o.k . i 'm o.k .
yes ? who is there ?
yes , sir .
i ca n't ...
dressed for what ?
this is damned peculiar . yellow alert .
it 's more than that .
i understand .
he 's not saying that ! he 's saying do n't volunteer !
well , that 's a hot one . you a bookkeeper ! when were you ever a bookkeeper ?
no more witnesses . west 's a ghost . but it does n't matter because we have your signature , the hospital log , and kendall 's toxicology report . and that 'll be enough .
yes .
yes , i know . but he was always hanging around the house .
he saw an owl .
simple simon on the rock , go caller .
his name is robert paulson !
-and babcock , i remember . now go on !

this is about the `` wanted ! '' posters , is n't it .
no ... do n't hit me please ...
it could . yes .
forty-two-hundred , i figure .
how 'bout granma ?
and who accused him ? diamond louis ! one of the worst crooks in town ! why do n't you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames ?
if you say so . it could be anything .
it 's a hitchhiker .
not yet . the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address . i抣l give it 24 hours . he just might show up . if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont . paul lamont , all right ?
i think we should try sneaking in .
it 's true ... what you said ...
can we maybe ask for more money on this ?
what about mitch ? did n't he have anything to say about this ?
yes . but i sense the element of revenge here .
if anybody had told me i 'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet .
fatigued , certainly . but dead is a little extreme . on the other hand , when me dear gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live .
no . we neutralized enemies of the united states . anti-american radicals who have killed federal officers out here !
it 's too loud for me .
but surely , professor , you do n't intend we disregard the more ... philosophical works .
mmm , it tastes so good . mr. deeds , i do n't know how i can ever thank you .
wait a minute , you 're not the guy , are you ? the dry cleaner ?
he 's probably going up to the pet sematary . kids 've been going out there on halloween night for years .
fine . but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life .
< u > nothing 's < /u > real . i 'm rich , people are automatically my friends , sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and --
mushroom puffs aren抰 the only thing i do well ...
is this really the time ?
sir , i was wondering ...
what 're you talking about ? you 're a real likeable person . you 'll make friends out there in portchester one , two , three . you 'll have people visiting you alla time . i 'll come visit you . i 'll borrow my brother freddie 's car , or you can call me up when you feel blue , or i 'll call you up . and it 's gon na be nice . do n't be so afraid .
well , nothing we can do about it . come into my house . you can stay with me , until i build you your own place . i expect you wo n't want to mix with the others -- not our type of people .
yes , i suppose so .
you bet it wo n't . i 'll arrange for you to get a month 's severance pay -- that 's right , miss olsen . i 'm letting you go .

... it 's an old story . i grew up in south boston , more or less on the streets . by the time i was thirteen i 'd tried my first hit of heroin , by fifteen i 'd stopped using but i was dealing full-time . by the time i was nineteen i decided i did n't want to live any more , at least not in a world like that . one day i got on a bus ; i got as far as ohio before my money ran out , and after that i just kept walking . did n't eat , did n't sleep ... just walked . i ended up collapsing in a wheat field . there was a storm ... i woke up ... and that 's about as far as words 'll go .
yeah , how did you know ?
i 'm just fine , ally . what about you ?
mr. jung , do n't you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case ?

well , that definitely looks like marshmallow to me .
yes , sir . i suppose you might call it that , sir .
i want you to .

most prudent . engine room . report , scotty .
you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less ?
the guy is super cool ! his name is mark and he 's into old horror movies and he plays guitar . i actually hung out with him today .
it 's not a date . it 's co-workers going to a professional conclave .
i did n't see nothin ' planted .
not one word . he admits to having sex with your mother but that 's all .
when the enterprise-b beamed us off the lakul , we were partially in the nexus . the transporters locked on to us , but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind .
i hated you for so long , michael ; for so many years . i think i did things to myself , to hurt myself , so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too . but i understand you now ; i think i do . you were being strong for all of us , like papa was . and i forgive you , and want to be close to you now . ca n't you forgive fredo ; he 's so sweet , and helpless without you .

helen -- the killer directly contacted you . his interest in you is < u > intense < /u > . i 'm worried about you . i do n't want to lose you . i know this stirs up every monster under the bed , but this is the only direct contact we have with him . the only chance we have to trap him . so , you can turn internet back on , or i do , and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick , scream and hyperventilate .
besides , i - i do n't feel like making that trip alone , bob .

and you 'll never leave me ?
yes , sir .

this is the mortgage . this is cindy 's college money .
the usual , 9:15 .

we 've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . while the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there 's nothing fake about truman himself . no scripts , no cue cards . it 's not always shakespeare but it 's genuine . that 's how he can support an entire channel .
sometimes they do somethin ' to you , tommy . they hurt you -- and you get mad -- and then you get mean -- and they hurt you again -- and you get meaner , and meaner -- till you ai n't no boy or no man any more , but just a walkin ' chunk a mean-mad . did they hurt you like that , tommy ?

that 'll make five in a row . never seen it so hot . sometimes i do n't even want to get out of bed . i 'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze . i was in mexico this one time --
what are you doing here ?
are your parents currently citizens ?

mm-hmm ... that 's not what the bartender told us .
oh cards , maybe . poker ... it 's getting cold , sal . i 'm going to take you in . we 'll call angela . the guys can help her bring you home ... did i tell you i was going on a trip ?
how many men you killed ? ai n't you gon na answer ?
i do n't know , one place 's as good as another .
where are you going ?
i spent three years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . george was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . lester does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ?
i really do n't mean to be discourteous . but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england ?
it 's a new experience for me .
you like them , do n't you , boss .

oh no , no , it 's ... it 's wonderful . it 's ... no , do n't worry about it . you 're very funny . go back , that 's great !
and i would n't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful . at a tactic that insults their intelligence .
do n't get upset .
well , he better learn to own it . actions have consequences . it 's not what happens here alice , it 's what they take away with them .
i . . . ca n't . . . argue . . .
she 's not . she 's got her own ideas .
is it japanese ?
not possible , i 'm afraid . the last ferry left hours ago . and we got a storm coming . there wo n't be another one for days .
i will hear you ... but not now , not here .
i 've seen nobleman swords that were n't as well preserved . it 's just a hunk of peasant iron . why would he be carrying it around in an alley ?
what should they be looking for ?
i 'm giving you a chance here : talk to me . you can influence how this thing unfolds .
do n't you understand , george ? it 's because you were not born .
let 's wait for some slow one .
`` big brother '' , `` little brother '' ?
i 'll rig up something do n't worry - do you think i could bash through with that little hammer ?

if we could relay the sunlight-
in a manner of speaking .
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . i kiss you all starryeyed , my body 's swinging from side to side . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
i wo n't even discuss it .
just checking up on your family . i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress ... well ...
find out .
no jokes about my name ? oh , you would n't do that ; you 're trying to be nice .
last time anybody saw this woman she was alive . you seem to certain she 's dead .
yes .
where 's the cabin ?
i do n't believe it , jean ? they 're picking straws .
big feet -- large shoes .
soft . i 'll take the junkie otter , clearly ! i 'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants ... okay . would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller --
well that must 've been mistaken information we got . thanks for straightening it out for us . there is one other matter that 's come up , dave . we were told you took a trip to texas shortly after the assassination of friday .
shut off the moaning , or we 'll have the dogs on us . shut it off , lieutenant . this is orders !
we 're handling it , sir .
relax .
it was here . at his car . i was coming back from a job and spotted you together . you seemed caught . i waved . you giggled .

ruby mcnutt . my one true love .
how do you know ?
`` closed , closed , closed . '' but with your music .
does that bother you , bill ? i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute , she has to have bad eyesight .
rochester ? well , why rochester ?
what makes you think he 'll do it ?
ca n't we go into this later , sweetheart ?
very well . if you insist on details . i have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb . good day , sir . you will forgive me for receiving you like this ?
your family history is very important to you , is n't it ?
it 's not fair ! !
who ?
oh dear , why is life so complicated ? sometimes i really wish i could be someone else .
you are defending him because you 've become infatuated with him .
yes sir . it turns out we put an innocent man into the `` park '' and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine . that is also about the time when bruce began refusing .
now this is war .
shoot .
in a minute . when i get it together .
do n't you think i 'm pretty ?
... we can make it .
figures ...
i do n't trust this man . and i did n't like what he did with your opera . it was common .
just do what i tell you .
you 're not sore at me ?
exactly ! a pirate !
you know her ?
evan , stop ! you 're gon na kill him !
sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps .
that 's right . we had a party here this afternoon for cathy . her birthday .
you 're out of time , man .
that 's not gon na happen . i 'm gon na create reasonable doubt . buckle your seatbelt and watch me work .
we ca n't ... we keep our money there !
he was hot , was n't he ?
yes .
i 'm a very patient man .
he always makes money for his partners . one by one , our old friends are gone . death , natural or not , prison , deported . our friend in miami is the only one left , because he always made money for his partners .
doctor heller ?
what are you going to do ?
i 'm so sorry ... i ... i could n't help it . you know i did n't mean to ... to do any of that .
she 's crazy . you should have killed her .
what do you want to know ?
so ai n't this just the bee 's knees ? the high muckey-mucks dolled up all aztec-like for the human sacrifice .
what do you drink ?
i mean that as a compliment .
please ! it 'll only take a minute . you can have some hors d'oeuvres , and meet my backers ! there 's a really nice dentist from oxnard ...
you do n't understand . the thirst --
long time ago .
i do n't know . next time i 'll have to check .
intriguing ?
why 'd you have to say fifty ? why not thirty-five or thirty-nine ?
no ... no problem .
kate抯 on two , jack . nice ride ...
no . empress , you --
... here on earth to create havoc and terror . i am war , i am death . i am destruction . david berkowitz , 1977 .
that 's some accident , hombre . you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard .
the bed 's all made up if you want to stay .
it said , `` dear mr. brenner , i think you need those lovebirds , after all . they may help your personality . '' that 's what it said .
forget the trapping ! just blast him !
death , i 'm trying to make things right . take my soul . turn me into a paper doll . but give me just one lousy hour .
but what ? is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ?
my orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there .
oh , i do n't have no plans . no plans at all .
do you know how much killer gets for movie rights ?
you do n't have a choice ?
i 'm tellin ' you it was n't no woman , roy !
yes . the five men . they were , of course , your husband , charles , the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday , and carson dyle . but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact . it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money .
right .
yeah . even after that . you did n't take it out on me , except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now . but i 'd say you 've been very fair . i just think it 's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple .
virgil ?
you 're a wonderful woman , darlin ' . as long as you 're around , i 'm sure the sun would n't dare go out .
no .
stewart , would you mind telling me why you 're not going ?
i wo n't feel satisfied unless i got out there , sam .
neither your stomach or your opinion matters here dorsett ... what matters is that mr. trafficante and the bureau have come up with a solution to our panther problem . one might say ... the final solution .
come on , sweetheart ... .
i hope this boy ryan is worth it .
maybe , but i do n't think so . i think it 's just a tease .
what is he doing in here ?
i do n't look too foolish ?
i did ? i did n't see anything .
do n't blame yourself , i did n't have to come along .
who ?
you like to make the boundaries disappear . it 's not only the money , is it , george ? the adventure is part of the victory . it 's the thrill , ah ?
it 's hard to see any change . but i 'm going to stay . another year , anyway .
i was n't disbarred , they dropped the pro ...
there must be some reason why you wo n't let me have them .
a lovestruck page !
yeah ?
in the hills above sunset . just below the getty .
you 're the only woman he ever took out .
this here is the younger gang !
so why 'd you give up ball ?
you . mouth closed .
coming about ... .
i 'm in charge .
you know , clean the pipes .
how are we going to get out there ?
i thought you knew ... she was put on over a week ago-
cannon fuse .
i suppose .
who was talking about what ?
i thought you were out of cigarettes .
yeah . cheers , mate .
yes , i , yes , i signed it , yes . but i , i did n't write that figure .
where are you going ? to him ? is that it ? to be a whore to that gutter rat ?
well , i think it 's charming , rose . but do n't you think ... ah , the skirt is a little tight ?
what are you talking about ?
you look like you were a very sensitive child . you have expressive eyes .
ahmar is ossirion . `` passageway to the underworld '' , actually .
i know how deep her pockets are , ken . i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan . guess who 's on the board of directors at the bank ?
i do n't know . where ?
you catch dylan ?
who the hell was your father ?
... i only ...
do you know ... 34 c ? 32 c ?
'that right ?
everything 's on the fucking run ! everything --
ah-h , if you happen to run into rose sometime ... do me a favor , give her a message for me , will you ?
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb . he died three weeks ago .
all right , fire-and-evade maneuvers . drop everything but weapons and the prc radio -- we 're gon na be high speed , low drag all the way to the link-up site . ready ?
tried to . ca n't quite make the connection with that sucker , though . if i had a direct terminal ...
it made me ill. you could get fired for things like that .
that 's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet .
i have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say , i believe everything , a little .
she needed a job , malcolm . and she 's smart . and she helps me .
i do n't have to but i find it natural .
gentlemen ! gentlemen !
charles , there 's someone else coming along too .
what do you want ?
hey -- you called me ... i ...
your father 's dead . do n't ever forget who 's taking care of you , giving you food , giving you shelter , and giving you the allowance in the first place . if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here , you wo n't last very long . i do n't want another word . finish your dinner , then finish cleaning those 'droids . '
you 're crazy .
that 's not why we 're going out .
you all take care of yourself , too , homer !
i 'll be very glad to show you around , miss ...
would you like a sandwich ?
what 's abba ?
... headquarters .
we should leave the past alone .
woogie , please , you 're starting to scare me .
what about the tape ?
but overall , you 're pleased ?
what are you suggesting ?
what was that ? ?
you hear me complaining about that ?
probably .
are n't these < u > illegal < /u > ?
wyatt ...
the failures they remember . it 's the successes they forget .
hey , kip ...
miss swann ! we 're here to rescue you ! it 's going badly !
do you like dogs , mr. creasy ?
what 's the matter , you do n't know this trick ?
it 's not so bad . i know the night janitor . and there 's a broken locker i can put my stuff .
take it easy , pop .
your mother was n't one to get chased off her patch . half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein ' it through .
really , lula , this ai n't right !
what 's it called ?

i 'll call tomorrow .

it was god 's will .
i do n't think i remember him .
what do they do in the white churches , mama ?
i do n't see anything .
she 's gone , gone to town . she hated working on the farm ... ... just like you .
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers .
and where the hell is marvosa ?
sorry friend , i had no choice . they arrived right before you did .
you know this road got a bad reputation , eladio --
oh , your grace - i thank your grace ! i thank you !

you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --
if that 's a problem , then i 'll make arrangements to stay with some friends .
is it this aisle or the next one over ?
weak sister . i still ca n't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out . y'know ?
i was just wondering if you happen to know anything about paul sheldon .
your relatives must 've taught you something .
the war ai n't over til i < u > say < /u > it 's over . this is < u > my < /u > picture . you think you 're in a < u > spot < /u > ? you think this is a tight spot ? try making the hunchback of notre dame when your three lead actors < u > die < /u > , two weeks from the end of principal photography . this is ... this is ... this is just ... act one : the war . act < u > two < /u > ... the ... uh ...

she got used to the idea . spot lived another four years . he died peacefully in the night that second time , and i buried him in the pet sematary ... where his bones still lie .

tina wilcox .
no way . no , i definitely do n't want to know .
can we talk about this later ?
you 're saying that christ is the child , and --
i was stoned . that 's why they stopped me . when i 'm not stoned , i got no place else to go . they just protect me from myself .
is that why the assembly was convened ?
your friends .

i like the way you talk .

you heard right .
i 'm going ... i 'm going .
only there 's no business like it , no business i know .
yes , she 's , she 's very warm , but , but it-it 's me that wants to be giving to you . i-i-i want to do things for you . hannah does n't need me as much . i 'm being presumptuous . not that you need me .
it does n't matter . i do n't want to stir up any more trouble . i 've been doing it all my life . i 've been such a burden to you梞ade your life so miserable梐nd mine , too . i 'm tired , dad . tired of running around in circles . he 's right , that 's what i 've been doing ever since i can remember .

dad , please ...
mmm-hmm . listen , i forgive you , mr. mccord ...
she 'll be back ...
you 're in show business .
okay , so here 's what i 'll do . i 'll go on up to ted and rita daniels -- two of the nicest people you 'd ever hope to meet , who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- i 'll tell them we ca n't help them cause you do n't feel like working that hard .
is n't that what we want ? germany all over again ? only done right this time ...
i know where he 's coming from . the only thing i really do n't get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
yes .
collected shoes too ?
-- you can and you will , mr. carter .
i do n't mind so much .
wait , this is n't fair ...
but that was the fourth straight time .
she wants to give you your money . if she did n't , there 'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now .
did you buy some clothes ?
will , what happened at the tri-tech meeting ?
why do n't you call norman and let him say just what happened , if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off ... it 'll make the girl feel better , albert .
oh , god ... it must have been bourne .
yeah ... do you mind if i sit ?
did you find it boring ?
now we had a deal here ! a deal 's a deal !
a little basic , but nice .
you 're leading again .
i do n't mean it in that sense . i only give credit where credit is due . er , mr. chang , i 'm very anxious to have you realize that i never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story .
certainly .
we did it .
really , marietta , you got more scenarios swimmin ' around in your brain than carter got pills . try to take it easy . go over to myrtle beach for a few days .
we ai n't ate nothin ' since yestidday .
his home .
quite a few .
neil , you 're not gon na ...
i told you . these murders are not normal .
i do n't know ...
hammer , the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands .
you wo n't even tell me your name . what 's shocking about a name ?
sixpence .
is it that obvious ?
the simplest thing in the world : i want to have a lot of babies with you . dear heart , i love you .
i was sitting there .
do n't say my name ...
and they grow out of our stomachs ?
i made the cut the line gesture . you nodded okay . '
dispersive armor is holding .
i 'm listening .
yeah . what is it ?
later .
what do you mean ? some noises where ?
why are you doing this to me ? ? do you get pleasure from hurting me ?
clearly , i am here , but only as an individual , i 'm not the attorney of record . mr. rafferty has that position . whatever you want , you 'll have to get from him , i have nothing more to say .
well , ben ... i ...
any untoward `` revelation '' regarding , uh ...
timex ...
thanks .
now i 'll bet it has his home address there , too
-- no , you 're not . you love me too much . you do n't want to see them kill me .
fact is you 're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- great deal . you get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing- so what do you really want ? you wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic ? or do you want a guy ?
any girl ? okay . let 's start with that one .
thank you so much for accompanying me .
no .
we have no time for that .
oh , right . dwayne . you 're engaged to dwayne ?
go ahead . sing your ass off .
oh , harold . you make me feel like a schoolgirl .
i 've had it . no more wirehead shit in my car . you understand ? you want to poach your lobes , do it somewhere else .
hi !
where 's the other half ?
then you 'll die .
i mean until we start to burn up .
it 's over .
you 're not going anywhere . you 're gon na get that remote and you 're gon na come home and we 're gon na make everybody happy again ! ! !
it 's so damn quiet out there .
well , you do n't wan na trust me too much . we 'll take ned his share together so you do n't figure i run off with it .
i 'm frightened , sir . really ! when he speaks , he does n't make any sense . you know he said he saw - he said he saw his father . and his father 's dead .
why ?
most people do n't have my kind of problems .
you can call me sister .
i think you falsely identified him . yes .
sure .
would you , doctor ? that would be so kind .
you 're being narrow-minded .
in case you get back before i do .
ram asked me out , but he wants to double with kurt and kurt does n't have a date .
now you know why you抮e here , mr lombard . it might be difficult for someone like you to discern , but we are people of a certain standing .
i went to the bank to see why . they said you emptied our accounts --
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes . scotland is in chaos . your husband is secretly sending an army north .
colonel kurtz , he 's dead .
some of it . right here . i got some of it . i 'll get the rest as soon as i can .
why is he acting so strangely ?
then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl . reed just gave us fifty grand .
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo ?
we 've got too many wounded for us to handle now ! get on the phone right away and ...
bobby , i love jessica like she 's my own daughter . i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter , but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant . your silverback horseshit 's gon na cost me eight grand .
i 'm on my way , starck .
i 'm going in after him .
alex , are you ... .
wussup .
jim -- the boy 's talking to that state -- the story is out -- !
what do you mean ?
franz , trust me . i promise i wo n't let you down .
we can use the crawlspace to get downstairs . then we can run for it .
oh yeah ? you 're a smart man ? ...
why , mr. jason . most of these books are on the closed shelf . you have to get permission .
i suppose you think this is very funny , harold .
... janitor 's job .
i 'm sorry but there 's no record of a jacob singer in our files .
fuck you , too --
get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . harry ?
not yet .
yes !
i 'm not leaving without those stones .
i do n't think i can go on , sir .
i 'm gon na nail it .
you look so ... i do n't know , you look like you 've really been in it .
was he a good detective ?
i 'm trembling with excitement .
who 'd pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they 're busy covering their asses . they 're not the type of people we need . ''
the argies .
i want to die .
what ?
now , it was an accident ! guys , c'mon now , you ... you got ta believe me
dammit , all they have is shows about water .
damn it , norman . i swear . i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up .
well , you call him , and call me back , but this is it , pal , you < u > fuck < /u > with me , and i 'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your < u > chest < /u > . and the best to marion ... where have < u > you < /u > been ?
i know that among you , you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city . get that money over here and i 'll stop this run within five minutes .
no , sir . i mean i did n't think you had n't given it a lot of thought .
that 's why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place .
a do-you-think-he-saurus rex .
they 'll know who i am .
i am not sure what 's more worrying , the job or your past .
i screwed up twice , sir .
i have something .
we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it 's gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there is n't a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .
ai n't there yet .
off the record , i do n't mind telling you , this thing scares the shit out of me .
okay . move on .
oh , yes ! every day . but i do n't need a defense anymore . i embrace ! still fighting for the big issues but now in my small , individual way . shall we have a song ?
absolutely . well , that might be kind of tough . once the press starts smelling blood ...
doctor , always try to do the right thing .
who ?
here . i 'll turn down the air conditioner .
so what should i do with the pudding ?
all right -- bring me a side order of mrs. wheeler . oh , hell -- sit down , colonel . penelope will bring you some chow .
good evening .
five million apiece . you get on your plane , i get on mine .
so ?
i lied .
i say we check it out . you never know .
oh good , you 're here . spengler and i have something really amazing to show you .
so how was school today ?
tis not the time to speak of cheer .
the city ? new york city ? why ?
he 's doped to the < u > gills < /u > ...
fine , do n't ask me out on a date .
it 's not mine .
your father ?
because i remind you of her ?
i 'm a fugitive from the law . i ca n't be seen on the fucking streets . now watch my lips . kempton park . two-thirty . five pounds to win . bad boy .
and me too , son ! you shore done got to be such a big little man !
but maybe you know someone who does . an austrian , in london , dealing in kids and snuff videos . how many can there be ? these people supply to order . he has to be known , reachable .
hey .
i should n't have left her .
i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this .
you could go and open the door .
i 'm making < u > you < /u > nervous . i 'm the one with a schedule .
he kept saying he was protected .
you wan na bet he 's with a girl ?
why not ?
emerald city ? why , that 's a long and dangerous journey . and it might rain on the way .
shut up . you need help , do n't you ?
he 's a good student .
come on , you dumb son of a bitch . i 've got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us .
all right , motherfucker , that 's it .
are n't you eating ?
i told you , he is n't here .
-- flesh is weak .
what you look at , indy ?
we 're not certain ...
alright .
well , it 's one way to get her down stairs .
it 's all right , chet .
maybe . but tonight is probably not the best night . come on , we 're rollin ' .
that was kind of a rotten thing to do , anne . after all , gallagher is my friend . the least you can do is be courteous to her .
and ?
raise the inner jib ! raise the forestaysail !
advance team , two men , stick to that goddamn cab , stay in radio contact , the rest of us follow in the van . nobody moves until the entire team 's in place ...
jack !
no .
oh ... i 'll think of something .
it 's utterly beautiful . i wish i could be creative .
[ pointedly ] of course you 're not .
charming .
you 're pretty black to be growing up in rossmore park .
let me take you out tomorrow night ... pleeease .
look at the treads on those .
man , it 's not like i do n't know about women . i had this babysitter ...
you hardly knew her !
i wo n't let you do that . i shot the bastard . and i 'm glad .
sure .
sorry , mistress .
but not right next to each other . i thought that 's what you meant .
yeah .
hell yeah . that bitch was bleeding . when i first put it in she screamed real loud . i saw her bite down on the pillow .
who would n't ?
i 'm just not the type . besides , i want to get out of here .
do n't you ever get tired ?
today is march second , 2063. the time in montana is oh-eight-forty- five .
you 're done worse .
at that point it became every man for himself . as far as mr. blonde or mr. blue are concerned , i ai n't got the foggiest . once i got out , i never looked back .
it just was n't a smart thing to do . did you sign any sort of paper , or did he have any contract with you saying he would n't broadcast these tapes ?
i 'll join you shortly .
no i 'm not , you mother-fucker !
he took a job . and he fumbled it . now he 's jammed-up . jammed-up bad ...
you just expect me to whip something off , that it ?
james , fall semester , first day of class , it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat .
no offense . there are just some things we need that you probably did n't know to ask .
southern light .
it 's ok. everything 's under control .
i must know .
ho 's a good guy --
onscreen .
i guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things .
< u > get the fucking cells over here < /u > , johns . what 's the discussion ?
you knew when you first saw me . you knew it would be like this .
she 's doing like those iranians . `i divorce thee . i divorce thee . i divorce thee '
deepcore , this is cab one . we need assistance , over . deepcore , this --
i do n't want to confuse him , stephen .
shut ...
there was n't any motive ... let 's try out the act .
yeah ... there 's a lot on tv .
i think a skin cell抯 the more likely of the two .
shh ! just a second .
my , my ... ah , who are you ?
wonderful !
a great deal .
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess .
i do n't care to bargain .
i think clinton is a breakthrough . shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald . is that right ? it proves he 's a liar . keep on it , bill .
do n't turn on the lights , sugar . i 'll lead you around .
mr. streiger , speaking frankly -- we 've appreciated the sergeant 's interest you know , all along . here , locally . but new york , that 's - well --
nothing .
i 've never heard you express any desire to leave before now . why now ?
somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome , i 'd suppose .
i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way , mr. torrance . i fear that is the only thing to do .
no - i did n't kill him . would you rather i 'd let them kill us - after they 'd raped me ... ?
you have it ...
that 's because i wanted them to !
you 're thinking with your brain instead of your body . that 's why you 're so tense ! forget norbert . relax . it 's body time .
i have interrupted the course of the voyage .
here i am . i think i 'm spinning ... we 're both falling , talby , in opposite directions , away from each other . my -- my jetpack 's gone .
he 's expecting you ?
well ?
`` but what if i wish to be purple ? ''
no more .
every one of 'em ... .
of course it was . otherwise i 'd be breaking and entering . that 's a felony .
we did ... ?
the napkin will keep . i 'd rather not be alone .
hell , baby , i bet you think we got tails .
next time , i do the driving .
they 'll be back in a week .
then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he < u > likes < /u > having his prize specimen under glass ... it 's ironic , is n't it ? you 're finally the perfect woman for him ... because you 're his < u > science project < /u > .
i too was blind . i knew about her - and i did nothing . i trusted too much .
oh man , what the hell happened ?
i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand .
good heart , at what ?
good luck . dougherty out .
i liked it a lot . a lot of improvements . it just seemed overall , i do n't know , tighter , more ... congealed or something .
positive .
you stay inside . i will see to them .
of course he does . what about you ? have you just never had one with kevin -- or have you never had one , period ?
how do you know it 's a she ?
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw .
you 've never been born . you do n't exist . you have n't a care in the world .
the < u > reason < /u > i lied is if i 'd told you the truth , you 'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you 're doing .
what ?
when you eat him , may i have some ?
will you just tell me one thing ?
the ancient greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring vrykolaka --
what 's between you and her is between you and her . but here 's what 's between you and me . everybody has a hero , danny . and you 're mine .
he thinks it 's too ...
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
dream -- nightmare is more like it .
billings , if hitler did n't kill six million , why is he your hero ? ... concentration camps all over europe , and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand ... . he 's a putz .
i was ... crazy ... desperate . i took it out on you . i did n't mean it . i know what she sees in you . you 're kind and you 're brave . if i ever get out of you , i 'll be glad to call you my friend .
lad , may i have a word with you ?
you mean the one who --
what is it , johnnie ?
better sign in first , has n't we ?
did you find something ?
-- that edge !
does n't mean you had to marry her .
that 's awful generous of you . i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome .
i was hoping to get some understanding from you . and i 'm not getting it .
well ? ... what 'll you do ?
what 's his first name ?
< b > knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think i 'd die for < /b >
sure of what ? who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle ? results are what lareaux would want .
but you 're not < u > done < /u > !
i do n't care about that . there 's time left . you can have more money . you can drink all you want . you can talk or listen . just stay , that 's all i want .
oh !
where you going ?
that 's a lotta crap .
leaving them here when we could just as well take them . we got plenty of room in the wagon . and -- and -- they cook and drive the mules . they do n't bother anybody .
that 's my point . for thirty years you 've been looking through things and under things and behind things . well what i 'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things . he said our enemy in already here . well maybe it is . maybe our enemy is , literally , already here .
-- you should get back into bed .
after all this mess then .
ya know , entry level !
dad , i got ta tell you this ... cause you should know . cause i still remember .
of course ... well yeah , a bit . `` sin city '' by the flying burrito brothers is an all-time top five , but i would n't play it at the club . it 's a country-rock ballad . everybody 'd go home .
is it true ?
what about our end ?
'my father 's house has many mansions . '
why are you taking that ?
you remind me of my daddy , you know ? mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies . he had a long nose , too , like theirs . did i ever tell you how he died ?
why not ? what i 'm trying to say is that i 'm all wrong for you . you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
nigel , get out of here . and do n't come slithering back . nigel shakes his head .
you asked for shoe polish .
damn skippy . he like it , too .
your voice is saying no , but your body is saying yes .
yeah , well i 'll be joining you shortly . i just want to ...
i am , master shakespeare .
just keep looking at that beautiful sky .
yeah , well , obviously it was n't meant to be . i 've got forty-eight hours . i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened .
fuck it .
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio , did n't you ?
they want your autograph .
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away , to quit the business .
i want to thank you .
i have n't any .
how much time does that give us ?
oh . yeah . thanks .
let 'em come . i 'm ready .
cannon or gatling ?
and they 'll go out the minute there 's another ray . a cylinder reported down by huntington beach . that 's a job for the navy .
it must be serious , swana . not long ago i 'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class . now i can say it without stammering , without a blush . i 'm in love , swana .
control ? ! you never had control ! i was overwhelmed by the power of this place . so i made a mistake too . i did n't have enough respect for that power , and it 's out now . you 're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces . john , there 's nothing worth picking up . the only thing that matters now are the people we love . alan , lex , and tim . and john , they 're out there where people are dying - - people are dying , you know ?
if you say so .
do you like red ?

just , realize ... this is not some common lunatic . the type of intestinal fortitude it must take ... to keep a man bound for a full year . to connect tubes to his genitals . to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints . he 's methodical and exacting , and worst of all , he 's patient .
the child she carried was eight months grown at least ... near to birthing . the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly .

you 're only twenty-five tons off quota . barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day . it 's just a day off . you do n't have to take it , i just thought it might help .
dipper needed it .
yawp !
here . let me put these in some rubbing alcohol .
all right , father , i 'll ask him ! if i risk my neck for you , will i get a chance to kill englishmen ?
what are you doing ?
you wanted me to kill him , did n't you ?
she needs direction ... and training .
no .
yeah , me neither . it was one of my favorites . me and faith in a hot tub on my birthday . i 'm going to really miss it .
this is where my journey started ... right here .
they were very upset .
motion sensors . looks like zone three .
right . it was extremely stupid .
can the kid walk ?
how is her family going to feel about it ?
annie made them .
that 'll be their second worst mistake .
i 'm afraid it 's the `` van '' again .
well i do n't want to do something like that .
never even been to new madrid .
so could half the women in here . and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ? to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ...
it 's never your fault , bernie ! never ever ! you screwed up my life , now you 're gon na screw up joey 's life , but you 're never gon na accept responsibility for anyth --
witch ? huh ! i 'm not afraid of a witch ! i 'm not afraid of anything -- - except a lighted match .
and that would ruin your reputation how ?
get that fucking thing away from me !
yes well ... you are a credit card holder , are you not ?
the news these days ... weird . people looking to superheroes for their peace of mind , and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves , or their spouses at least .
it 's just ... you 've been acting kinda strange , you know ?
did you ... did you ...
your daughter needs you . go .
we 'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it .
you 're ruining my life ' because you wo n't be normal , i ca n't be normal .
what okay ?
he 's lying through his ass !
selectman ? selectman of the village ? me ?
looking for you .
i know . but i 'm the only father you 've got .
where are you going ?
do you know this man ? is there something between you ?
there ai n't none in your daddy . you know , what happened has just made me love him all the more . i not only love him , i respect him , i admire him .
well , it 's a good morning , anyway .
for example , he 's just come back from a < u > fire < /u > and he ... um ... that 's a fine house . you look at that , and you know , there 's nice people that live there .
probably hit by a car . hard to see things in the twilight .
yes .
when can i have one ?
yes , < u > camp < /u > , i thought that meant holiday inn , i never heard `` tents '' , will there be toilets ?
how long have i been here ?
scobie was able to travel , but carson dyle was clearly dying , so they --
cowan . do you ever think that maybe , just maybe , other people might be right and you might be wrong ?
darling susan .
... we had a script conference ...
do n't take anything .
no , not in the shop . but i can order them for you .
the last time i took orders from you i ended up with five years probation .
do n't give me that shit . you know exactly how much you lost . what 'd you drop ?
could you slow down a little ? or we could wait for the car ...
please please please . i 'll do anything . just do n't call my mom .
consigned to flames of woe .
well , if your breath is as sweet as your personality , i got a lot to look forward to . adios .
oh , well , we 'll just have to try again . sound like a plan ?
it 's better than springtime .
the sheriffs will take over when they get here .
it was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but i understand you 're a difficult man to see . i thought you 'd have the solution by this time .
i hear a train coming . drink .
that 's not a bad place to start .
how 'd hear about it ?
i got ta tell you something . i kind of fell in love with her last night .
okay . lowell ?
maybe .
may i have this dance , miss ?
a prairie oyster , sir . [ 10 ]
and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow , is n't he ?
little bit .
here we go !
smith ! wake up !
you knew which man ?
do n't be . your movie 's a hit .
it 's because he comes off as the underdog .
well ... with the hotel that 's ten ... fifteen ...
what else you got ?
no , sir !
no ... i want to be confessed .
it was before you started going out . we had lunch at that inn on the lake .
your ranger 's on the garbage pile , happy ! he 's done for !
yep , it 's all yours .
of course not . you have all the blankets . it must be ten degrees in here . i 'm telling you , sarah , if you want to sleep with fresh air , you sleep on the fire escape . from now on that window is closed .
`` honeymoon , honeymoon ,
remember that day ?
you 're too old for that kind of stuff , kiddo . i thought you stopped doing that long ago .
by the x .
no --
okay . let 's do me .
oh , just that he loves her . that she 's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world . how he adores siena . how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to .
what about containment , alan ?
that 's our place .
the man in the garden . he was full of courage .
and this is the evening edition . notice anything ?
what responsibility ?
abby , never point a gun at anyone unless you 're gon na shoot him . and when you shoot him you better make sure he 's dead ...
i look over at this one nexta me , not bad , about thirty-five -- hiya , marty ...
get real . i was useful to damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on . now that it 's over , all bets are off .
... i do n't know .
and its purpose ?
what ! ? !
yes , she is .
just use the keyboard ...
ceremony ?
i do n't think we 're being treated fairly , lois . and i 'm going to tell miss warfield .
there are no objections to my staying here with her , are there ?
i think , he 's really nice ... he 's a funny guy ... sometimes even very moving .
i do n't need kuato for that .
nice hops .
be it so ordered . the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question . this hearing is adjourned .
i 'll make some for you ! you will come today ?
think ... do any of these kids look familiar in any way ?
and your billing address and the name as it appears on the card ?
do n't con me .
we appear to have plenty of time .
okay . i just came in to get warm , myself . come on , let 's go .
ok .

right on the first guess .
of course , yes . but now eat we must . good food , i have good food . come , come .
officer , i can explain .
i 'd say that 's a pretty good assumption .
that motherfucker --
rose , i do n't have time for this .
what else ? i had the boy teach me kendo . including ... the importance of the bow .
camels , same as me ... guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness .
over there by the bar .

ydob eht ni mraw si ti ! uoy ees i ! tseirp a si eh ! emit su evig ! nirrem ! nirrem !

no one knows how cancer begins , either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it .
no one . but i 'm a little nervous .
it 's november .
and it 's the same story over here . why the crossover ? theories .
you never think to protect yourself with real friends . you think it 's enough to be an american . all right , the police protects you , there are courts of law , so you do n't need a friend like me . but now you come to me and say don corleone , you must give me justice . and you do n't ask in respect or friendship . and you do n't think to call me godfather ; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder ... for money .
wait a minute ... i 've been looking at this all wrong ... let 's look at it the other way ...
the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . budget only calls for three drinks per extra . fake the rest .
you 're like an undercover guy !
chick-en .
if you think you can take me , quit fucking bullshitting and try it .
going to run him through the fluoroscope ?
see my mother ?
you killed the doctor too soon , you fool !
do you want me to go on with this ?
do you want to sleep on it ?
i thought you say tuesday .
i 'm just going to my room .
you 're not going out right away , are you ?
ladies and gentlemen , please put your hands together for my friend , my very best friend , julie james .
are you kidding ? and face a court- martial ?
... but who cares ? it was just -- it was fabulous .
there are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries . they 're dissolving , case ... slowly , but they 're definitely dissolving . you have just long enough to do the job .
who the hell is this ! ?
just a little -- you know .
go where ?
mr. sulu ... the shields !
the streamers ? they 're no problem , you just pull on them and --
i knew you were going to say that . i do n't buy it , and i do n't see a case .
lock the door behind you .
no one 's ever done it before . it was a good try ...
antonio , the choir ...
she 'll never call again . she called last week to tell me she 'll never call again . where 's sally ?
you got it ! wait here while i change .
we feel the bigger concern is gordon liddy ...
good heavens no . that 'd create the very worst impression . you must be optimistic . you must convince them . you know as well as i do that the merger must go through .
my massacre at paris is complete .
well , would you like to know who it was you were marrying ?
terrific ! who was that black guy ? a friend of yours ?
the police , then ...
i ca n't help it . you do n't know ... ..
i could do it . remember the day you wanted the pencil ? i know why . and i saw that car again . i wrote the license number in my notebook . except i missed the last number .
for what ?
what are you an idiot !
of course .
where is she ? where is the girl ?
what 've you got ?
crane .
i 'll be alright .
yeah , and hurry up .
what do you mean , was .
i 'm a little scared of storms . always have been . since i was a kid .
hey-
what guns ?
are you afraid ?
did you take it from the street in front of your work ?
dunbar will testify that you were .
meaning time came , i left .
i ... i guess i might ... but like i said , i ai n't armed .
well , same ol ' same ol ' .
have you been to any parties ?
nothing .
what were you showing her ?
what makes you ask ?
blind pete taught me a great trick .
it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information . a remarkably efficient system .
i did n't see that much of it -- same as now . i only saw it as part of my own life .
about mr. powell . all of it !
in the cash register . step away from the door .
i need a cigarette ! she left my office four years ago , we 're looking for a chart ... i need a cigarette ...
and you could care less --
i want you to talk dirty to me .
yes , sir , that 's the truth . but do n't blame him . the fault is mine . i was too indulgent with him . but not again . never again , i promise ! i implore you - let me bring him back here . i 'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully .
spot right here .
i do n't have to go through with it either .
we need help . we deserve help .
he 's got a gun , sir .
get me a dr. peppa ! i do n't want no pepsi . pepsi ai n't nothing but flavored water .
when am i going to see you ?
i found it , evy ! i found it
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this .
that has my work number , my home number , my pager number . i sleep three hours a night . call me whenever you want to talk . off the air , on the air , whenever . okay ?
i 'd like to come along . there 's been a lot of strain , and i 've been cooped up in this room for three days .
nothing .
very impressive .
well , i hope you 're not going to dictate whom i can talk to .
can we see ?
well , in the meantime , could you let me have $ 50 personally ?
i 'll call them and tell them you 're taking your time . being a professional .
i do n't know . forty-eight , i guess .
police ?
let me by .
i 'd like that .
well you could 've at least warned me . you know i hate the zap ... when they die . it just brings down your whole day . jeez , tick .
did that thrill , impress and overwhelm you ?
i am delighted ; any chance to go aboard enterprise , however briefly , is always an excuse for nostalgia .
like cattle ...
well , mademoiselle , he 's the kind of a man that , well , if i were a woman and i ... were not around , i should be in love with rick . but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man .
what i need , i ca n't get from doctor crusher ... counselor , do you think it 's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they 've made ?
he 's done it before . other countries . lumumba in the congo , trujillo , the dominican republic , he 's working on castro . no big deal . in september , kennedy announces the texas trip . at that moment , second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket . y flies in the assassins , maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens , greece - pros , maybe some locals , cubans , maria hire , separate teams . does it really matter who shot from what rooftop ? part of the scenery . the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone ...
i am a tourist .
it 's okay , rose . you can go with him .
but there 's something profound here , maxine , we ca n't exploit it .
my blood will soon reverse its flow . it 's the same poison she used to kill my master . there is no antidote .
victor . he was trying to be gracious .
keep going .
rooney 's protecting someone . who is she protecting ?
not even if it gives you a clean bill of health ?
they can know all they like , it wo n't do them the slightest bit of good --
so . what 's your point ?
no !
ladies and gentlemen , there is no need to go there . we can all agree to disagree without making threats .
would you like to come in and see my house ? just for a minute .
mama . i been thinkin ' about her . she 's prob'ly worried to death by now .
one of my men is down . i want to know what happened to him .

millions upon millions upon millions ! the cards . the stock ! the clothes ! the toothpaste ! the guy was on the level ! and you blew it ! a man walks into your life who is the kindest , most polite , honest , trustworthy , incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life ! ! and what do you do ? !
... their damned souls will be ours .
bluff . you 've waited too long .
i did n't think it would . she 's calling herself l.a. joan this- week . last week it was dakota . guess if you have to change your name a state 's as good as anything .
she 's the captain , we should listen to --
what if we fall ? i hate trees .
yeah , well , you know these japanese management techniques . could you , uh , read me the number on the modem ?

my husband is a very courageous man .
do n't be bloody silly . you 're the first since monday .
but i 'm clean .
there is no softer ground than town .
i 'd call them excuses . and the first excuse on both our lists was our `` sense of duty . '' we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else . and you know what ? it 's not .
wheee ! faster !
i understand , but annie , please ...
maybe plans changed ...
oh . yeah .

you do n't like coconuts ! say , brainless , do n't you know where coconuts come from ? lookit here 枛 from tahiti 枛 fiji islands , the coral sea !
i know about you .
you think i care about their * cause ? or yours ? not at all . * see , america is on top now . . * . but so was rome , once . all * civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and ... living * well takes money . *

get the car . i 'll be leaving in ten minutes . where 's calo ?
water mains usually go in the winter . it 's august 1st .
i know exactly what you mean ! hey , honey ?
a flare ? a flare wo n't do it .
a bit melodramatic ? but if you could prove it ? that would tie in your unified field theory , the big bang , kaluza-klein --

thank you , harry .
hey , just cancel that shit right now ! you 're hurt . you 're hurt really fucking bad , but you ai n't dying .

calm , dishonorable , vile submission ! thou art my souls hate ! tybalt ! you ratcatcher , will you walk ?
for what ? oh , i 've see the way the other half lives . my sister , for instance . it looks terrific , but is that what i really want ? three kids , two cats , and fifteen needlepoint pillows ? i 'd go bananas after one week . hell , i need this crazy existence of mine . like i need the plague , right ? that 's what your thinking .
skull was intact , no soft tissue left -- not much to go on .
jesus . what are you doin ?
he 's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one .
cypher , i thought --

i do n't know why i said that . she 's not dead at all .
helena , i 'm so sorry --
i agree .
lamagra is n't a physical being . he 's a spirit , requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself .
i just wanted to ask you ...
who 's a yo-yo ... ? who do you think 's a yo-yo ! they 're all yo yo 's . i mean they 're all great guys , for christ 's sake , but ... the point is , nick , without you i 'd hunt alone . seriously . i would . that 's what i 'd do .
we let you down , did n't we . your people .
why ca n't he help me now ? he 's sitting two feet away from me !

kiss , kiss ?
try some deep breathing .
too bad . the men 've always wanted to get a look at the president . but you 've come out here to settle the strike ?

that 's a heavy sedation .
dorothy , please ! we 're trying to count ! fifty-eight --
never won a race . but it got me in with the trainer . we 'd have a thing , i do n't remember , some fucking thing . the jockey would raise his whip , it meant the fix was in , we 'd all go running . people get greedy . first they bet small , they keep their mouth shut . within a month 's time , everyone and their brother was in on it . the odds would drop , i mean you could watch the goddamn board . it looked like a fuckin stopwatch , the odds would drop so fast .
how many times do i have to tell you -- i have a system here . where the hell is that thing ?
i 'm not getting a ticket .
what 's wrong honey .
that 's not true . it was 1620 .

that would be just fine . hello , charlie , this is melanie . i want you to do a favor for me . no , this is a small one . pressure you ? why , charlie darling , would i try to pressure you ? will you call the department of motor vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate ? dkq dash one seven six . yes , a california plate . no , i 'll stop up there in a little while . is daddy in his office ? oh . no , no , i do n't want to break in on a meeting . just tell him i 'll see him later . thank you , charlie .

i could be convinced to abandon my writing , quite voluntarily .
your daddy will always love you .
there 's a big , comfy california king over in bedding . what say we ...
or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for ...
do n't threaten me . i tend to take these things seriously . and get a couple hours sleep . you look like day old shit .

laura , i am your friend .
at last she arrives , my hard-won bride ! hurry , my child , and scurry inside . there you 'll find such treasures await you ; marzipan and meringue to sate you !
in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you .

thinkin ' a second , baby .
i 've got twenty hours left . i could die in here . and you 're falling in love .
i ai n't going no place with you !
claremont , you 're a chubby chaser .

i addressed the chair first , sir !
someday this luau is going to be all mine !
dude in the dress is eddie solomon , used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself . word on the street was he was saving up for an operation .
a `` he-man '' ? sure . they shine that beacon in the sky , then wonder what hole i crawl out of .
move 'em to texas , fry 'em up .
what do you know about the highlands ?
think about it man . nine men , six bullets .
josh !
boat has two batteries . lose one you run off the other til morning . carl musta lost both , so miyamoto there gave him one a his .
these `` methods '' of yours ... there has been no practical application .
good evening . it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary .
i know , but she did . she 's with someone else now ...
these antidote filters the professor 's whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday , as arachtoidal creatures . they wo n't be pretty , nothing personal , john parker . but just remember ... if we fail tonight , there 's no tomorrow .

oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .

it 's not my father 's money , it 's the foundation 's . why did he think you had it ? and who does ?
it 's a generous offer , mr. galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ...
i do n't know .

sweet .
it 's just another case , sailor .
... will you stay with me till they get here ?
like what ? i got a little power , sure . a touch of the shining , a little of the sight . but no more than you do . we 're not witches . i ca n't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away . besides , maybe they deserve it . maybe we all do .
it goes fast , all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast , marty , i will have a new job . singing soprano with the vienna boys ' choir .
because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' .
do you have it ?
what message ? what motorboat ?
what was all that ?
well i 've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and i 'm still like this . they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they 're in technicolor .
what you then ?
i 've got some things to tell you .
yes , sir .
that money is my whole future .
yes , it was reported , but never substantiated .
i do n't play for no team .
then fuck what your father said , cause i 'm gon na tell you right now ... you 'll know what it 's all about , why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning , and the streetlight 's coming through the window and it 's just catching a corner of her face , like a sleeping angel . and her hair smells sweet and she 's your 's . she 's all your 's . do you see where i 'm going here ?
i came down here to close a deal for studebaker .
no death certificates . no crime .
dave , may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory ?
that 's pretty good .
i do n't know . national cash register ?
there 's one in every story .
yes , it must be hard to be a policeman . is it hard ? must one , then , be constantly suspicious ?
is this about the funny money ?
he has ? .. what 's he doing here ?
'63 chevy .
look , i 'm sorry . i know you said not to talk , but when i saw the crowd i just got excited ...
would n't be no use . i 'd still see 'em inside the tent .
roy , you 're a short-con operator . and a good one , i think . do n't talk to me like i 'm another square .
mm-hmm ...
he already thinks you 're out of your mind , louise , that do n't carry much weight with darryl . are you at work ?
how would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children ? it 'd be fun , would n't it ? maybe they 'd murder each other ... keep it all in the family . that 's what father should have done . he should have killed me and gilbert ... then we would n't have had this to go through .
oh . i 'm sorry . gideon , what do you say ?
`` mad about the boy . ''
we did n't ask for your opinion , doctor .
sure ... if i were interested . but i do n't think it 'd be much fun .
no wonder they lost america . how could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that ? what 's to eat ?
put down lex luthor !
sorry , em , i wanted it to be like ... a big surprise for you and pee .
i feel like i 've been wandering in the desert for as long as i can remember . with nothing but emptiness around me , wind and sun ... and suddenly , out of the blue , somehow i 've found the oasis .
if you must know , virtually nothing .
are you there ?
by the way , there 's a meeting this afternoon . you coming ?
that is correct , commander . and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .
will she like it ?
we got it locked in the sock .
do n't think of it in terms of right and wrong . she is a guide , neo . she can help you find the path .
well , hello . have n't seen you in a long time .
do n't eat at the console .
took the kids to his mom 's for the weekend .
i do . i 'd just feel happier if you were with us .
whatever you do , just ... do n't stop .
do n't look like there 's a right way .
no ...
why ?
what will you do now ?
we have n't talked since high school .
what books ?
do n't !
... nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline ...
that 's good , hilda . i 'm glad .
we have nothing to discuss .
- do n't run out of adjectives , dear .
jeff -- this is mr. taylor .
no , i got nothing till tuesday .
your work , the layers of irony .
damn . let 's go .
why ?
one of these cities , is the place you seek . the teller of truths will take you there . but the city of lies , is dark and bleak . and death is certain if you enter , beware .
claire ...
telly 's not here right now . i believe he went downtown . casper too .
did n't you get ? ... how are you ?
those targeting mirrors are frozen . the sun beam wo n't work .
are you trying to tell me that the houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure mrs. holland ?
you 're doing fine .
louise ! where are you ? are you alright ? honey ...
what was your price ?
... i wo n't go into that today . though , if we should continue these sessions , as i certainly hope we will , there are some aspects of that i would like to look at . god knows , i 've listened to enough people giving me the juicy -- ... at any rate , i just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me . i just hope that it does n't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow .
and you , there are many places to get away . why here ?
you know mark ratner really likes you . you like him ?
it 's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one .
is this leading somewhere ?
would you want to sit out a war ? i mean -- what would be left .
i do n't know why we have to watch tv .
i do n't believe this . the world 's under attack by the legions of the undead and you 're going to a mixer ?
big symbols make big targets , jordan . i think someone 's gunning for you .
yes , captain brynner , you did , but-but --
promise ?
you ...
where 'd you ever get an idea like that ?
where did it all come from ? or is that a permissible question ?
hoop , this is n't a hoop , it 's a lethal weapon . have you got a licence for it ?
so it 's like you want to be secret friends .
so , it 's from the future , is that right ?
not at all . it 's damned interesting .
no -- but i 'm sure it 'll be all right with walter .
you 'll have to get use to dr. malcolm ! he suffers from a deplorable excess of personality , especially for a mathematician !
i 've always wanted to kill someone . can i do it ?
adrian -- you 've lost it .
she 's in california . that 's wild enough , i guess .
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy .
i 'm not sure . as you know , the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years . species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct . this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant .
two , please .
really ?
god , man !
-- yes . actually we just bought that little frank lloyd wright on pine avenue ... debi 's a social worker and i mow down insurance claims at aetna --
oh my god ! i almost forgot -- i got you a meeting with the admissions guy from dartmouth !
if you like that type .
oh yes .
hi .
you must really like him .
then prove it . lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission . . .
oh yeah . oh that 's load off . i thought everybody gone crazy .

michael , are you still in bed ?
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier ...
like it was yesterday .
c抦on jack ...
eh , have you got paul 's grandfather ?
captain , we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed ...
it 's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this ?
yes . yes . a thousand times , yes !
why they call you that ?
doctor lady make it irey .
i just asked a simple question .
all right , run 'em off .
that 's where we came out .
you are one of krypton 's greatest scientists jor-el -
yeah , well it 's not everyday you get news like this . you 're sure he 's okay ? other than the bump on the head ?
you 're paying the bills .
yes , sir , but ... do you think gray 'll go for it ?
why is n't she with you ?
oh , hello mrs. swicker .
thirty . name your price . everyone has a price , what 's yours ?
where are you staying in vancouver royal . it 's pretty crowded you know .
i got sent .
yes she did .

well , that defies the point , do n't it ?
okay , sister . no offense . no offense !
she 's keeping his name . and one of his planes . and all seven of his children
yes , we do ... and i can give you a tie and jacket .
i heard voices .

they 're all on microfiche . what year are you looking for ?
it 's 7:30. you really should get a watch .
hey , fuck you , man .
suppose i go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar . how 's that ?
you say we go ?
dude , if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it , i 'd give it my best shot . i 'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time . but this ... tribal , ritualistic bullshit , it 's way-too-spontaneous for me .
does n't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? i mean , i can understand the old man 's infatuation with the stuff , but not you .
keaton , we got ta go . they 're gon na find him .
you 're getting warmer .
you 'll be waiting for me ?
jeremy . i 'm going in . i have to do some things .
i 'm glad that 's all over for me .

phase two .
you and frank and cole , and even bob , get all these girls because you 're good looking and famous . you do n't have to pay . they just look at me like i 'm the baby brother . do n't tell anyone , okay jesse ?
but if it does n't happen , grab for something within reach . life 's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
very interesting , bob . let 's make a note of that . andy did n't lose the complaint in his computer . he never put it in . he lied about that , too .
no it could n't .
so do i , jane . i 'm on vacation .

here 's your document , sonny .
mommy wo n't know . you can do anything you want right now . mommy wo n't know .
quite well , really . it 's a lot of work . a lot of reinforcement , mostly positive . right now i 've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins . tiny napkins of course .
it 's rough . but it shows promise . we record a couple of songs right , in a studio . i 'll take care of the rest . i 'll put out your record . any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle , between us and you guys .
i 'm doing that too .
good luck .
i do n't want to talk about it .
never seen a gun fire so fast !
you have to ...
who warned you ?

i 'm tired of dealing with peons . i need to get to whoever 's in charge .
that 's charles ' study . but you do n't have to even look in there . he 'll love whatever you do to it . he 's such a sheep .
you what ?
you mean this thing ?
i 'll make a note of it . anything else ?
i am as well as can be expected .
just a walk , for chrissakes .
but do n't you < u > do < /u > anything . you just have a seat , wait for me to get there .

i 've got a morgue filling up with bodies . that 's my right .
it was not inspired by circumstance .

and let my cry come unto thee .
who is it ?
the best .
oh come on , kathryn , it was just a contest .
no , but i will lock you in .
yeah ? how ?
it does n't matter who i am . who i am means absolutely nothing . you need to turn left here ... at the traffic light .
tell him about baldy .
probably best not tell anyone about this .
mom , please .
your mother called . you should n't upset her like that .
i better keep looking .
that makes two of us . lieutenant saavik was right : you never have faced death --
come on ... even i 'm not that hard on myself .
then why ?
that 's why you waited for me .
in order to succeed , you 're going to have to go old-school . one night boost . put all your nuts in one basket . and ...
so , do you think it 's too much if i wear these in the same day ?
i bet you did . just had to get that black cock up in you . i swear to god . what ronnie sees ... you disgust me .
baby , we 're money .
they did 14 grand in evanston , 16.5 is gary , and 20 in cicero . looks like you 're bringing up the rear , granger .

what about the draft ?
i did .
sssh . what is it ? tell me .
what are you doing ?
oh boy ... in the club , or at home ?
not even the slightest hint of something ?
really . you 'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no mcp looking over your shoulder .
right . everything 's the same , except one change ...
cover the ribs -- look here , elbow down , tight -- tight -- stand straight -- you 're the best , you 're the best !
but alone ? we always had great success together , you and i .
no cowboy shit up there , understand ?

that 's worth fifteen grand to ya ?
what 's the matter , matt ? gee , i thought you 'd be thrilled to death .
are you all right ?
it 's alright . i think he got the message anyway .
it 's very monotonous .
modred has treated with the dark ones .
my father . he 's not just the ultimate square . he 's a total crook .

not that much appreciation . i thought we were gon na tone down that flabby ass .
do you have any lesions on < u > any < /u > part of your body , at this time , that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired ?
sometimes i wonder what i 'll do if carl does n't get out . i 'm not very adept at being on my own . i 've always had a man in my life . always .
fine newspaper the tribune .
yoooooow .
seven hundred for the pair .
why baseball ?
'yes ' is the answer to your ques- tion .
see for yourself .
and i did n't like that man .
i guess there 's probably a story behind that .
what 's your favorite movie star ?
he walks in the rain , without his hat , and talks to himself .
they 'll understand us , all right !
thank you . thank you , sir ...
you do whatever you want . do i keep my promises , or do i keep my promises ?
i must ... consult with my father .
sure you do -- you win either way .
yes . unlike our syndicates , your criminals do n't understand the words 'honor ' and 'duty ' ... we ca n't afford not to deal with them .
listen , he 's nuts . i mean certifiable . but believe it or not , he once looked great in levis . that 's why my mother married him . but like all good things ... i know what you 're thinking .
very well , mr. chekov , see to it . viewer off .
yes !
nothing . something i - forget it .
which way ?
... her mother needs an operation ...

very funny .
mouse ? what mouse ?
there are a few million miles to go yet .
why is he not here ?
the lesabre !
i do n't know .
hotel ? what were they doing in a hotel ?
sometimes i feel like my parents do n't love me .
what 's that , walter ?
sonny will come after you with everything he 's got .
got it .
when i was ten , my family lived in pacifica for a year . i used to go to the beach everyday that summer . i never felt so happy , carefree . it was a magic place for me ... that 's where my heaven will be .
you were going to say something .
what have you done to my flat ?
that shit is nothin ' . i remember , i had just turned 14. with this fuckin ' asshole who was like 18. i do n't even remember his name . i think it was john or jake or something . i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean . this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit .
no ... no .
that 's not quite what i said --
what a pity .
but i guess my best just is n't good enough .
let 's look anyway .
maybe we don韙 have to know what he looks like . if he韘 got that list , he韘 going to want to check it . we should be looking for laptops .
okay -- i mean --
success or nothing ?
yes ... ?
i do n't know .
no . you know what gets old ? being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up .
actually , you may take it all now .
three games to two . but if you know their history , you realize there 's a tragedy in the making . i 've been carrying this franchise on my back since i was six years old .
well ! what do you want me to do - applaud ?
like jumping into a fountain in rome !
vehicle references .
that is correct .
not her . me . they 're beautiful , are n't they ? the stars . i never just look anymore and they 're beautiful .
you still going to all the home games ?
then that 's all i have to say . dismissed .
that 's low , but this effects me how exactly ?
the wise snake coils before he strikes .
yes , sir ... but if you 're wrong , < u > captain < /u > clayton , do n't ever give me another !
sorry ...
romeo , o romeo ! wherefore art thou romeo ? deny thy father and refuse thy name ; or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , and i 'll no longer be a capulet .
i know . he loves that thing .
... just like the mouse .
exactly . i would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things . or could mean lots of things .
it 's him .
well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it .
i do n't mind if i do .
no . but i wanted to .
yes , madam . and now madam will sleep . it is not long 'till the train .
willoughby . john willoughby , long john willoughby they called me in baseball .

this is the staff of the bijou .

it ai n't getting any prettier , that 's for sure . i got the i.d . on this armitage character . he a bright boy , your friend ?
who 's the hostage , sayer , her or you ? you look kind of `` captive '' yourself . while you 're spending every waking hour obsessing over simone , guess what , i guarantee she does n't even know you exist . get off my property or i 'll call the cops .
scott and kate .
ouch !
you are a very perceptive young woman .
doyle 's the name , sir . of the connemara doyles . and there 's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself . that having been said , sir , you 're five minutes late so let 's be on our way ! your friend 's already aboard .

a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you 're still alive .
oh , but it is mine too !
codes are for < u > hiding < /u > information . so it 's making a mistake . it 's making a code without intending to . i figured it 's probably substituting numbers for letters ... then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard . and since we 're getting spirals , i imagined the keyboard as a spiral . so i translated it ...
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car 's his .

no , it is n't that , i can assure you . i would n't be afraid in the face of real danger . i 've proved that to myself . on the other hand , if a stranger visited me simply to say hello , i 'd be alarmed .
no sir . i 'm a veteran .
well do some looking around the room . i see cups , ashtrays - let 's go ...
janie ?
i read , cooch .
poor bastard .
i need you , swede , i ca n't do this without you !
i like to expand my horizons .
sounds like something you feed the dog .
of what ?
there were others .
yes .
are they still together ?
yes .
i 'm opening the side door . she 'll step out . but before she gets in your vehicle i want to see the first installment put down in plain view . if it is n't there i 'm shooting her in the back .
i did not , grandma .
then what do you do ?
not all heroes wear masks .
object to the form of the question !
last night ? ... there was no applause .
is he circumcised ? can you imagine what his anus is like ? describe it to me . would you like to sodomize him ? would you like to put your penis right into his anus , thrust it up his anus ? tell me , describe it to me . tell me what you would do . how would you kiss him in that car ? describe how you 'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans , then take out his penis . would you kiss it or suck it right away ? which hand would you hold it in ? have you ever sucked a penis ? do you know what semen tastes like ? have you ever tasted semen ? some semen is saltier than others . vaughan 's semen must be very salty ...
you 're saying , do n't make the kids a football , do n't put them through a war . but i 'm doing this for < u > their < /u > well-being .
forget the jewish stuff . it does n't play anymore . there 's only the market , now , and it does n't care who you are .
hi , i'm-i 'm tony lacey .
de moraes ? i was asked here by a mrs spitz .
ach soooooooooo . mildred no grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation . harold would come home trumpeting and roaring . he would the kick the furniture with his boots , spit into corners and the fireplace . he would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them . he would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him , and he 'd tear off my clothes . he would carry me into the bedroom , telling me to scream and kick my feet . that was very important to him . i did it . i tried to be a good wife . he told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo . i could n't do that , but i pretended i did . it was all over -- ten seconds after he 'd said the word `` buffalo . '' then he 'd zip up his pants , and go outside , and tell true war stories to the little kids . any little kids .
then we 'd both have a miserable time . what do you think ?
yes , i would .
int . postal van - day .
they decreed me a savage , and now they have made me one .
roy , that 's fine , but i do n't have time for this . bobo --
okay , fine , whatever , yes -- it 's an < u > old < /u > tree .
well , it was nice to meet you . surreal but nice .
and the cost of it all , deputy minister ? seven percent of the gross national produce ...
thank you for accepting .
i 'd love to ! or should i pretend i 'm busy ?
well , do n't ask me to .
why you 're here ?
i sure as hell hope so . let 's go .
i would n't know , dude . i deal in publishing , entertainment , political advocacy , and --
you could have looked in my car . oh , but you did n't know my car , did you ?
i 'm sure the lady knows her own mind . does n't she ? let her decide the proper suitor .
it was fine .
joe ! a little snifter . say , was n't i a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that , huh ? look at that ! i do n't know how i rate that , gallagher . gosh , there 's a swell girl . i want you to meet her .
where am i ?
it was you ! i thought i heard ...
the hell i do n't .
because there 's one thing about these old timers : they do n't like any fuckin ' around with the other guy 's wives . it 's bad for business .
o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you . she is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies over men 's noses as they lie asleep ; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat , and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; o'er lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again . this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage : this is she -- this is she !
mom , ca n't you tell him that i 'm sick ?
i 'll borrow it from you . four million - -
he is --
becky ?
yes --
she should n't have come back . she knew she was in danger .
i 'm worried about someone .
he 's knocked out ! he 's knocked out ! dr. grant ! dr. grant ! daddy , daddy !
the white castle has fallen .
you will . look , nuke -- these big league hitters are gon na light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile -- do n't worry about it . be cocky and arrogant even when you 're getting beat . that 's the secret . you got ta play this game with fear and arrogance .
forty-five cigarettes . the price has gone up .
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change .
he did n't tell you either .
not at all , dr. lester . i simply misspoke .
i 'll take you back to the hotel .
conklin .
how does she draw ?
oh sure ... you bet . betty ...
no use waiting , then .
yes , sir .
because i do n't know .
no , i mean it .
he is older than i .
do n't be afraid of him none . i do n't care what he does to you , we can still be together .
no , this is great .
you ca n't . you 're going to be valedictorian .
well ... g'bye .
jesus , annie , i do n't know --
good morning !
it 's the engine , reactors , audiometers , it 's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom .
how 'bout twenty ?
real good , rog ... but maybe you better let me take over .
you 're what ? what the hell have you been doing ?
yes .
just -- bang -- we have a honeymoon .
no . so . is it working out with ian ?
shut your mouth and drive !
goodbye ? where 're you going ? what about our partnership ? i 'm making real progress with the microchip .
no . it 's a real episode . the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones .
what do i have to do for it ?
... then you really are a gardener ?
this is doyle 's house .
that 's why tom wanted you to stay . it 's better than squeezing into my room , and i know how you hate hotels .
i do n't want to place you in any position --
let me show you the entire trousseau !
what 's the matter with you ?
he takes good care of that .
all right , gillis . you 've got five minutes . what 's your story about ?
ca n't you see i 'm strung out ? please , we 're waiting for it -- he 's got to have it !
name a price .
the catacoombs ? whaddya want , a door ? there 's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in istanbul .
you fit a lot of descriptions .
why ?
you 're right . it really gets in the way of my jazzercizing .
if it makes you feel any better , i do n't think you could 've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff .
-- a sense of proportion .
john ? .. you never said that on the phone ? .. what makes you think his name was john ?
two .
in the yellow room , where the music 's playing and the ladies are ?
you got it . what 's happening ?
to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us .
she was a crossbreed , chinese and polish .
it better be fifteen minutes , because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter 's clicking away to beat the band .
ca n't . need water .
it 's for people !
we 're staying in < u > tents < /u > ?
no you 're not .
then v'ger believes the creator to be a < u > machine < /u > too .
yeah .
you 're right .
no one . maybe i dreamed it all up .
are n't you scared ?
understood .
speaking of which . i saw you talking to ronnie this morning . why ca n't you get it back together with her . you 've got ta be out of your mind not to get with that one .
that 's one piece of four problems .
what about back home ?
it was tammy i that 's who it was .
does n't your foot hurt ?
okay . soon ? do you think i 'm too fat ?
just better .
can you fly that thing .
maroon , right ?
are you hungry ? what 's your favorite food ? we 'll try to get it for you .
seriously . what 's it like to be eighteen ?
heard a lot about you , hunt . don韙 disappoint me .
where did you get this clown ?
well , sir , like i said , for the same reasons we do . i mean , all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident , or a mistake , or by some mentally unbalanced person --
yes .
thank you . i would n't want to interrupt anything .
whatever you girls want . it 's on us tonight . sky 's the limit .
what 's this ?
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --
the `` chronicle '' is a good newspaper .
sounds good . oblique but intriguing . phone it in .
forty-seven . you 'd better floor it .
that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?
the sick boy method .
james ... i ca n't begin to tell you how pleased we all are . congratulations , and i really mean it .
from your mouth ta god 's ear .
yeah . so sue me .
you know , april , people pass by vital structures in this city all the time , and they never take the time to appreciate them . i get the feeling you tune in to your environment .
i 'm kate . you must be cledus .
but we civilized it . a place belongs to those who bring light to it , do n't you agree .
-- but you enjoy being the stronger one ? you like the control .
right . i was a great athlete . tell her , max , i was the best , i was all schoolyard .
maybe you left 'em in the bathroom .
i do n't know .

you guys do all the odd jobs .
goosed !
after i left ?
what do i love ? i love rice pudding , and water , the fish in it , hedgehogs ! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths .
maybe if we gave the tapes back --
to forget ? do n't be so motherly , midge . i 'm not going to crack up .
i 'm sorry . my grandson fell and broke his leg .
no brag . just fact .
good gracious ! what is this ?
if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it ?
we talked .
hard to say . if we go for custody , depositions , psychiatric evaluations , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn , assuming they 're unduly restrictive , it would n't be more than twenty-five hundred .
enough ! you better start talkin ' to us , asshole , cause we got shit we need to talk about . we 're already freaked out , we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin ' bag on our hip .
uh ... excuse me , folks ...
... oh , did that hurt ?
well i do n't want to seem desperate or anything .
it was .
yeah , how so ?
oh yeah . they good . ca n't say they ai n't good . i would n't trade them for another pair , tell you that . but you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it . all right ?
your detective told you a nakedfaced lie .
what if you 're one of five ?
i hope you have a second chance ...

faulty wiring .

to see your reaction .
then why do i still have a badge ?
i do n't know . i 'll find out though .
there is no out of here . you 've been killed . do n't you remember ?
buzz off . go patronize somebody else .
you remember how you wanted her , the taste of her -
rob , take the money , okay ? it 's no big deal .
you 're shaking .
is there something bad here ?
no . there must be some in the desk somewhere .
come into the kitchen . i 'm just making your mother 's tea .
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings . in exchange , his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible .
oh , cut my finger .
my father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden .
i 'm going out the front .
three years . a rookie .
what 's the bastard really like ?
thanks , joely . a present ! oh boy !
you 're looking a wee bit green , thomas .
what can i do for you , mr. welles ?
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given . i 'm not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but you must have known i was not a great fool ; you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
back -
thanks very much .
which part ? that or the day-to-day .
fine .
mr. gibbs , organize a cleaning detail -- you and cotton . i want every inch of the pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape !

bill ! bill ! good-bye , bill .
explosive decompression .
that was great .
why ?
not be safe ? what on earth are you talking about ?
mr. bernstein , these men who are now with the `` enquirer '' - who were with the `` chronicle '' until yesterday - were n't they just as devoted to the `` chronicle '' kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper ?
say them .
so , what 're you supposed to be , a lion tamer ?
no , you would n't -- you 're not the sort of woman that 's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- but now let 's talk about your affairs .
what are you doing running through the streets in your underpants ? we both use that body .
yes . yeah , i-i 'm kill --
we have n't build shit . you 're just tearing down your father .
he knows i do not love him .
i do n't know . i just keep going over and over the numbers .
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers .
yeah , a toon . it was the guy who killed bambi 's mother .
you might wan na think about it
maybe we could run some tests . kind of a comparison , the old and the new ...
hey .
you have to say that . you 're my teacher .
ah keeps the ol ' circle turning -- this ol ' clock needs plenty o ' care . time is money , miss archuh , and money -- it drives that ol ' global economy and keeps big daddy earth a-spinnin ' on 'roun ' . ya see , without that capital fo'mation --
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes ...
could be a lot of things . depends on the freezer . i 'm sorry , mack , but i do n't think this is the answer .
i know your mother ai n't still operating that house of hers .
wait a minute . you want to look at fucking penguins now ?
did they try and fail ?
are n't you glad you did n't move up here and marry her ?
`` dear sleepless and son ... ''

no , i got ta - hey , norm , i thought you were goin ' fishin ' up at mile lacs ?
if-god-wills-it !
what ? wha-at ? mrs. hillyer ?
how come jack let 's you work here ?
i saw it ... him . but i got away . and i took the box . and i solved it . and they came .
how old are you ?
that 's it ? hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it . she made us call her a different name . she 'd say , `` you 're talking to betty now '' and we 'd leave the house for a few days .
thanks , chuck .
sorry , di . i was just going to my car . i did n't mean to frighten you ...
why not ?
i look familiar ?
i got a bad feeling , man . i do n't want to go in naked .

victor laszlo is on that plane .
it 's not fair that a man like that has power over our work .
i carried you up to your bed .
he 's an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life .
what 's going on ?
we 're living history here .
now we kill two birds at one stroke . we recruit from scotland for our armies in france .
we do n't have time to argue !
then how did you know ?
i can tell she 's not a killer . you just do n't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation .
the chauffeur . he 's watching .
you think things would be any different now ?
you do n't understand . this is my niece vera .
wladyslaw szpilman .
yeah , i sort of thought so myself .
i woke to the sound of zoe 's breathing . it was laboured . i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen . i grabbed her , rushed to the kitchen , and splashed water on her face .
i 'm getting out of here . what do you think ?
oh i do n't give a shit the guy 's a slob . he does n't even know how to spell `lady ' let alone treat me like one . you know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink ?

god damn it ! i still needed to case that fucking store . it 's too risky to show my face now .
oh this is bad , this is so bad . is it bad ?

we 'll come across him tomorra , i guess .

hi !
of course you did . i said a great flyer , not a smart one . you fly reckless . great instincts . no discipline . that ambush today , you followed your emotions instead of your wingman . of course you got killed ... and well deserved to . it was a really stupid mistake . in battle , it gets people killed .
that 's ... good ?
so if i ran now , there 's no way i 'd beat you , is there ?
well , the doctor says he 's showing some movement . it 's still early , it might mean nothing , but i thought you 'd want to know .

i 've always thought you were a pretty nice guy , brandon . i 'd like to go on thinking so . if you tried to help her get away --

you 're under military arrest , it 's not gon na happen . what 's wrong with baseball ?
i 'm quitting , frank . as of midnight tonight .
nail him first , be careful he does n't panic and want to shoot somebody . local police have one car , a rover , should n't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it 's answering an emergency call ... if the cop car shows up remember it does n't have any automatic weapons . only a shotgun braced on the dashboard . get into a tight spot , you 'll be out of range at forty yards . then they 're down to their side guns .
and it 's sexier in the dark .
it 's not modesty . i just do n't try to kid myself .
well , you 're my pal , are n't you ? then do n't turn female on me .
i 'm not in the way . andy , am i in the way ?
i do n't really think you warrant that strong an emotion .
adam ! calm down .
oh , angela ! go with these trappers ! they 'll lead you safely down the mountain ...
yeah ? well come prom night , those excuses are n't going to do you much good .
yes , sir .
you know -- little worms -- ambition .
what do you mean , ross ?
kurtz . i 'm supposed to kill him , just like he said .
i do n't know . if it was a god , it was searching for a greater one . it was still searching for meaning ...
because you 've been down there , neo . you already know that road . you know exactly where it ends .
how could i ruin myself ? what do you mean , ruin myself ?
thanks .
right here , ben .
where --
i do n't think this is gold .
emmett .
i do n't have any money , solomon . if you fire me --
september 4 -- how far away is that ?
outstanding . then all we need 's a deck of cards . all right , let 's move like we got a purpose .
wait a second ...
jesus christ , pop , let 's go home . i got waylaid . sorry .
i 've been thinking about it for awhile , and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me .
nicky moore . patty ryan . mary finelli . these names mean anything to you , asshole ? julia sullivan ! she mean anything ? she means something to me !
zeke .
you want to tell me about it ?
you think that 's going to work ?
not at all . but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site ?
david ?
i have n't got the job yet .
i need someone to work on budget projections .
is he going to be okay ?
shit .
well let 's do something do you want to do something , can you meet me ?
do you think so ?
oui , da , yessiree , sure 'nuff , you betcha .
very thoughtful . do n't touch it .
but , the expectation was ten . and , in this case , expectation is everything .
then how is it we speak the same language ? even in your lies , some truth slips through ! that mythical community you 're supposed to come from -- fort wayne ' ?
it 's okay . look , hallie , i 'll meet you outside .
hold on a tick , let me put on my togs .
what kind of seats can we have ?
you see , when you travel , everything is small , self-contained --
you sure ?
... i get these people to trust you -- they 're coming here tomorrow by the way -- i get this expert doctor to talk to you . i 'm doing all your fuckin ' legwork -- and it 's eighteen months . you 're 'sposed to be in court . i bet you have n't even seen the file .
aw , it ai n't crap ... it 's ... cute . ... and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can mona lisa ?
but you do n't have a choice anymore . you 've become a significant threat to the national security structure . they would 've killed you already , but you got a lot of light on you . instead , they 're gon na destroy your credibility ; they already have in many circles in this town . you 're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks . be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case , something , anything , make arrests , stir the shitstorm . you got ta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack . remember , fundamentally people are suckers for the truth , and the truth is on your side , 'bubba . i hope you get a break ...
all of them do . we 'll kill twelve birds with one bomb . and we 'll be rich .
five o'clock . killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut .
admiral , i am receiving whale songs .
you know what he 's really upset about ?
lafayette is my friend ! he believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind ; so , of course he 's a child . but he would have died before he would have let me down .
right .
you will survive this ... donald . i promise you that you will survive . you must let me help you . and when i clap my hands together , you will wake up .
why now , jimmy ?
mind , now ! keep don quixote out of here !
same as last time -- the rest after .
oh , and what did you do ?
she never proved anything , not a thing !
no , i 'm warning you ! who do you think you are , god ? you bumble around with your folders ... ... and your pencils ... ... and your god-damn buttons ... ... all your badges of authority ! but you have no authority ! you 're nothing ! you 're a zero !
take it off .
what the crap ?
i do n't think so . but it 's a fascinating subject . did you ...
i thought it was important for you to know the facts .
well .
`` leo . the stages of the moon are in alignment , so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement . wash yourself more carefully each morning , stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment , and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear . ''

nope . no complaints .
definitely the most important guy in this room .
i 'm not at the top of the empire state building . i 'm here .
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy .
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
i could . of course i could . but no one would be like you ... i 'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted , how you can treat me this way , discarding me like --
the hell with this . i 'm goin , downstairs to get me a drink . you want somethin ' ?
they checked in .
claude .
like gangbusters , doc . okay , i missed the last one .
all this because of that whore !
he 's very pale . covered with scars .
they went that way .
like moths around the candle of the age . decadent , useless . they ca n't reflect anything . but you do . you reflect its broken heart .
no , not that way . broadneck and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly . it makes them queasy ... do you have any photographs of mr. merrick ?
mm . i enjoyed the ride . sorry you did n't .
home is important to a man .
i was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932 .
i could n't do it .

this kid 's ready but we wo n't know all the damage till we get in and see what 's happened . what have you got ?
i do n't mind now anyway . you know , up here in heaven , it 's beautiful . way better than fuckin ' hawaii or any place like that .

i do n't think so .
yes .
well , sometimes they 're not completely covered but ... they do n't freeze .
liquid oxygen canisters inside . start ripping them out . quick hits only -- try to make it last .

sounds like you got a crisis syndrome . are n't you exaggerating a bit , dick ? call it three-and-a-half , maybe four ...
you sure it belongs to his wife ?
and what do you propose , professor ? shall we hold a seminar to study the problem ?
you listen to me . the only reason i 'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar --
you did all right dad .
inland .
me ? oh , i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier . i see thousands of marching men . i see general lee with a broken heart , surrendering , and i can see the beginning of a new nation , like abraham lincoln said . and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president ? things like that can only happen in a country like america .
listen 棗
you could n't have a problem , chick , because i personally have got them all . i cornered the whole goddamn market . you would n't believe ... oh , how ya doin ' ... ?
hey , is n't that tran vo ?
yes . they would invade us using only ground tactics . hand to hand combat . they would n't use their technology or fight an airborne battle , because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them .
yeah -- that 's right . diz --
david ! david ! i ca n't believe this !
come here . feel this .
well , a rough estimate ... i 'd say fifteen .
plenty more . and somewhere up there 's the lode , the rock rotten with it .

a casa de porfirio zayas . he used to be a doctor on the other side . gunshot wounds , fixing babies -- if you can pay he can handle it .
i have waited for you , my son , for a long time . i have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers . i have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that i might find you . my friend , it is not an arduous task that i bequeath , for our order knows only silken bonds . to be gentle and patient , to care for the riches of the mind , to preside in wisdom , while the storm rages without .
bye , birdie . chip , honey ... i know it 's hard being a teenager but i understand ... i 'm your mother and i love you .

why ?
uh huh . well , thanks for the thought , but , as shocking as this may sound , i 'm not the first writer to sip a little weed . and furthermore , it might interest you to know that one book i wrote , as you say , 'under the influence , ' happened to win a little something called the pen award which , by the way , i accepted 'under the influence . '

because i am holding all the western territories hostage , mr. west ! a town a day will disappear ! willard was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , i level all of albuquerque ! yes , that 's right . only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own president will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire !

you 're amazingly self-assured . has anyone ever told you that ?
so are you . i mean you 're a neat guy . we better get back .
well . i 'd love to see that , but after taking counsel with my captains , i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city , then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything .
not only has he refused to fall , but he has beaten the champion 's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest .
plans ?
jack ...
yeah , that 's right .

you still do n't believe me , do you ?
what if i were to say `` your wife '' -- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel ?
who ?
... everybody wants the job . no one wants the authority . except hendricks . fine . he can go out there in that precious boat , and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me . call me in new york ... tell him to kiss my ass ... .
you 're beautiful .

hey , he 's your roommate .
what kind of signal ?
well , yes , but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend .

you believe that ? yeah , well , i guess you have to trust him . i 'd have second thoughts on that , but then i know 'em .
i mean , who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit . goldwater put it right . he said : `` well for christ 's sake , everybody bugs everybody else ; we know that . '' ... it 's the cover-up , not the deed that 's really bad here . if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it ; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they wo n't come back for the main course . that 's the tragedy of all this . mitchell 's going to get it in the neck anyway . it 's time he assumed some responsibility .
raoul , no ... you can not do this . no matter how your heart is broken --
it is so hot in here .
hello , frank .
i 'm sorry about what i said before .

the mamma 's there too .
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethel 's brother or something . his name is mercutio .
nobody , doctor .
that 's the god 's truth . and it gets me depressed . i swear that it does . at my age . to see a goddamn : `` somebody wins the cadillac this month . p.s . two guys get fucked . ''
i 've got what i want . turn around baby , look at me . look at your man .
mr. quaid , can you hear yourself ? `` she 's real because you dreamed her ? ''
i like it .
bastard .
with wings . you transport me , you know that ? you carry me away .
and what about screaming ?
who sent you to greece ?

that 's none of your business .
huh ?
i thought you already left .
we had about a dozen wets come over just upriver . they ran into one of our posts -- it was like a breakshot on a pool table , illegals runnin ' every which way .

i 'll take a ride .
why 'd you stay behind ? !
yes , everything they 've got . how are the passengers doing ?
it does ?
you do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came ?
yeah .
well , iris , i look at it this way . a lot of girls come into my cab , some of them very beautiful . and i figure all day long men have been after them : trying to touch them , talk to them , ask them out . and they hate it . so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all . so i do n't say a thing . i pretend i 'm not even there . i figure they 'll understand that and appreciate me for it .
and if you 're wrong ?
i do n't know . for me , i 'm saying , what is is , it 's probably not the orgasm . some broads , forearms on your neck , something her eyes did . there was a sound she made ... or , me , lying , in the , i 'll tell you : me lying in bed ; the next day she brought me caf ? au lait . she gives me a cigarette , my balls feel like concrete . eh ? what i 'm saying , what is our life ? it 's looking forward or it 's looking back . and that 's our life . that 's it . where is the moment ? and what is it that we 're afraid of ? loss . what else ? the bank closes . we get sick , my wife died on a plane , the stock market collapsed ... the house burnt down ... what of these happen ... ? none on 'em . we worry anyway . what does this mean ? i 'm not secure . how can i be secure ? through amassing wealth beyond all measure ? no . and what 's beyond all measure ? that 's a sickness . that 's a trap . there is no measure . only greed . how can we act ?
but ... they wo n't get all of us ... we 'll ... it 's too small ... there 's four hundred thousand of us in warsaw !

mister laplante ... bernie ... i ... just for a few moments ... i want to be a human being , not a reporter . i 'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and i looked up , and some man came out of the smoke , his face smeared with mud , and soot and ... and he ... saved my ... life . off the record . was it you ? why would you deny it if it was ? because you took my purse ? why ?

i 'm sorry what i said back there .
you want me to solve all your problems tonight ... ?
what do you think ?
all right , but remember , if you damage the fuhrer 's reputation , i kill you .
what did they say ?
you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose . or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter ?
something my dad -- they -- said . 'after all the suffering , after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other . ' the one thing that makes it bearable is love .

me , i 'm proud to be a jew , i got no problem . you do n't like it , fuck you . but with these guys it 's like a dirty word . all they wan na be is good red- white-and-blue americans , and the way they see it you ca n't be a good american and a jew . so sam goldfish becomes sam goldwyn and david selznick becomes david 0. selznick -- like anyone 's gon na think he 's irish for fuck 's sake --
it was illegal , what he did .
they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready .
veronica ... i ... it 's not like that anymore ... i mean , it was never really like that ...

agatha , you 're never going back there .
i ca n't describe it . i think it 's from the loam in the soil . this very rich , earthy kind of ... alive ... no . no , that 's not right . can you smell it ?
ah , i see . a purely ... plutonic relationship .
get the hell off of me !
immigration 's gon na love you for that .
well --
i 'd cut it ...
no .
why did you change your mind about bringing us along ?
exactly . happy birthday .
no offense , but you 're pretty out of it now .
that 's too easy . one minute you want to die , the next you want to live ... do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you do n't want it anymore ?
i know that . i 'm warped ... i 'm warped !
did you ever see a dolphin ?
listen to me .
wo n't you please join our club ? please ?

i 'd like to make a swap .
heh-heh .
do you want to be questioned about you and mr. jimmy ? please , clayton . it will be better if i find the body alone .
i beg your pardon . . . ? some gratitude .
hi ...
i call this the staccato .
last night , after you 'd gone , i did a little bit of asking around . seeing as you were n't very forthcoming , it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother ? i got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back , you know my life . machines . the arcades . nice business . looks after itself . people put money in . i take it out . not much rough stuff . it 's a business that makes me very happy . but recently , i 've had a spot of bother , one of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that 's already got some . the upshot is i 've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs . so far as i 'm concerned , that 's it . apparently not . these people i 've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit , so i 'm worried . i ca n't fight them ? i have n't that kind of set-up . but i 've got to fix them before they fix me . trouble is , if i try and they find out , i 'm dead .
thank you , sir . we hear back from the pentagon ?
i do n't want to talk about it here , brad .
alex , you do n't know how long i 've waited for this .
he does n't make sense to me either , chewie .
a thousand .
just put it in my room
yeah , that 'll work ... what the hell was he doing here ?
you know somebody around here ?
you 're the only one missing a grenade .
yeah , heh heh . umm , is n't seattle in washington ? heh heh ... 'cuz i was thinking maybe we could go see hole .
what 's that to miss ?
i did n't even know about it .
i think in some weird analytical , psychological bullshit way i 'm scared i 'm gon na turn out just like her , you know ? like the bad seed or something ...
i 've got to make a stop in vegas , then i 'm heading to santa barbara .
mm . but ya think he 's all right ? saw him last night and he 's -
but ...

that 's what i would have done .

you 're sick .

jewels are precious . goodbye , mr. hockley .
hush , claudia , hush now my dear -

and you know they 're gon na have some people watching the hotel .
ohhh ! you sunk it !
maybe i can help . let 's see ... if one night i got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note , and stayed away for months , i think what i 'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason .
no .
all i want to know is the where and the when . spare me mini moves , progress reports and bullshit .

i 'm very happy .
listen , i have no time for this . i 've heard this shit before ! so lets get on with it !

gentlemen , i did n't call you here at such an hour to make accusations , i just want to explore the possibilities . now , i have three questions ; is the man a foreign agent ? or , have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient ? or , thirdly , have the man 's files been destroyed ? now , i 'd like some answers .

the purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much ... food ... as possible . the purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side . the fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit , not the primary goal . the primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper . keep them fed and they behave . keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been . you saw them in there .
we 're gon na get caught . i know we 're gon na get caught . they were eyeballing my car .
there 's no procedure for that until she 's been arrested .
buddy , i have to ask you , as bad as i 've been please have pity on me and do n't ruin me by telling them what i did . i know it was bad , it was bad and dumb . but mostly it was dumb , i did n't mean you no harm , i 'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that 's the truth . i love you . but they 'd think i did , they 'd think i was awful , they 'd despise me and hate me ...
take it , damn it .
she will not be murdered . on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves ' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .
for what ?
where have you been these many years ? is it true that morgana --
a little more was taken out before . my brother 's a director of that bank , mr. mccoy ... i had a few pressing debts .
what does he want ?
pritchett , you 're not joining this necktie party ?
a lot of my friends are doing federal service ...
your mother .

well , you 're pretty close . it 's only about two miles from here .
do n't stand in the way of my actualization as a man , craig .
oh jesus .

you must be igor .
i would n't mind another b.e.e.r .
it 's almost there . the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time .
where is it ?
no . you 're right . he could have been something more . maybe a lot more . but people get lost . even good people . too much fame . too much money ,
were you scared up there ?
hell no ! i 'm rolling . i 'm a businessman . i 'm the man what < u > am < /u > . < u > beee < /u > tel < u > jooose < /u > ! < u > who < /u > do i got ta kill ?

cobb 's cut ... it was in him ! it got doc ...

i came to visit you .
stephanie loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough . we had a ball for years - we could do anything , anywhere , anyhow ... and we did ... we would play games - she would be the executioner and i would be the convict - she would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me ...
it抯 not the pin your father wore . it抯 an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
as far as crew , i was hoping ben could pilot the mission --
i want you to help me help my husband . i know he 's in some kind of trouble . and it 's something to do with the man you saw murdered .
j.r. , glad you could make it .

`` bob '' ? bob ! bob bob bob . bob what ?
yes ?
all right ! now , supposing a certain unmentionable worm , whose initials are d. b. , was trying to use that to shove his way into the white house . so he could put the screws on , so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses . what would you say about that ? huh ?
i know him .
what does it look like i 'm doing ? i 'm editing .

yes , sweetheart ... all by ourselves .
he 's sick ?
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6 , which must have been a spare .
i ai n't sleepy .
i am quaid .
hey - why do you have this ?
he implied it .
hell no ! ! ! that 's the last thing we need ... a buncha cops runnin ' around .
like the car . he hangs out with skank . that little ass-hair , and they hang at the pit -- hell , funboy lives there . ask top dollar .
the senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered !
we 'll just make an appointment for you at seattle junior college .
your compassion is overwhelming , doctor .
i wo n't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot 's throat .
you 're a stupid , fat arsed , obstructive , fascist moron are n't you ?
all right .
we need more bread and some baked lasa -- uh , lasagne . hi .
i 've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers ... do you know what it 's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach ... ? to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-. ? i did not choose to be such as this ! suzanne brought me here . she called to me !
i tell you , i could fly around this room with my eyes closed !
ahh ... my wife 's .
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you .
i do n't know .
friedman抯 dead ... they killed him ...
amen boy scout , now answer the fucking door !
not very chatty .
why ca n't i just do whatever i want to do ? why ca n't i just go wild ? ! yahoo !
you told me to look , so i looked .
well , it 's probably just the caretaker , and that 's exactly who we want to find . they 'll have a telephone . c'mon .
jason bourne is dead .
i need help , audrey .
asshole .
hard to believe . you shoot up one little town in oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun ... one little dogpatch town ... and everybody figures your wrapper 's broken . no sense of humor . what did you expect ? an engraved plague from the chamber of commerce ?
his mother 's dead , and he has n't seen his father in twelve years .
i want taupin .
mama ! mama ! miss boatwright , say she gon ' help me find where daddy is !
no . they 're firing even more people than they said . some will want to talk . it could help .
nuts . we got a big meeting in vegas coming up . and we 're kinda just gettin ready for that right now .

they 're like beasts . wild .
in all these years ... why could n't i see how it wold turn out ?
is it a what ?
come off it , peggy . and what do you mean your house ? this is my house . i paid for it , i 'm still paying for it .
what brought this on ?
-- i do n't want your trophy and i do n't give a shit about it ! 'cause i knew you when ! ! you and jack and tom sanders . i knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and did n't know what side of the bed to piss on !
he 's close ...
because ... there was no way to win .
then why did they try and sneak in the back door ? tell me that . why did n't they contact us first and say ...
the match !
i 've got the photographs in my office . if they 'll help you remember . what was the argument about ?
or did you steal it from your old friend renard ?
sure . never come back . disappear forever .
< u > listen < /u > .
medallions .
we pretend ...
i do n't want to talk about it .
you know what , i 'm just gon na crash .
i did n't do it , he did it himself . something about a wife and kid . the fact is , he 's lost it . he knows it . i know it . you were up there , you know it , too . goose give him a break , skipper . it was raining snakes up there . he 'll be alright , soon as all the gorillas go home ...
what 's happenin ' ?
if you went away , what would become of me ?
i do n't understand .
< i > got ta strip/ got ta give some lip/ got ta make my tip/ but keep yo hands to yourself - cuz you ai n't touching these tits. < /i >

my shoes .
i 'll be your best friend .
you know , they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they抮e naked .
i do n't know .
ferrari 's , lamborghini 's ... high end pasta rockets . ten to start .
i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --
do n't be sorry for me . i did those things . no one else did . i 'm dealing with that .
so , anyone talk to janelle ?
bullshit ! i 'll go postal in this mothafucka !
i 'm not blubbering .
you remember that pizza place , joe 's on tenth street maybe fifteen years ago ? when you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle ?
sorry about ...
it would be so okay .
i 'm just curious . ca n't you give me an example ?
over the line , smokey ! i 'm sorry . that 's a foul .
that i 'm a freak .
war-mongering bully ! do n't think you 're going to intimidate me !
the place produces nothing . i should n't say that - nothing it produces reaches the army . that 's not all right .
no , i like the car . by the way , though , about prom ? that was like a bad idea . sorry i invited you .
fuzzy face is gone .
she 's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker .
because i just saw johnnie downstairs .
all right , i 'll go in there for dorothy -- wicked witch or no wicked witch -- guards or no guards -- i 'll tear 'em apart . i may not come out alive , but i 'm going in there . there 's only one thing i want you fellows to do .
she was there , alone , sir , she was in a burning building , waiting for your folks to come through the wall . and ...
you live with it ... and they haunt you . it does n't leave .
... but as i began to investigate , i realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher ...
from the data - and from that picture the air force took earlier tonight ... ... what we 've got in the gully out there is a guide ship . one lands ... others follow later . they appear to clear an area , then drop in groups of threes , joined magnetically . is that possible ?
i should shit or get off the pot .
he 's better off this way .
great . sit down . oh these marvellous doughnuts , help yourself . coffee will be ready in a few minutes .
quit kidding ! it 's all over the front pages , you know , i 've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry king westley .
out ?
you sent my assistant on an errand .
go to sleep -- i 'll see you in the morning .
then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over .
gladly , caesar . and , if you 'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light .
no . the generator . you got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen . get to it . where 's the damn flashlight ? you fellas okay over there ?
father , i saw a post rider at the house .
... we did everything we could ...
what ? you would n't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter ? cone on . she bought the same story we did ...
i 'm listening .
will you listen to this man ? will you just listen to him ? you really caused a panic on a public beach , you shoot up the place , god knows who could 've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us ? that could ruin us .
bring 'em all . let 's move !
the trunk . it 's locked .
we 've fired on the chancellor 's ship -
mrs. bickerman , the reason we 're up here ... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake . do you know how your husband died ?
laura martin . this is will maddox , the primary negotiator --
you 're light a deuce .
i want to help you , will . you 'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself . we do n't invent our natures , they 're issued to us . along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else . why fight it ?
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you ...
luke , i 'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation . i 'll come to the point . i want to buy the property , and i 'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it . and that 's just for the property , mind you . if you want , i 'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has , and you keep those proceeds . i just want the land .
oh yeah , that 's it .
look at them ugly suckers , blue . one sheet of glass between them and us .
come , now . you just got here .
i do n't trust anybody .
first , you 're a slob . you have to dress for success . second , your outlook on life ...
what do you mean ?
go on foot .
the airport ... no , look out , short round ! left , left !
who ... are you ?
it 's from the machine . all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already . we ca n't let that happen .
good . it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife . sexual problems upsetting to the child .
pretty country .
yes , but by what standard , ask i ? forget your old measures . unlearn , heh , unlearn .
how do i contact you ? we still do n't have the atm info .
and please , do n't for god 's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
must i speak to you in french ?
ten gees .
oh , yes ! it may need some slight alterations , but it is madam 's size . all right , dear . we 'll have it for you to try in a moment .
you are young . you do n't understand the attraction of great power , and you forget the pain of long waiting .
stopped they must be . do you hear ? on this all depends .
so . i wo n't be seeing her ? your clients usually visit me after the settlement .
carl , what are you doing ?
otis !
too young or too old ?
what d'ya mean ?
you do n't need anybody .
you mean you ai n't coming with emmett and me ?
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with george bailey .
all right , why ?
just wanted to see for myself . they 're burning their documents .
maybe it is . i would n't know .
go back to them first . then you can decide about lo .
at the roulette table , trying to win enough for our exit visa . well of course , he 's losing .
it was a honest mistake , sir .
i would think so .
what 's all this for , more security ?
let 's go . everybody take off ?
i 'm not too short to be cagney .
well , it 's over between you and him . we 're getting married next month .
where are we going ?
what do i exude ?
as you can see , this is just a simple microcassette recorder . hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters .
yeah , that 's a good idea , turkle . why do n't ya take rose on a little tour of our facilities ...
rules are made to be broken .
have the planes made it to china ?
well , for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years ...
how 'd what go ?
she 's the sweetest person i 've ever known . loves kids . works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church . everybody loves her .
how ? by taking my money ?
no . i just have short hair .
that 's weird . i talked to your brother jimmy five or six times .
oh , adam . we 're home . in our own house . nonsense . i 'll make some coffee . you get some more firewood .
maybe you should get married . pick one of your cousins , it would demonstrate a profound stability .
fuck you .
second cousin , three times removed . now get off me !
go now . quell was wise . he knew that a man can not ask more of his death than it help his friends .
china . what happened ? china shhh . it 's ok. i missed you so much .
jesus !
whoever took it does .
it 's a fake .
well , what about artificial insemination ?
bonjour ? monsieur ? allo ...
plan ?
it 's still back there !
it does n't matter .
positive ?
fantastic ! that you could figure all that out , and lay that down on her , to come up with a way you could get your toast .
for dana , schmuck . bring your kid something . you know . the dad thing .
c'mere .
what , sergeant ?
and the child who did die ?
second thing that comes to your mind .
i know , this is fucking nuts .
if you think we 're going to have some kind of 'life affirming ' romance here just because we cheated death , let me be clear : we 're going to have it where i want , and when i want .
i miss them , too .
i do n't doubt that the queen was highly amused . she has always had a very healthy sense of humor .
so what do i tell this guy ?
are you going to take her with you ?
motherfucker ...
screwball ! you dolt ! i 've a mind to change you into a toad .
oh look , it 's doob ! will you excuse me a minute , tucker ?
love you too .
at first .
she wants to see what you can do .
chino 's gon na wan na talk to me .
you did ? was it anyone that you ... ?
the extortion , the threats ...
why are we going to do that ?
-- just that a lot of reports were sent to creep , but he does n't name who , not here anyway --
eleven o'clock !
-- bernstein , are you sure on this story ?
yes . they 've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars , and there 's only one way to spot a fake .
i 'll get you some quick work --
your father and i were very close . of course jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing and i keep his name alive at the office every day .
or maybe ... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? maybe that 's why we spend so much time together .
... i understand ...
marlon --
oh , she is n't really your wife . how stupid of me ... she was hauser 's wife .
so , it 's not a winning record .
sorry .
i 've read it ; i 'm pleased that the government is doing so well . as a heavy investor , i 'm pleased . how did the doctor find you ?
i 'm sure he 'll forgive you .
why ? is it because of your white gal ? folks say you 're running around town with her .
what the hell 's going on ?
you are more beautiful than any of them .
for two years , i 've been tracking the mayflowers ' peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces . their sforza replica was as fake as the `` gas leak '' that supposedly destroyed it .
look at its insides .
that 's carlotta valdes .
a quarter of a million , jimmy .
you want it coming back with us ?
are you disrespecting this court , mr. white ?
what happened ? that needle sank like a rock .
go , go , go , jump !
that 's right .
so can i ?
a funeral .
that porter was gray and the gentleman of consequence who could n't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire gray --
well done , sire !
it 's that kind of selfish attitude that ...
no way . there 's no way i 'm giving that money back . it 's my money now .
that is correct , sir . and then all i can think about is like trying to snuff it .
no , sir . i have n't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i 've been back ...
that is n't a waiter , my dear . that 's a butler .
you better hold onto your tongue !
well , that 's the signature -- and above , it says 'dear rufus -- you belong in jail . '
what do you mean tip the cops ? is the man a lunatic or what ?
let the girl go .
count 'em on one hand .
i 'm sure glad you found us , sebastian . what do you think , mary ?
he was n't there .
prairie ? oysters ?
what happened to your money ?
yeah .
but if she dies ...
see , now we 've got a plan .
i 'm fine dad .
it 's simple , stu . we need nightmares - lots of 'em . so whenever we can swing it , we send a guy up to stimulate the flow ... a < u > nightmare maker < /u > ! like steve here . poe . rasputin ... we 've been doing this all the way back to atilla and genghis khan !
fair enough .
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed . fuck this ship .
you love emily . i know that . and you need to stay with her .
good morning , liz .
i am .
no puedo ver la orilla ! [ i ca n't see the bank ! ]
this book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon .
you .
leon抯 not found , your parents worry , talk of hiring help to find him , even mention their manhunter friends perhaps ... and adonis panics , takes control , brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward , not before leon抯 found anyhow . he must have kicked himself when he learned i抎 exceeded his expectations .
you believe that ?
they 're all a bunch of phonies .
do n't mention that word around here . you 'll get them excited .
he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom , said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all .
some , i guess , but mos'ly cow bones .
why did she have to show up now ?
-- can we use their names ? --
yes .
let me take a look at that map .
jesus christ .
it is ended .
yes . it 's perfect , is n't it ?
so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?
you have no idea what a perimeter is , do you ?
no navicom . a lot of good you are now , epps .
this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again !
and nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but i felt it stirring inside me , this -- this wild , pagan feeling --
doctor .
what 's that to you ?
you 're the one always turning your nose up at me .
maybe she does n't need any . should we check ?
why do n't you say , no system is perfect .
would n't bet against her . tell you what i will do -- bet you i find that bracelet before we hit france . not a hundred , though -- just fifty .
what if i did ?
for what ?
absolutely .
goddamn it . i got ta have some kinda life !
hey , i got some great stuff ... it 's okay .
well ... annie for one .

hmm , how about tomorrow night ?
i 'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight . i wanted to see some life in the raw .

charlie really has a great voice .
there 's no such thing .
no , wait , it just goes ... `` he said he liked to do- '' ...
the cops did n't try and strangle my ass .
when you put your mouth to his , susan , it seems a frequent thing .
ohh no , it makes my skin creep !
no , i did n't write it , but ?
sorry .
john , we have nothing to talk about .
a man might what ?
oh , remember that time i got my training bra and you --
is it all right about mrs buttle 's cheque ?
would you stop with that ...
tell him i want to give him his money .
i 'm sorry , sir , but i must insist .
that your cousin is more to your taste .
did you know that guy who disappeared ? did n't he work at pierce & pierce , too ? was he a friend of yours ?
... come on , skipper , i already put my shoes on ...
i can make wishes like this come true . i 'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself ? tell the truth --
got to think this through ...
your intentions are noble , but no diesel fuel for heat . no coolants to preserve food . millions would die of cold and hunger alone .
i know , my bedside manner 's horrendous .
keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
i left them here . i was doing some work here .
good mornin ' , nathan .
where are you going ?
what ? !
how long will the effect last ?
one hour !
they 're for my bodyguard . i have an absolute conviction that arnold is planning to have me assassinated ! it will be harder if i am surrounded by a body of men who look like me , do n't you think ?
i think treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government .
oh , no , no . i am not a highwayman , i 'm just a nuisance . all i 'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible .
stands on the edge of the woods , almost in a trance .
you are cattivo , court composer . i want to meet this young man . chamberlain , arrange a pleasant welcome for him .
it 's all right . i 'm simply in shock ... this is what happens to people when they experience events they ca n't understand or comprehend . the mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it 's been exposed to . i 'm going to need a lot of therapy .
george ! what are you doing here ?
surprised ?
schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along .
i want to know what in hell you 're doing .
we all had to write a last letter home .
making it with my mother ?
no . his office . i want a very private conversation . i do n't want to be bugged .
we do n't need your help we 're doing great on our own .
let 's do that .
you coming tonight ?
she 's never written a book in it , but she clearly knew a lot .
okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you , martin ?
i hate innocent bystanders . whine , whine , whine . will he settle ?
well ... what the fuck , man ?
better now , son ?
how ?
still working on being the first girl in the nba ?
shoulda written , rudy ...
and that 's where you 're not being clever . he would n't parade his crime in front of the open shades .
better cut that out . that 's what happens to girls who bite their nails . what 's wrong ?
the chief justice ? what on earth for ?
it must be the altitude 棗 you , bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot梐nd梥addle boys --
you sure are hung up on people bein ' sweet . speakin ' of which , where 's your girlfriend ? i thought he was comin ' by here for something .
look ... can we deal with this tomorrow ... i 'm tired ...
why did n't you bury those people ?

you should look into private schools .
i see an old man , set in his ways , afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do . i see the man i will never be .
i always have , claire..
i 'm telling you , nick , no one 's going to come .
hello ?
thank-you ...
well , she ...
well , he ai n't gon na be around no more .

i 'm not rheya . you 've always known that .
good evening , ninotchka .
well , sure . but he was super-gentle , you know ? i mean , he raped me and all , but i guess there 's all different kinds of rapes . i did n't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started , it did n't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick , and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin ' my sandwich .
you 're gon na be me . you 're gon na go in , and you 're gon na get the info on the remaining two hits .
he 's got a gun ! !

i just happen to know it . i had a nightmare and i screamed for you . you were n't here . where were you ?
look at this guy .
what'the fuck is that ?
datura metel . the devil 's trumpet . do n't worry . i ai n't goin ' religioso again . it 's a flower that grows on these islands . where i come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a mickey finn . it 's toxic . ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it ... or ... in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system .
i told you . nothing --
there was an accident . a fucking car accident . all of a sudden . boom . jesus , someone 's going to make a believer out of me .
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance ... she ...

women talk too much . to tell a woman not to talk is like telling jesse james not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle . and samson , the strongest man that ever lived , was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms .
it 's not fair to you . this whole --

the day tom jefferson frees a slave i 'll ride naked through the streets of williamsburg on a mule . tom jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small . the only man out there who really does what he says is sam adams and everyone thinks he 's crazy . believe me , this 'disturbance ' is n't going to last long . you have to understand , congress is a chicken coop full of foxes , martha , each and every one has his eye on a nice , fat prize .
i guess you do n't get bothered by neighbors much .

neither .
just my luck .

no ... not in the eyes of the police .
i swear to god !
now , aim --

yeah , right ...
from what i 've seen , mr. galvin , you have a very good case ...

so i guess you could say that we screwed up , but we were n't wrong .
do n't puss out .
crying ? why was she crying ?
no . open the door .
there it is again . that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place . that `` make a statement , '' do an end zone dance , shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that 's dragging this whole country down the drain . they do n't owe us shit , wesley ! when you finish the job , you get paid ! ! we have n't finished the goddamn job ! !
take it up !
sometimes when i 'm lonely .
yeah ... i knew it . but , what choice do i have ? i 'm in the hospital ; they drag me out of the hospital ... bring me down here ...
i like the way you think .
you want me to leave ?
yes , i do . that way there 's no misunderstandings . i need to make sure no one 's hurt , then we can take care of business .
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident . we try to remember we 're a military organization .
i do n't give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there 's only one way to do that .
somebody told me nathan was back . how is he ?

we do n't know you 're a werewolf . it might never happen again . you have to get on with your life .
good man . good pirate . and clever -- i never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him . when you were puzzling out that cell door , it was like seeing his twin .

we held a mirror up to the doctor , and -- apparently -- he did n't like what he saw .
-- it has n't been two years --
now wait . we all had the same option as blake . it was work for the government or do time .
i do n't mind him ... but i do think it 's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup .

you 're not a liar . or you 're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..
'cause it 's fun . it do n't matter if you ai n't no good . it takes your mind off of everything else while you 're doin ' it . when you run real fast tryin ' to make a touchdown you do n't think about anything else . i ai n't no good , but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it . did you have any brothers and sisters growin ' up to play with ?
it 's broke i guess . there 's an electric in the bedroom .

it 's my nature .
i think there are sixteen there .
can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry , the electric dishwasher , the garbage disposal and a nagging wife .
you 'll be there to see it ; you 'll be there .
i already knew . knew beforehand . when was it supposed to have happened ? -- two o'clock in the morning , eddie said .

your nose ring comes out of your nose . if you 've got them in your nipples , they come out , too . and there 's no make-up at my house . no glue sniffing . huffing . no pills , no grass .

well , that 's what i said , is n't it ?
missoula 's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle . i told you mason was walking shit .
how 'd you get that .
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest . surely this is not how you repay their gratitude , kal-el . could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream .
it 's healer to killer . is that the same thing ?
how was dive class ?
my father .
so ? what 'd you do to her ?
why ?
bela , somebody misplaced the motor . so when you wrestle the octopus , shake the legs a bit , to make it look like it 's killing you .
oh -- now let 's talk like adults . you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do . we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it would n't sound so good . when you first approached us ...
may i ask why ... ?
hello , exposition .
left phoenix under her own steam ?
hey !
well , let me put it this way . most of the cost is due to safety reasons . most people are not familiar with space travel , so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless .
for yuh .
a bodyguard ... who 's the guy ?
too many pizzerias already there .
they ca n't pull this on me . it is n't fair -- i do n't believe this --
yep . right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles . the bucks are right behind them and we 're right behind the bucks . this gun gets fired before ten o'clock . whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you . i 'll put you inside 30 , 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season . that 's what you 're paying me for , ai n't it ?
and here 's sandro . why do n't you two go upstairs and change ?
baby , i 'm anybody you want me to be . i 'm a little schoolgirl , i 'm mommy , i 'm a czech girl .
you go ahead ...
ok toots , i will .
is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york , to assume and consolidate your nefarious power ?
i like him , mom .
and how much will your `` fun '' net you this time ?
i do n't expeck we can las ' much longer -- some a the folks ai n't et for two days . you goin ' back tonight ?
until you , or anyone else ...

i 've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months . soak the prison off me .
how can you bring that up at a time like this ?
but he 's a policeman --
they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta .
mm . mm . now these eggs got some kick to it . what'chu got in this ?
oh ... it 's ... er ... the guys from the beer convention . we 're bringing them to the party .
that 's cause we 're below sea level .
i 'll withdraw it . mr. beckett ? were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater ?
never mind , strudel . it 's part of music , getting used to an audience . are n't i right , herr mozart ?
i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?
tu
when do i get to meet him ?
it has to be done .
for the third time , yes .
i 'm sorry , jenny . i am .

do n't !
... which i did not get .
i love you .
why do you do these stupid things ? !
let me speak to max cherry .
south dakota north .
oh !
even if you graduate this academy , you 've still got nine months of probation . that 's hard duty , son . if you do n't really love this job , it 'll kill you .
i do n't know what to say
those are my letters !
are you coming ... ?
honey , you know what i 've been like lately ... i 've been a total zombie . i have no idea what that was doing in my pocket .
the body is a holy repository .
but that 's cheating !
mozart is writing a new opera . an italian opera .
because i can deliver the actual noc list . the one you have is not only worthless , it 's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location .
from carl heine 's boat . all his were like this one , three-strand manila , new condition , braided in loops . not bowlined like miyamoto 's .
thank you . what is going to happen tomorrow ? exactly ?
belle .
-- yes , yes , what is it ?
sorry .
hello , peter .
we 're like his handlers . he ca n't function without us .
and you 're looking for ?
i 've always liked the format of rowan and martin 's `` laugh-in . ''
i -- just wan na help bring these guys to justice . they 're neo-nazis .
and what did you do ?
i 've been looking for that flash and i look and i look and i ca n't find it . and what if i already had it ? you know . my moment ? what if it 's gone ? and i never saw it ? you 're getting married , man . that 's a fucking beautiful thing . just a beautiful thing . i just ca n't stop breaking beautiful things .
man , there 's too many garbage files , i need more time .
maybe you 're not aware of this , crow horse , but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods , psycholingusitics , dna fingerprinting ; i do n't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers . leo was killed right here .
oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits .
we moved out after that . upstate .
that right ? ... she used to be some looker .
turn around !
i know it as surely as you 're sitting here , sweetheart . she was the most vital woman i ever met .
son , would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom . my hand is too weak . and would you do me another favor ? i do n't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me ? i have trouble bending over .
i can trust rheya .
wan na be a part of history ?
what ? ! ?
i 'm overworked as it is . `` raban '' did you say ?
-- that 's what we call double-a grade lumber , ma'am ; you do n't find a knot in a thousand feet .
just do it !
i 'll do it if it takes every penny i 've got . i 'll do it if i have to bribe that musical comedy justice of the peace ! i 'll do it梚f i have to prove that you were dragged in , staggering drunk . you probably were . mmm梞mm . this filet mignon is divine !
you did ! !
if that means freeze my balls off , no thanks . i 'll be okay .
keep it .
i 'm losing my blood !
like your boyfriend . he 's kinda hot .
come f'r my rockin ' chai ' ... ole mose .
uhhh ... i have no idea what you just said .
negatory . < u > too many ants < /u > . and while we soldiers go out there , and fight , and bleed , and die for the colony , the namby-pamby workers live it up back home .
ow !
-- i do n't care who you are . you could 've been killed . every man and woman in here has done hard prison time . and we look out for each other .
sure .
not that i 'm aware .
that 's all right . if i think of something , i 'll send my butler over to tell you .
the reasons you wo n't let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description , and i 'm supposed to follow it , right ?
i 'm sure you understand .
what 's wrong ?
... you look wonderful ...
... so what 're you doing tonight ?
ed , i want confessions .
you are the guardian , willow . you must take her to tir asleen .
i 'm sorry ...

you need my help ... ? you need a goddamn keeper ... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand ? huh ... ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ?
to run late !
it - it feels like - like i 'm being filled up . crowded out of myself . like i 'm fading away-
i hate to be pragmatic , but they 'll sacrifice pawns before kings . it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff .
but ... how ?
yes . i lost a brother once . i was lucky . i got him back .
look , you seem like a nice guy , ed , but you 're just not my type . but keep in touch . let me know when your movie opens .
i 'm leaving .
aloha , spicoli .
it means `` happiness . ''
but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday .
has n't moved for twelve hours . go on . have a heart .
that 's the last time you rode , is n't it ? do you think it was your fault ? is that why ?
find fergie , check the barns . i 'll watch these two .

he 's setting me up to make a proposition .
i see `` hot cross buns , '' but okay .
no i am not .
and , waiter -- you see that moon ?
i 'll need a receipt for that . for all these .

i 'm directing .
what did you expect me to be - part of your ...
hey , ray , you ever been to the cotton club ?
must be mach two-five stuff . altitude fifteen thousand .
i guess he 's not going to show up - it 's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot ?
you said you do n't give a fuck and that 's the beauty of a breakdown ? this does n't look like not giving a fuck , you know that ?
oh , serious questions tonight . of course i love you .
peggy lee ?
you ca n't just take it !
yes , but only in the dream they call life .
what about the record ?
i found it ! i found it !
said what ?
yeah , what about when godzilla was coming ? you people were screaming your asses off .
hannah 's a smart , pretty woman , but she 's got a hard idea for living .
yeah vick ?
absolutely . no cheap thrills . a genuine journey to the brink of madness .
i thought you arrested me .
the energy shield is down . we 'll be stuck here forever .
oh , look what happened . oh god , i 'm so sorry . are you ok ?
i do n't think they 're ordinary . i love keychains .
are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin ' around in there with a pocket knife ?
i think we might .
... perfect ...
have you no feelings , woman ?
what is it ?
why does he call you that ?
that 's what i do n't understand -- why should it come here -- and why did n't it stay here ? it 's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt .
yeah , that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains . i hope he do n't mess things up .
oh yeah , ... i mean no . no ! i wo n't settle down ! not this time ! ...
man , i do n't want to go into this .
don ?
good . now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions . did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun ?
you will wait ?
uh , i 'll do my best , dad . do you have any advice at all for me ?
that 's right , you just stood there and watched , because you `` felt like it . '' almost makes you worse .
and if i did n't < u > know < /u > better - i 'd swear we were moving !
into the hudson ?
what about zero , darryl hawkins ?
can you be any more specific ?
no particular reason . just to go somewhere .
go ahead . take the jeep . i 'll come to cache with bob when he gets here .
i guess . you 're lucky you do n't have any old people around here .
where was you , daddy ?
what 's going on ?
if he wanted a photographic memory , he shoulda kidnapped one . i 'm working on it here .
so when was i here ?
the bottom line ... mr. cole ... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour .
um ... okay .
you broke your promise . you talked to her about me .
i am so glad to meet you . we are so glad to < u > have < /u > you here , and < u > welcome < /u > you to our ... i , you know , they had c ... i 'm , < u > yearly < /u > i redecorate our , to restore it to the , 1835 ...
well why do n't you take your pants off and stroke it for me ?
it 's cochrane .
like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the quick and split .
mr. garrison , you 're reaching . i am an international businessman . the trade mart which i founded is america 's commercial pipeline to latin america . i trade everywhere . i am accused , as are all businessmen , of all things . i somehow go about my business , make money , help society the best i can and try to promote free trade in this world .
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical .
a couple of hours .
with all she was doin ' . with all the shit she kept doing ! you stayed stuck to that bitch 's ass and you would n't let go .
yes .
back here . at the end of the block .
in the car .
what do you want ?
do n't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia . that 's all just ways of people justifying their own failure .
she was lonely , i talked to her . norman , i know how it looks , but --
i like hearing you talk . if you feel up to a short walk , there 's a place to eat around the corner . all the food in vegas is terrible so the place does n't really matter . how does that sound to you ?
it 's called a cascading bio- genic pulse . the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits . depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship ... or a planet .
baby , i 'll call you tomorrow .
as good as humanly possible .
do n't fuckin ' patronize me .
are you seeing somebody else , nathan ? i just have to know .
because i really suspect gideon -- and it is always the person you do n't suspect .
is everything alright ?
these four wagons must be his .
why do n't i escape , that 's what you were going to ask me , right ? 'cause i 'd be crazy to escape ! i 'm all taken care of , see ? i 've sent out word .
so what are ya drawin ' ?
why did you contact us ?
agent little weasel , federal bura of your imagination .
apparently your friend has gone into mexico . a border guard responded to the apb . how does it feel to have the l.a.p.d . doing your work for you ?
yeah ... cop hit me ...
very well . i 'm here now .
that 's right .
they do n't look happy ... something 's gone wrong .
i do n't know - it 's a big apartment . but i was n't interviewed . in fact , i was totally unprepared for what happened .
well , it was notarized , and witnessed by a mrs. lucy delaney . maybe you can ask her .
come on , at least try one . it took me two hours to make these .

i know i 'm better than what i 've been doing the last ten years , walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps , waiting till it 's time to scream .
strange , major . there was a firefight . shooting in all directions .
i can feel your pain .
do n't even start .
maybe i 'm going too fast .
loser . i ca n't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this . it 's quite an impressive virus . dade , i know how you might feel about narking on your friends , but , we 're hackers . for us , there 's no such thing as family and friends . we 're each our own country , with temporary allies and enemies . i 'd like to make a treaty with you .
for scaring you like i did . when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day ...
... what kind of man *are* you ?
i 'm thirty .
you know , i 'm assigned to this school . i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks . your attention is flattering , but not really productive . why do n't you keep your mind on flying .
... i just wanted to let you know that everything was all right . i took care of everything . now all we have to do is keep our heads .
there can never ... ever ... be anything physical between us . you know that , dear .
that was close ... .
do n't you hurt her !
what are you doing here , mama ?
you should go back to her .
come on , what were you going to say ?
but uncle al ! you said-

try not to look at the stars ... keep your eyes on the ship .
huh ? uh , yeah -- i 've got ta run . tell dwayne hi . maybe someday we can all get together .
another premonition ?
look at me like you haven抰 seen me every day for the last twelve years ...
it 's a long road that has no turning .
i love that you抮e asking questions , but do you really want to get into all of this ?
four fulls , one half . that mean we 're halfway there ? i hope ?
there are other ways to see . sit .
a puppet .
i tear off the cover and paste this one on ... you know how it is .
i like talking about it . at least , to you .
marie , just -- -- just stay there ! -- just --
look , i saw these guys , i can i.d . them .
yeah . that was me .
well , no , well , you could n't < u > tell < /u > any ...
i 'm going to be so happy to get to college . i hear at northwestern they do n't make fun of you for knowing the element table .
so you have had sex .
asteroids ! chewie , bank left , let 's find out where they 're coming from ...
i ca n't believe elliot and i ca n't think of someone nice for you to go out with , you know --
other ships , yes . but no experienced commanders . captain , i need jim kirk .
we vetoed that ?
maybe he 's got good taste ... i do n't think he 's spent much time with a woman like you ... .
mental instability ?
i want you to know right now that the trial 's going to be nasty . your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud . they 're going to say that you enticed marsh -- led him down a dark path .
jesus christ . i get in a good mood . how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood , and then be in a good mood ?
but mr. webster ... you 're doin ' okay with brazil and them other places . what 's wrong with just one little old country doin ' their own thing ?
mrs. lampert , any morning now you could wake up dead .
is it terribly erotic ?
what have you found out ?
he told us it 's in the buick .
i want you to leave . then maybe ...
you 're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves . the king of the shock jocks . i 'm , i 'm shocked .
you 're the animals - all of you !
well ? how 'd she do ?
why are you so aggressively unimaginative ? eduard is no longer the only casualty .
what are you talking about ?
what you wrote inspired me . _ 79 .
w-wait a minute , wait a minute .
you positive about that ? you were n't nervous and let something slip by mistake ? if you did , i ai n't mad , i just got ta know .
yes .
please . please do n't forgive me . i 've always hated you for that .
like you .
easy micheal .
what ?
yeah . come on梒ome on !
where were you ? on a ... uh , * mission ?
yeah .
it 's a 27b/6 , what did you think it was ?
your private train , sir .
there are two .
sometimes i can just feel the numbers .
wah ... ? where are ... ?
well , i 'm sure your father and i would love to hear what you 're playing these days . maybe after dinner .
it 's okay .
i am sorry you feel that way .
i did n't see nothin ' .
what does that mean ? what does he do ?
you use the word `` fucking . '' you 're sexualizing things . stop berating yourself . it 's okay to have sex .
if you do n't mind , perhaps i could pay you another visit sometime .
just find the girl .
what ?
we 're going back into the case , lou - the murder of the president . i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas - talk to some people . bill , i want you to get oser on the medical , the autopsy , susan on oswald and ruby histories , tax records ...
benjamin ?
the great communicator .
i know you 've been subtly spreading the word that i 'm having a breakdown .
you really think she 's been sent ... by god ?
where ?
all right , you remember the *man* then .
a through h is correct .
not money . but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution .
is he dead ?
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today .
whatta you mean , `` horrible ? ''
you 're welcome to try . there he is .
would you two like a cup of tea ?
i 'm no good .
i must be healthy , then , because i 'm scared to death . i guess i 'd better get back to yorgi .
do n't move !
read me what she said .
suit yourself . but do n't keep the boxes around here long .
excalibur ! is it true ?
i could use the walk .
that 's it ! up ahead !
the theatre ?
beats the hell outta me .
yeah , but he was successful .
a most courteous exposition .
but it 's not fair . i 'm half drunk and you 're not even --
no . i like this attic very much .
in what way ?
right .
is that what you were trained to do ?
soldier -- where '' s your c.o . ?
the late 20th century .

give me an example .
after this has opened , when everything 's settled down , you and i are going away . just the two of us . no dolphins , no sharks , no whales , no penguins . just you and me .
the probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one . on three machines in a row , it 's in the billions . it can not happen ... would not happen , you fuckin ' momo ! what 's the matter with you ! did n't you see you were bein ' set up on the second win ?
and now that he 's safe from all other women , you can go on loving him .
yes , because i know they 'll read it .
what do you want me to do for you , mr. stephens ?
girder , watch your head .
i mean i 'm a fucking fraud . i 'm no architect . do n't be a putz -- who 's been to santiago twice in a year ? estadio olimpico -- please !

it 's too late now . okay ? we 'll have to deal with these .
detective kincaid ?

no , no thanks . hey , don't-
speed ?
you have two murders to investigate . this man 's head was beaten in . and there 's nothing in his pockets .
and the wine - excellent .

ten-four , hon . this is for you .
so is dewey your real name ?

there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience . sometimes , in some cases . it 's necessary to take a risk . i got to thinking . i 'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman 's apartment . you know . sneak in and hide and observe .

you must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him . such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular ivy leaguer . turns out he is king farouk . mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins . a girl like you , for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup ? who needs it ! you listen to me , you find yourself a nice , substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what , for whom ? -- for some good time charlie ? sssh !
leave me alone -- !
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones .
what are you talking about ?
the other guy ?
roderick , you know well enough that i have never loved but you ! was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ? ever so angry , but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side ? did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you ? have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it ? no , i loved you too much and too fondly ; i have always loved you . from the first moment i saw you , i saw your bad qualities , and trembled at your violence ; but i could not help loving you . i married you , though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so , and in spite of reason and duty . what sacrifice do you want from me ? i am ready to make any , so you will but love me , or , if not , that at least , you will gently us me .

you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago . nobody cared a tinker 's cuss who slept with whom , so long as you kept it out of the papers . outside of hollywood , who knows who george cukor is , much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica ?
your foot ! give me your foot ! !
i do n't ski .

what could they do ? the guy that took the head was about six-seven , and maybe three-hundred pounds . he was packing two lugers , and the others had m-16s .
all right , take it easy now , take it easy .
how could you let this happen , general schmuck ?
a lotta people would n't have tried . it was pretty brave even trying ...
you run with your back to the picture . like you were trying to get away . once in awhile you sing along with music , but mostly you punish yourself .
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off , i go after him . the fuck you think i do ?
can you spare three hundred ? pay you back next month , promise .
yes .
pretty incredible , isn抰 it ?
that 's what i 'd like to know . if you see him on the street somewhere , tell him he 's fired .
she 's not dead !
adam --
walking out on the mob . what 's the big idea ?
i cut myself shaving .

roger de bris . roger de bris . oh yes , the director . is he good ... i mean bad ?
if you were in love with me , would you ?
but if the jews are strengthened by hate , would n't this `` destruction '' you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already ?
i tell you what . why do n't i read with her ?
well that 's what we 're here for . i mean -

riker here .
any time .
you 're kidding .
yah , it 's not a bad school ...
i do n't know , beth . i 'm not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when harry came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page 87. how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid ...
i see a house that looks like any other house . what 's remarkable about it ?

i find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs .

daryll lee cullum , he wrote that book , he wanted the lady to have it . they wo n't let him send it to her , so i 'm getting out , he asks me to deliver it in person , he says , put it on her pillow . it has all about how he tried to kill her .
are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones ? sounds like you 're taking a dump the size of butte , montana .
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away , on the slim chance it 's ever needed in a courtroom . it 's like collecting diamonds on a desert island . you keep them just in case you ever get rescued , but it 's a pretty big ocean out there .
what do we have to know , mother ? we 're all together , we all love each other , we all need each other . what else is there ? mother , i want us to stay alive !

like old times . same booth , same song --
do you know what happened yesterday , carter ? i was officially nominated for the commissioner 's post for the lapd . there was a dinner last night , two hundred lapd officers were there .

the nazis did everything the f黨rer told them . you do everything the torah tells you . or the rebbe . identical slave mentality .
i am afraid , then , i have to ask you both , joseph as my brother , and junot as my good friend , whether or not you know anything about this , or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it .

that must hurt .
do n't be so optomistic , harry .
because you did n't say the magic word .
but ... how could they have evolved so quickly ... ?
not if you be chaste . tis an awesome test of virginity .
well , then this time you 'll have to stay for the whole match , wo n't you ?
okay .
but you do n't think that 's a solution .
afraid i 'm ruining your reputation , m'sieu laval ?
oh , this is n't my car . it 's down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just did n't think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .

my point is that you 're a clerk , paid to do a job . you ca n't just do anything you want while you 're working .
now how 'm i supposed to do that when i 'm not in here most mornings and nights ?
ted , do you love him ?
no problem .

let me guess . clarinet ?
we do n't know that for sure . we 'll have to wait until they move .
that 's just plain silly . your self- esteem is just low because she 's with someone else . but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad . it 's no good , man . you got ta get out there . the ladies want to love you , baby .
terrific .
like hell ! we 're on the starboard tack !
help me , jack ! i 'm frightened !
a scar . on the arm . of the man who planted this in alex corvis 's car .

jet ski ... there 's one left up there .

maybe they 're all protecting the species . maybe they 're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and ...
we 're springing you , leer . get some pants on .
their what ... ?
a mass . a mass for the dead .
'one shot stopping ' ... good , very good . i like you , johnny . i like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . i respect that . it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . here , hold it . check out the weight .
this is bad . this is really fuckin ' bad . am i the only one who sees how bad this is ?
who do you think you 're talking to ?
alright , henry -- we 're gon na go your way . crush this ellsberg character the same way we did hiss !
yeah . well -- we 'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that .
that musta been afta they sent me to this place call clayburn . that was the hardest workin ' camp they sent me to . the work was so hard , you had to look for somethin ' to laugh about to keep from feelin ' the whole pain in your body . like one time , it was in the middle of the day , and there were n't no sun -- you hear that ?
... we 've got a committee meeting .
four years ago . of course , that was shortly after his father died . things may be different now .
for everything .
what about you , delmar ? what 're you gon na do with your share a that dough ?
i think the man who wrote it has actually been to turkey , which helps . there 's also a very amusing incident with a kebab .
lost something ?
it would hurt . i 'm not saying it would n't . to be honest i 'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold .
yeah , they have these banks , you know , where they keep them frozen .
i saw you tinkering with that contraption , hickory . now , you and hunk get back to that wagon !
jesus christ on the cross , i said i 'm listening .
what 's that ?
soldado .
they 're doctors ?
what ?
i know . do you think if something happened , it happened there ?
i begged him . do n't see why he had to go ...
without his car ?
you think i do n't know what you 're doing ? you 're so quiet all the time ? i know .
you 're a peach .
pop the trunk . i need my tool ...
what is it with you ? i know we 've been playing games , but , we 're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help . i really need your help .
the castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it 's an escape route . do n't get stuck .
be quiet , rose .
uh-huh .
but since we 're both here , i think it 's time to take a fresh look at our relationship .
satellites .
there 's a cabin , maybe twenty miles south of here .
what ?
does that look like an animal hanging ?
i 'm a foolish man .
no . but it 's mine and i did n't want anyone foolin ' with it .
how would you look at it ?
now if i got you correctly , there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice .
if he 's nuts , why does n't the state just put him away ?
we do n't discuss it .
roy orbison . . . pink floyd .
how was i supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on ?
no sir-e-bob , i do n't die . but what i do is get older , wrinkled like a former plum that 's become the wrinkled prune you see before you . oh , to be a young man again , maybe then floris would care for me .
you fell in love with her first .
really ! so that you can stuff it with your geraniums .
maybe not ... i do n't know . i 'm not sure i 'm gon na go . she does n't need her burn-out of a father there ...
oh , yes , yes .
you know , eddie , i 'm not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
you 're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy , are you ?
what is it ? has he fainted ?
do n't ever call me stupid .
she has a pattern of getting involved with losers ... once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus .
what the hell happened here ?
mind ? god , yes , i mind . i 'm your father 's friend . a man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago .
yep .
i thought so ! he tells everyone i 'm old . he wants them to stay away from me . he ca n't stand it when anyone comes near . he 's punished me for every minute i 've spent with george . if it were n't for him , i would have been out of here long ago , but he always stops me . six months ago , i tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room . i nearly went crazy . look at me , mr. conway , do i look like an old woman ? is this the skin of an old woman ? look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman ?
the keys . she took the keys .
you lie , motherfucker ...
there 's always a way . if people get to the pope or the president , you can get to him .
correct , and that 's when --
but in your work you must meet lots of different people , every day -- new people , new faces . no ?
oh . okay . that 's okay .
i 'm sorry . am i prying again ?
-- i thought we had secure frequency . aww girl , tell me this mafucka ai n't goin ' off right now .
this country trained me to kill ...
i only came back for you .
what 's your brand ?
that 's not it .
not even a chance they punched through ? you found a hole .
you 're one hell of a detective , mrs. christian .
what ?
... and that you do n't believe you carried a child .
i mean , d- he can give you- do you hafta give it so loud ? i mean , are n't you ashamed to pontificate like that ? and- and the funny part of it is , m- marshall mcluhan , you do n't know anything about marshall mcluhan 's ... work !
she ... left me alone with that little thing , and i looked at it , and i thought this is a mistake . but it 's my mistake , not mommy 's . god 's mistake .
thank you .
tell me the settlement is right there ! riddick , please !
okay . what 's up ?
no , man .
you < u > are < /u > a lunatic !
i 'm not afraid . i toured for a year with the national puppet company 's production of `` long day 's journey into night . ''
i kill her anyway .
ed can run fast , talk fast , eat fast , and play cards fast , but he 's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz .
after this dance .
how do you know ?
on the floor ?
what 's your name ?
what can we do to assist you ?
primary trigger switch .
thanks , i like yours too .
get lost , ginger ! get lost !
where did you get those pants ?
yes , sir .
i done told the man what he could do with his train .
okay , let 's go home , then .
what 's the temperature now ?
thank you . you 're very kind .
are you in a bad mood ?
oh , actually it was . then why 'd you call it off ?
you 're not on the beat .
what are you gon na become , raziel ? queen of the rodents ?
-- so we 'd gone out to the hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins !
i wo n't take much of his time .
i did n't say i was scared .
i am -- i 'm captain b.l . willard . this is chief warrant officer phillips -- it 's his boat . we were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold .

almighty jove in the shape of a swan .
there are lots of reasons . do you want to come up ?
i 'm gon na put a great big , ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face . how 'bout that ?
there ... i 've given myself a real whopper .
where are we , baby ?
you sandbagged me on bluestar . i guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson , that you can make the tail wag the dog , huh ?
i 'm sorry .
you did n't tell us you were coming ?
baby , she 's the one who should be thinking about you . sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight . trust me , mikey , you 're better off .
leave the sled , let 's go , go , go !
well , my idea of stupid is very different from yours . so here 's how this is gon na work . would you take your socks off , please ?
what time was it ?
well there 's something new .
not quite . what is that in the lower right hand corner ?
'bout an hour ago .
i 'd love to be macho , but this is a pants wetter from all angles .
as before ... metallic mass ... verifying triminium photon tube ... no new data .
my pleasure .
but we know who killed maureen prescott , billy loomis and stu macher . i mean , they even told sidney how they did it !
we do n't have time to fart .
i 've got some good news .
betty it 's me . it 's me .
well , guess if it was trickeration he 'd just do me , huh ? then again ... i am worth twice as much alive . did n't know ? johns ai n't a cop . oh , he 's got that shiny badge an ' all , but nah -- he 's just a merc and i 'm just a payday . that 's why he wo n't kill me . the creed is greed .
that 's hotel life . in one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses -- his head .
wrong again -- but i dislike possessive women .
howdy , squire ! howdy ! oh -- how do you do , squire .
no , i lammed it around for a while while things cooled off . philly , denver , baltimore , nuthin ' towns .
but why is it doing what it 's doing ? given it 's resources , it could have done anything . presented me with your double , and you with mine .
shit . when i was comin ' up , bein ' fat meant ya had somethin ' ta eat . guy looked like you , people felt sorry for 'em . right , gerardo ?
they are ... with me ...
the windows do n't open .
fag .
sorry , sir . division is using everything on wheels to get up to caen . how come you guys are n't going ?
to james . i remember what it was i was going to say . we were talking about forgetfulness . the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting .
no ... no . nooo ... it 's just that i ... i ... uh ... this ai n't my car .
thanks . i thought you were n't gon na ...
`` blood ? ''

`` forever '' .

you gave him ice cream , did n't you ? come on , let 's go .
you 're such a fuck-ass .
oh , ya know , that 's , uh - what can i say ? ...
tucker ?
i want to know what you think you 're doing , staying out all night and worrying your father to death !
well , i do n't think i can remember it .
he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf ?

the dead can wait .
jack 's pretty tough on you , is n't he ? impatient ...

`` together in paris '' ! oh , when can we be `` together in paris ? !
going to die anyway .

what the fuck you mean you burned it ?
anyone lookin ' to pick up our trail , would see it as a sign of our passing ...
i was hoping you could tell me .
it would be too much for him . so please let him think as he does , that you 're home just to see him .
no . but a small one .
< u > night of the living dead < /u > ? it 's this gross movie .
why are you so interested ? why do you keep asking me ?

child pornography .
if magua give women to yengeese soldiers ... will receive many gifts .
i know .
she wo n't have no problems 'cause she do n't know nothin ' .
where 'd you get them antlers ?
i 've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty . they 'll need your signature .
no -- it 's comedy they want , will ! comedy ! like romeo and ethel ?
they 're called pilots ! i 'm serious , ray . i 'm not in the mood for one of your stupid , fucked-up plans right now .
alright , i did n't , but i nearly did , and if i had i 'd have been right .. i knew there was some- thing about that labrador , that dog was too good to be dead .. we got ta get back up that dump ..
i 'm not sure i 'd call them murder exactly . more like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand .
they 're going to rob that bank .
stop talking like a monk ! just fight !
what ?
all you do is keep folks from working the land , living like they 're meant to . you do n't understand shit ! trappers , hunters -- we 're part of the environment . who 's protecting us ? i 've seen plenty like you . so -more-
wrecks .
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends .
thank you .
bread ? no , no , no . apples ... . gravy ... very small rocks ...
i feel as though i 've stepped into a time warp !
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this . comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow .
what for ? that guys a dick .
i dreamed about your house last night .
yes , sir - yes , sir , i knew how to handle the old man . he was kind of queer , but i knew how to handle him .
you 're wrong . things happened today , okay ? things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin .
i guess you know why you 're here
you 're miles massey ! you probably do n't recognize me . the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair .
allright . calm down .
give me a reason not to .
guess .
preach ! go down and get me some white tavern whisky , a glass , and some ice .
what do we do ?
and what are they ?
how 's that ?
fourteen-b . it 's halfway down on your right .
take him ? now wait ... i did n't take him anywhere . we were just having some fun . we did n't hurt him ... just having a laugh , that 's all .
are you kidding ? there were sparks between us ! this scarf is a sign !
food ... and you ... my f-14 !
you know where my father is , do n't you , miss boatwright ?
humperdinck . humperdinck ! humperdinck !
italians , jews , irish . one big party . course , some guys do n't get along .
i h-a-t-e hotel bedspreads . they do n't hardly never get washed , and i do n't like the idea of lyin ' on other people 's dirt .
very nice . i 'll take it .
i 've changed the front page a little , mr. bernstein . that 's not enough - there 's something i 've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - i 've got to make the `` new york enquirer '' as important to new york as the gas in that light .
and you dropped it ?
you 're a great date . i 've never really gone out with someone as basic as you .
you 're insane .
perfectly lovely . you know , this is what we 're defending . everything that 's good and beautiful in the american way of life . oh , there 's some nut peace petitioner over there . let 's go off this way . those crazy commie bastards . i do n't know why we tolerate 'em . parasites .
i do believe the monsignor finally got a point .
you know what your problem is ? you just see the packages in front of you . you do n't see the big picture .
no . that 's me talking . and you know what ? it 's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
we can do that when we 're very , very old .
it 's grandmother style .
you 're not real .
are you marked like this ? ?
oh , will you help her ! just help her !
then get a move on . childs , come with me .
what happened ?
a snitch ?
nineteen eighty four . what fucking difference does it make ?
where is he ?
really ? ca n't wait to meet him . as long as we 're waiting for him , i 'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom .
there 's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip ?
an ' all my meals for free ...
take that shit somewhere else .
i guess .
you shut up now , boy .
even so . you still got time . relax a minute , tell me what happened . sit down .
-- haldeman i know , who else ?
scram . go home .
do you want to do bad things ? anything . anything .
what 's happening ?
i said come on !
please , ryan .
god hell ! i think i see the pattern ! this one sounds like real trouble ! you 're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over . as your attorney i must advise you that you 'll need a very fast car with no top and after that , the cocaine . and then the tape recorder , for special music , and some acapulco shirts ... this blows my weekend , because naturally i 'll have to go with you -- and we 'll have to arm ourselves .
it 's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg .
yes .
what do we do now , nick ?
all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one , all bets are off .
naah . i 'm already pregnant , so they figure nothing worse could happen to me . i got ta bounce anyway . it was nice seeing you guys again .
we 've worked up several military scenarios . before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options , i 'd like for us to adopt a rule . if we are going to strike , we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational . because once they are , i do n't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched .
where is the money ?
if there are other photographs ... i think i may know how to find them .
i just called for a second .
where am i ? what happened ? where did we all go ?
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab .
let 's go the zoo .
please ...
so you can use it now ?
we are so fucked .
so you 're hoping buzz can get you re- instated ?
oh ...
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress .
well then , i suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing kiss tickets . i realize this is detroit , but i personally find , what that rock and roll band is all about , to be boring as lucifer 's kingdom . i 'll return in a little while .
so noted .
that it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better ... he gets like that sometimes .
i 'd like you to go wait in the car . how 's that ? take her with you and put her in back .
my father ! he 's not - ?
goddamn you !
those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person .
how big it is ?
ahh , that feels great .
who you gon na call ?
well . i hear you 've been right on your toes since you got here . pitching right in . lots of people took you for dumb -- but they 're wrong . you 're smart . in fact , *i* think you 're smart enough to understand a situation when it 's explained to you --
here are two quarters . when you lose these , you 're not going to get anymore .
... like a house in the suburbs ... maybe a couple of kids ... some sort of business ... be in the bowling league ... go to the ball games ...
dr. lazarus ... i hope that i 'm not breaching protocol but.. i am so very humbled to stand in your presence ... i have studied your missions extensively ... though i am thermian , i have lived my life by your philosophy , by the code of the mak'tar .
i 'm standing right here .
mrs. williams ? thanks for the cake .
jenny , it 's time for you to go to bed .
yeah ... me you , too ... i was at your house ...
who 's this fat man , then ?
it 's bad luck .
request removal , mr. grant .
i want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me .
joad .
he 's hot .
heather , my love , there 's a new sheriff in town .
i 'm okay . people magazine wo n't stop calling but other than that ...
what of it ?
waal , then , you know , you do whatever would make you happy . sher . this is your party , and whatever ...
bontecou day . going to close with big john -- look at you , bill , all cool as a cat and over at bontecou 's , i 'll bet he 's shitting in his pants .
lousy utility companies ... they 're the same wherever you go .
her oxygen would have run out .
okay .
what ?
that 's too high . i 'll never reach it .
lois , the kickback story ...
`` mister crowley , what 's inside of your head ... ''
they are lovely . are n't they lovely , birdie ?
why ?
listen , james , about this afternoon . in workshop . i 'm sorry . i think i let things get a bit out of control .
apparently it did n't help . you know about peter , of course .
i do n't know -- let 's break some windows .
make it my first born .
what choice ?
but i hear so many voices ... one voice saying one thing , another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy , kill your enemy -- what is good , what is evil ... ?

physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation .
let it be the quick or the dead -- so it is an american judge and an american jury !
this is n't a death sentence . greg has promised to teach me fly fishing . i 'll garden . i 'll write .

`` -- going over and over in my mind every detail , every moment of our time together and i ask myself , `` what happened to me in madison county ? '' i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we 're on separate roads . but then i look through the lens of my camera , and you 're there . i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you . it 's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other , towards those four days , all our lives --

sorcery ! i believe in myself ... i determine my destiny , not some mystical energy field .
i used to think about it . i had margaret . she wanted kids . i thought about moving somewhere far away like , europe . i could see all of that , the first part , the getting away but i could n't see that next part . 'then what ? ' so i 'd stop thinking about it and go back to work . you understand ?
no . i just got a messed up stomach .
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have . all else is just marking time . you 're marking time .

25 pounds or 25 pence in fours .

kurtzweil , we think .
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born . before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... i made a very beautiful statue . even if i had not met with this disaster , i could never have hoped to do anything finer , probably nothing quite so fine . and , my child , you are that figure come to life . i wonder , some time , would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work ?
does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail ?
pinkertons . it 's the railroad .

i have to see you .
well , then . . it 's usually customary to bring the money with you .

so what are you gon na do about it ?
yes ?
how ?
waal ...
jimmy ? bushmills . lookit , do me a favor . i 'll buy you a drink tomorrow .

clever fellow -- almost missed me .
i love my country , i believe in music , what was i to do ?
he 's pretty young for that job .
what is it ?
lina , come here !
i do n't know . that 's why i came to see mrs. redi . i 'm trying to find her .
the truth is most people do n't have table manners today . and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear , civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels .
tell me .
you are such a sweetheart .
no -- actually i 'm not --
well , i did n't mean to open that thing . you can go back wherever you came from .
this is it for me .
so why , after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house , does the senator 's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber ?
hi .
because they can . you heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal . they can afford to waste all the time in the world .
do n't be dense . the party .
no !
jesus , man ... what 'd you do ?
ca n't help myself . corbett 's type always pisses me off . oh , i found this at the post office . had your name on it .
no thank you .
well , i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me . some sort of pop music producer , was n't it .
only when somebody shoots them at me .
no , thank you .
you could n't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk .
that hair contains a sample of superman 's genetic material . the building blocks of his body . with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes , i will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me !
from you , i like it .
i got ta take a piss . do you mind if we pull over really quickly ?
there 's , uh -- there 's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone . you stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on . whether or not you feel lucky . one `` no '' from anybody in the group and you turn around right there , no question asked , nobody embarrassed . well ? do we go on ? immediately :
my ... name is ...
this time you 're really going ? you know where i 'll be .
but i received a cable only this morning , saying that he could not come .
are you sure you 're okay ?
no . that was a sword in a field .
no , gittes , you 'll show us .
i never wear a hat . oh , so i am . i forgot . i guess i 'm terribly sorry again , mrs. west .
camera in the --
you 'll pay for this , marvin a. pickles ! i 'm turning your file over to the vice-squad ! ! the prosecution rests , your honor .
terrific . going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men ... lots of dates..
let me explain . no . i 'll do better than that . i 'll show it to you . scientifically . but it 's demonstration purely in the interest of science , you understand ?
not much of a collection really . i have n't had the wallet for that , so i sort of live bottle to bottle . but i 've got a couple things i 'm saving . i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc .
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine . mr. handsome , animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you .
question , sir ? his untiring pen predicted the airplane , the submarine , the bicycle , the helicopter , and even the tank .
ah !
-- do you < u > agree < /u > it 's that < u > old < /u > , nick ?
now , listen . i want you to stand on him .
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?
what has the world come to ? this is horrible . we 're locked up , burning books , hating other people-
yeah . no . i mean , you know .
we got separated right away . i never knew how many made it .
red hot . her thighs steam .
what did you do ?
no , this ai n't gon na work either . it 's half chocolate , half vanilla .
you 're -- ? what ? !
it 's not easy . none of it is . i have to find some way to get on with my life and i 'm going to try . i finally figured that out . i 'm going to do my best ... .
he 's been expecting you .
nah , man , i 'm just saying , you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive .
he owned the water department ?
sure , no problem .
how come you have to tell them that ?
darling , you 've got the wrong idea .
you feel better now , right ?
why are you so cold to her and carlo ? they live with us on the mall now , but you never get close to them .
no . you were right , i was wrong ... ... max .
... to the tune of `` only the lonely '' by roy orbison .
umm , i 'm trying to find out her greatest achievement .
are you going to have women at your party ?
ah , domini ?
let 's roll -
what happened .
hello .
i 'll get the boots .
okay , a blur .
if san antonio sweeps sacramento ...
aardvark , noun . an earth pig ; an ant- eating african mammal . man , that sounds like the dozens .
huh .
that 's why i need your help . you said you were good .
well , everybody 's been talking about that report you wrote .
jesus . i do n't even wan na ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk .
you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass ?
hi .
last i heard , his mother was going alone .
did i say `` if '' ?
exactly . and you did have a 'relationship ' with lieutenant ilia , commander .
very kind of you , we can always eat in the town with the others -
that canada story ? still interest you ?
just stop , okay ? make something up , and that 's what happened . whatever you want . write my confession , and i 'll sign it . just stop pushing me all the time ! i ca n't take it ! you 're an infant ! this is all a big party for you , but not for me ! this is serious . and you -- just ... leave me alone , okay ? you 're fucking me up .
i 'm telling you the truth . and after that , i 've always givin ' my money to retards . because that 's the reverse of what he did .
be that as it may . u is for unconditional election . god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved , the elect , and he has chosen them from the beginning of time . l is for limited atonement . only a limited number will be atoned , will go to heaven .
could i talk to you for a second ?
what will aubrey think ?
then who did ? ?
it is . he try to take tonight 's load ?
i have to go ...
water ... water -- oh , you already said that .
sure i will .
what do i got ?
me , no . you ... i-i-you know , if i have grass or alcohol or anything i get unbearably wonderful . i get too , too wonderful for words . you know , i don't-i do n't know why you have to , uh , get high every time we make love .
never say anything unless you have to .
hicks , i 'm not going to wind up like those others . you 'll take care of it wo n't you , it if comes to that ?
it 's not going to come up .
it 's not about the money anymore . ca n't you see that ? it 's about
any good ?
come clean with us , frank . were you on this religious kick back home , or did you start to crack up here on the post ?
good . you 're discreet . i like that in a partner .
yo , you think we killed that guy ?
bandit i , do you copy ?
yeah , and whose fault is that ?
yes .
i understand .
uh-huh .
why not have her pretend to find me ? pretend to write me and reel me in ? tell her new trucker-man she 'd pose as some sister of his named ashley ?
guess what i am holding in my hand . you like guessing games ?
oh bubba , think of the possibilities .
do n't speak !
are you busy on friday ?
... look , lieutenant ... uh , vukovich , do n't put me on hold and do n't transfer me to another department ...
how 'd you feel about it ?
george , do n't be so emotional . this is business . besides , i ca n't kill you , you are my brother .
who says so ?
fucking chick 's married .
would you kill her ?
poor boy . i 'm sorry your parents were so mad .
y'know , you 're not in england yet , you know that of course , and by the way , i want to just tell you that i lived in england for a few months ,
how 'bout it , eve ? can he skate around your block ?
-- roger --
- all 's i know is , ya got a problem , ya call a professional !
it 's not like i 'm some modern punk dickhead ... it 's obviously supposed to be a 1977 punk look , but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it !
it 's the same thing !
the battle is over . the war is over . you 've won !
finding this package is a thing easier said than done . we do n't even know what it is . what did we steal ?
out .
must of happened durin ' the night , i do n't know ... lord , he was n't breathin ' and as cold as a fish . i touched him , just to see , and you believe me , chance - that 's doin ' more than i get paid to do ... then i just covered him up , pulled the sheet over his head ...
it 's ... i do n't know .
you ca n't help me , man .
what rumors might those be ?
why rose ? why rose , daddy ?
this is bueno . they had the worst ketchup in prison ... ..uh ...
what is it ?
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?
yeah .
under the manhattan bridge .
i can breathe withour pain now , so i guess i feel great .
okay , let 's go in .
i know you say to take the arizona offer , but my husband needs more recognition . _ 25 .
seen him around . he used to be a cop .
remember that time , did n't i ? good morning mrs. west . does your visit here mean you 've changed your mind ?
my mom says the treasure 's somewhere in the school .
how do we seem to you ? do you think us beautiful , magical , our white skin , our fierce eyes ? drink , you ask me ! have you any idea of the thing you will become ?
you mean ... when the car went off the bridge ?
remember , stay calm , use your thrusters . we 'll be fine .
okay , walter .
jeanne , look behind you .
what ? what , that guy ?
there 's a lot of funny things down this way , louis .
all right , darling .
so i 'm to be a dragon-slayer , is that it ?
well , he 's a good soldier .
no .
what are you trying to say ?
'bike fine point ? '
she was in the car with bob barrenger last night . and she was injured coming home from a love tryst , so ...
you 're english .
they ran . as fast as they could . caught a train .
oh great mother ! he 's trying the voice . the reverend mother said it could save him .
aw , honey , our ring is just a old pewter thing -
what about picard ?
what ... do you remember ?
they say the massey pre-nup has never been penetrated .
not being partial , are you ?
i do n't know . it all happened so fast . if i 'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would 've been scared but ... swear to god , doc , i just do n't know .
no , i just thought i 'd wander .
oh , thanks .
i just got back -- i do n't know which end is up .
i 'll bet .
oh -- mr. webster -- i 'm so glad you came !
look . can i pay you properly ? you do n't have to tell him what you got . send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest . give it to charity . or something .
every actor is an invention , viktor . do n't embarrass yourself . no one 's denying that you discovered simone . but it 's like finding a diamond in the desert . anyone can trip over it , but it 's not the finder who sparkles .
forget it ... how 'bout covering a little philosophical ground ? life , death , life ... things of that nature ?
lena .
but was n't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work , sir ... ? the re-animation of component parts ?
what ?
yeah . he says that i will become a monster in two days . what do you think ?
fucking women , man ...
you just sit here , i got ta turn the fire on under the cooking .
they pressurize us with helium .
she 's the prettiest , y'know . the best damn tapper . the most smartest ...
yes , you bet .
i promise --
i was a sorority slut .
just what makes you so popular ?
you 're insane .
they韗e covering this frequency , ethan . cut all radio communications . repeat . cut all radio communications .
that 's impossible . you 'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact , i 'm counting on you --
i need a hand here ... .
private .
madam , i am here . what is your will ?
possibly . acosta is pure mercenary . and a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies . but forget about sparazza 's money for a moment and remember , there 's no shortage of those who want israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that ...
it 's not easy to be calm when -
well , he owns things .
hrnrnrn ?
rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue --
i was asking mccrosky , commissioner .
no , it 's not right .
i have to go .
i think , you know , maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin ' . i do n't know .
oh , yes , yes .
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire .
amazing , is n't it ? i even taught him to drive .
yeah !
the sistine chapel ?
you 're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller .
yeah , are n't you like , you know ...
i was afraid , okay ? somehow , i was sure it was keyser soze at that point . i could n't bring myself to raise my gun to him .
that 's far out !
are you having a good time ?
then at least i will have died trying , right ?
no , m'sieu !
nice guy . who 's he ?
get some internal police there . tell them to run a perimeter .
you sure this is a good idea ? dobisch ca n't think of a better one .
well that 's good .
just a second .
i 'll tell you all in due time , after we make love . but first , tell me another poem .
i know your partner 's here , but it 's very important that you 're honest .
you do n't have to make this harder than it already is .
ok. linda : earl is not gon na make it . he 's dying . he is . he is dying very , very rapidly --
maybe ... i do n't know ... but first we have to confess ...
congratulations , sir .
well , by saying that , you 're acknowledging the existence of a higher power . which , to a narcissist , is impossible .
szpilman .
mr. carpenter , i -- goodnight .
well what are we supposed to do ?
are you the gatekeeper ?
really .
it 's a mood ring , it tells what mood i 'm in .
get back here , junior bean counter . this is your supervisor speaking .
you tested over a month ago . i 'm sure they figured it out by now .
one thing 's for sure , jack . that 's how you 'll tell the story .
okay -- i 'll be here at eight .
there is n't much time !
roberto , what the fuck ?
coffee ?
oh he as clever about that . he called when you were out . that same afternoon , julia telephoned to him . she said that you were coming , mimi , to ask about wynant . he got terrified . he was afraid that julia would break down and tell ... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant 's watch chain in her hand .
listen , we get a deluge like this , just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough . so never mind the side issues .
what are you talking about ? ! we just met an hour ago .
well , wait . you know what ? i know .
oh dear .
way i figure it , west must have found out about their little business and was gon na bust them , so they decided to get rid of him first ...
certainly , sir . what do they call you at home ?
i just remembered . you were talking about bodybuilding and swearing .
what the heck d'ya mean ?
pops !
then it 's going to be 'i killed for sex ' ... listen darling , why wo n't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units . you have n't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping , there 's not going to be a magazine for you to write for ...
... and you 're just looking at your claws like `` how do i kill this bunny ? `` ...
you 'd have been safe in san francisco .
the poet ... something he said ...
the army ?
it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas .
listen , i 'll never make it . i 'll have to go to the toilet .
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves .
hmm .
yes .
do ? to who ?
thank you . am i going to see you in new york ?
oh . my . god . i ca n't believe you 're here . welcome . can i just tell you , i am so excited right now .
right on .
she never gave me a tape .
no shit .
you 're the only person in this place who can see right through me .
a locker at the airport ? jesus christ , harry . tell me you 're not really that stupid .
& lt ; & lt ; no , no , no . i need a guarantee from the ridiculous man . i am going to be killed . i have seen the devil and looked him in the eye. & gt ; & gt ;
i 've decided that if it is god , it 's a sick god . its ambitions exceed its powers , but it does n't realize it . it 's created a situation without a goal , and i hate that . a god whose passion is not a redemption , who saves nothing , fulfills no purpose . and us ? we would have to have `` an arrangement '' . an unspoken understanding that i am not human . how can i not hate something that does that ?
i 'm glad you told me . good night , mr. burton .
hmmmm ?
i can get it , yeah .
hello . do you see anyone else around here with a band , mr. branson ? mr. phil spector ?
... bones ol ' bones so mean and bad , whupped his mamma , shot his dad .
it 's like a joke . you remember what 's important , and the rest you make your own . the only way to make it your own is to keep sayin ' it , and sayin ' it , and sayin ' it , and sayin ' it , and sayin ' it .
i do n't know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened . that is very important .
no . i 've done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...
order me a pastrami for after ?
last time , maybe , with the puerto ricans , but these were nice jewish boys .
i see . and he came into the apartment one day , to demonstrate his wares , and your mother , as it happened , was charmingly en deshabille --
well , if he has n't , i 'm vastly mistaken .
and here you are going out of house . how 's that make you feel , jules ?
of course ? i thought he was dead .
let me tell you guys a story . in one of daddy 's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named elois .
yeah ? what is he -- muscleman ? lifeguard ?
whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am , he always makes me sound boring .
not exactly . it 's some lingerie store on the strip .
i do n't know ... i think he went out the back .
i wish you would .
you抮e not even listening .
i thought i might , you know , nip it in the bud before it gets worse . because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant .
... i 'm so sorry about your loss .
-- that 's the main idea , miss saunders . the united states government is n't going to buy or build this camp -- just lend us the money . you 've made a note of that , huh ?
virgins ?
why 'd your mom marry that guy if she did n't love him ?
she 's entering deep sleep now . heart rate 's a little high due to anxiety , but otherwise she 's nicely relaxed . all normal . she could dream at any time now . right now she 's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one 's mapped yet . waiting to see what shows up .
where do you live ?
i beg your par -- -
because in my life , it would n't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he 's from and a place where he 's going to . it 'd be too simple . i probably would n't know how to handle a situation like that .
our network covers the ranger games .
i need your help and i thin you can use mine .
thanks for nothing , you bum .
bottled water ?
it 's just for a couple of months .
piece of cake , baby .
me .
you got it bad .
i lost a bet .
she says that she 's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened .
no please , let me sit this one out .
might get drummed out of the pornographer 's union , and then where would i be ?
yeah ...
what are you asking me for ? he 's so busy lately i hardly see him . and he 's been so preoccupied .
do you have life support ?
you must take your chance boy . the choice has been all yours .
then you know i 'm not walking away from this case .
tommy , they 'll drive you , an ' cut you down like they done to casy .
maybe i can get down there next week .
mistake ?
the enemy is matching velocity .
i know a couple of addicts . stupid wee lassies . i feed them what they need . a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull . it 's easy money for me . not exactly a fortune , but i 'm thinking , 'i should be coining it here . ' less whores , more skag . swanney 's right . get clean , get into dealing , that 's where the future lies . set up some contacts , get a good load of skag , punt it , profit . what do you think ?
huh ?
yes ...
well let 's just say you 're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia .
whatta you think ?
i ca n't ... i 've got to fly to boston tomorrow .
not . now .
i said `` yes . ''
well , i say fuck that . you need to get your joint worked on , that 's what you need .
sir , that curriculum is forty years out of date . the students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired , not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times . they want to explore .
uncle birdie !

with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers . why here ?
what else ... ? let 's see ... you have complete freedom .
but we could n't *do* on any less'n what our share is now . the chillun ai n't gettin ' enough to eat as it is , and they 're so ragged we 'd be shamed if ever'body else 's chillun was n't the same way .
french fries and ketchup .
shut up .
no .
there 's a name on the gravestone .
who is that guy ?
twist , you know this guy ?
you 're quick . mayor cobblepot .
they 're coming !
the joey doyle thing . you know how he is . things like that ? he exaggerates them . too much marquis of queensbury . it softens 'em up .

action ?
heart to heart ? woman to woman ? including a casual reference to the part of `` cora '' - and your hopes of playing it .
that ai n't the tune you were singin ' back there at the gallows !
why do n't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late ?
consider it your musical education .
dorothy ! ... dorothy !
not just any carbohydrates , mind you . it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex . we should get a strobe on this thing . maybe even a siren .
that 's exactly what we are going to try and do : protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens ! general ? you may fire when ready .
i ca n't hear you .
i 'm still figuring : you 're either real brave or real dumb .
i 'm glad you 're here . can you stay for a while ?
what do you want to talk about ? i 'll talk about anything . what 's this ?
the hell with it , eddie !

you 've heard this story before ?
a friend of yours is here .
i assume you want that to go .

i wish we did . you married ?
conglomerates 're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites . they 'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line .
how i said i shot five men ... it was n't true . that mexican ... the one that come at me with a knife ... i busted his leg with a shovel ... i did n't shoot him or nothin ' .
yes . a different wife .
thanks . i hope yours is okay , too .
i was in new hampshire . i was at the old location .
you know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time .
i ca n't say .

arnie , do think there 's a difference between a reason and an excuse , because i do n't think there is .
i hope so . i need it immediately .

why 'd you jump ?
trudy and i are goin ' for gina ...
hey , you wan na see something really cool ? huh huh huh .
four hundred , four fifty -
did you really mean what you said about tuscany ?
just you wait until i 'm foreign secretary . ca n't you just see me , freshie , with all those other shrewd , little foreign secretaries ? you see , the trick is to see who can out-talk the other . everybody wants something for nothing , and if you ca n't get it with smooth talk , you send an army in . i 'm going to fool them , freshie . i 'm not going to have an army . i 'm going to disband mine . i 'm going to sink my battleships - i 'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft . then when the enemy approaches we 'll say , `` come in , gentlemen - what can we do for you ? '' so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think . and what will they think , freshie ? they 'll think to themselves - `` something 's wrong here . we 've been duped . this is not according to form . these people seem to be quite friendly , and why should we shoot them ? '' then they 'll lay down their arms . you see how simple the whole thing is ? centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants ? 梐nd i 'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum .
the guy ! the priest ! the mummy !
great .
oh .

you do n't have to .
three wakes off the back of those boats . who runs three sterling engines off a deep-v hull ?
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the earth itself !
mummy !
uh , this is our paleobotanist , dr ellie ... ..
incidentally , 'joe ' what ?
you would never understand my life . you 're not chinese .
i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling .
i would n't make you talk about it . my job is the death of marry mitchell . why ca n't you give me your confidence ?
how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle ! waiting for -- !

tee , girls do n't go for me the way they go for you .
he does n't know when to give in . they 'll kill him .
nobody else can .
oh , please , i have to go . i have to get my teeth cleaned .
i do . i do want to . that 's why i 'm leaving . that 's what you given me , see ? i know what i want now . i want a guy like you for real . not because you buy me things and give me money . the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand . you gon na give me that ?
yes , indeed . but not now . not for seven years . oh , i almost forgot -- what is the date ?
every word .
i ca n't drive , dude , it 's erev shabbas .
you 're hot !
i want to rent this one .
harder . concentrate harder .
it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind , but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design .
a major !
what ? who ?
they do n't believe me .
which number do you want , george ?
i never did trust that blonde fuck ...
it was jan , and it was a long time after --
oh , here she is .
nothing .
yes . that could be true .
i have to .
yeah , really . i 'm no fucking asshole , man . i 'm a fucking cop !
... oh bullshit . you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family ...
my fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding .
you realize that in order to do that , we 'd actually have to play the game .
you promised you 'd do the show .
good morning , wanda . hi , hartley .
told you , did he ?
this is bandit i , come back .
sure .
one more time .
elaine , you 're a member of this crew . can you face some unpleasant facts ?
suppose not .
all right , knock it off .
that 's because he is . does that upset you ?
< u > four < /u > to go .
that 's no business ... that 's a social injustice .
crap ! - i wish i had taken a photo of your face when i gave some to that detective - what 's wrong ellen - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning ?
no , he did n't .
you lose !
so what 'll you do if i feel nervous ? you 'll open your meaty , sympathetic arms ... ?
jeez ... it 's too early in the morning for this . leave off . here 's your paper .
are you closed ?
that 's what he wanted -- a ten-year- old wife . he 'd come home from a war or a safari , and he 'd wind up talking to the little kids .
yeah . that guy who beat me ? i feel stoned .
look , that 's the bag she came out with . she never even put her hand in it , and neither did i .
you know what it takes .
mine .
you heard armstrong play live . i 've never been this jealous . you get to talk to him ?
i do n't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public . the lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records , including your own now .
mind if i time you ? what do i get if you 're wrong ? a free ride ?
you have no proof that it was correct data .
get mad ! tell me you do n't like the way i treat your mother ! tell me you wish i 'd never come home !
is he wearing a green cardigan ?
what 's that ?
that 's not true , parker .
we 'll take it . you manage the building at the end of the alley ?
no !
i rarely use it any more . i have the force . the force is more powerful than any pistol . you should n't put too much faith in that weapon . work on becoming aware of the force ... learn to feel its presence within you . try to sense what it 's telling you . it 's the only thing you can rely on .
but it 's all you do .
yes .
who 's gon na make trouble ? hey , amigo !
she 'll never forgive me !
ever since you have been back from paris ...
which boarder ? saudi ? kuwait ? syria ?
forgive me , my wife , if you can . i was not born to live a man 's life , but to be the stuff of future memory . the fellowship was a brief beginning , a fair time that can not be forgotten ; and because it will not be forgotten , that fair time may come again . now once more i must ride with my knights to defend what was , and the dream of what could be .
i 've got to work ...
be cool around my men , they do n't trust strangers . and try not to swear so much , it 's unattractive .
what is this place , merlin ?
i do worry about susan . have you known her long ? she has n't mentioned you .
should i use the last bullets on us ?
that sounds kinda gay , but since you 're a guy , i guess it 's okay .
and you love him a lot . he bought you a bmw for your birthday , but you finally had to move out and get your own place . i mean , i know , it 's time to leave the nest . parents hate your smoking . you did n't tell them about the abortion . all your friends got boob jobs , you got the tattoo instead . subscribe to vaniety fair .
i 'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place , martin . we never should have landed here .
no .
very slow . but we 're not going to stop , are we ?
you ca n't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier .
mr. chang - high lamas or low lamas , do we get the porters ?
... although it must be fun to have all those satellites .
what ? you think that the girl is innocent ?
well , you know , i wan na fucking see him . i got ta know what it 's like to be on mtv .
linda ! he killed linda !
you know who i work for .
we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
how about another beer ?
i 'm bored . i 'm alone all day and i do n't know what to do .
that record company.in nashville wants to hear my demo tape .
if it was some poor mojado , swam across at night , got lost in the scrub and starved out there , we would n't go any further . but this is a formerly prominent citizen .
i had the craziest dream last night ? walter and kimmy had asked your boss to ...
hey man , i 'm sorry . i 'm just trying to help .
not quite yet , mrs. mothershead . there seems to be some difficulty this morning .
who ?
i 'm from akron .
what kind of a country has this become ? the men wear beads and refuse to fight -- and the woman adore them . america 's days of greatness are over . it has drunk the blue soup .
this is metropolis after hours ! this is what you 'll be writing about . c'mon , let 's dance .
two at nine ? perfect .
nobody remembers that .
soon . i promise . we 'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear . in the mean time , trust me , he has no idea that you ratted him out .
i 'm not kidding . marriage is -
huh .
i 'm real sorry i had sex with you . i know it was n't your idea .
... gawain and perceval , bors and bohort , caradoc and ector , and all the others -- lost to me . only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall . all i have left is the memory of their fellowship . echoes and memories . i am a ghost of the king that once was ... ... mordred is real , alive , my own flesh and blood . i will see him , i must .
father , i have tried , have i not ?
those fucking mob assholes .
what do you want to talk about instead ? < u > your < /u > day ? that 's a fascinating subject .
i ca n't .
you think on it real careful-like , miz lampert -- y'hear ?
hey -- she 's in a tough situation . i cut her some slack --
gee , it 's good to see you !
now i want you to change your clothes , tommy . we 're going to take a walk outside .
actually , the engines are smes . hydrogenbase , carbon propellant . couple generations past your last ride . i 'm not as dumb as you look .
why should i help you ? you primates -- you great , lumbering , hairy animals , drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed ! a little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world ! you 're no better than the morlocks !
but what about this ?
what ? johnny , what 's wrong ?
you 're not afraid , are you ?
sure .
..harmonica style is okay .
move ? -- we are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us .
in case i need it .
i 'll tell you what happened ... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh .
why do n't you cover it up , walter !
all right , thank you . please ask him to come here .
i 'm sorry , but without a boarding pass we ca n't let you on the plane .
fuck you .
yeah , there is a strange vibe here .
listen to me . we got -- we got into bed with each other . but it was nothing . it was nothing at all . we might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands .
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all . it was < u > human < /u > , yes ? type b positive .
let me tell you , ray , everything in life happens for a reason . call it fate , call it luck , karma , whatever . i think we were destined to get kicked out of there .
a complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition . definitely not part of the big auto show . there 's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location .
listen , joanna kramer 's got a goddamn good life . she 's got a husband that loves her . she 's got a terrific kid . she 's got a wonderful home --
jesus .
i just have n't found it yet . i tried c. halbrook , connie halbrook , spunky halbrook ...
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination .
so . i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other , and have this baby , right ? simple .
he does n't need to know all my business .
this is nice .
i had a little run-in with zowie .
frederico !
carole , you wound me ! as if i could hope to pacify you with evasions of --
no . we have ways of digging out knowledge . but it takes longer . he is suffering from acute melancholia , together with a guilt complex . he blames himself for what happened to the woman . and we know little of the background .
i 'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage . you wear the bars , you made the call , and you got your whole crew --
i kind of like `` till death do us part . '' i mean , this is forever . in sickness and in health , through good times and bad . honey , what do you think ?
no . sometimes i say `` okay '' instead of `` fine '' .
what do you mean life for for what ! for what !
it 's all over between us , doug , i 'm sorry , but that 's the truth . i 've found someone else , and , it 's very serious and it 's the end . i 'm sorry . it is n't < u > you < /u > , j ...
what ?
this is an important mission , sgt . whitman . i hope you realize that .
since i 've been stationed here ? a fistfight now and then --
lucky , for you there 's a bonus round . but poor steve ... i 'm afraid ... he 's out .
then why are n't you testifying for their side ?
you 're the doctor , sweetheart . 'guess the atropine worked , then .
i do n't think you will . it 's your father 's .
the left . it 's more natural . hey , i 've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb . what would that be made of ?
yes , that 's very pretty . i heard a story once . as a matter of fact , i 've heard a lot of stories in my time . they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs , `` mister , i met a man once when i was a kid , '' it 'd always begin . huh . i guess neither one of our stories was very funny . tell me , who was it you left me for ? was it laszlo , or were there others in between ? or are n't you the kind that tells ?
but we ca n't turn away ! is there no alternative ?
you mean with malkovich ?
yeah . i , uh , well . . . no . it 'll wait . say , he 's a nice man , is n't he ? mr. norton , i mean . he 's , er , he 's done an awful lot for the ?
i was in a bowling-alley .
there is no such thing as magic .
you 're telling me it does n't get to you ?
what 's it look like ?

she said , 'i know you love me , mac , but you 've never loved me enough . '
we have nothing to say ! you are a rotten bastard , that 's what !
we are n't gon na arrest him for that ...
it will end tonight .
look , if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is .
you know what we have in common ?
who else knew i had the baby ? !
it satisfied me .
i do n't think anybody should change their names , that way you can always find them when you need them .
how often does he get like that ?
it seems so pointless . i think i 'll go to sleep . this has been a busy day . my luggage .
at least let me give you this back . i washed it .
i 'd sure like that favor you offered a while back .
you are ?
oh , yeah . i 'm just curious about that kind of stuff .
but it 's absurd .
'sucking off . '
my dad had to help me pack . suddenly he 's afraid he 's never gon na see me again or something . it was sweet , but it took forever . anyway , i guess i 'm ready to go .
i do n't want you talking to jerry .
... what 're you talking about ?
i shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior . just lucky we left before they came for us .
i 'm not afraid of the dark .
what do you mean 'we ... ? '
that 's where they keep them . you want me to bring the tooth out here ?
go ahead .
he 's nuts .

so she 's married ?
he 's gon na be awright .
i do n't know . you seem afraid .
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you could n't breathe ? that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?
what are you talking about ?
empty 'em 'till they 're almost flat . and turn your head . there might be some debris flying your way .
tommy , i 'm bored shitless over here . what 's up already ?
ask monsieur rick .
hey , one miracle at a time . they 're on to me now , remember ?
do n't ... do n't do this ... please ...
where 's joe ?
i do n't know , i 'm afraid .
you 've got to tell me what she said .
but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else , i see more deeply into it ...
but not everyone was so lucky . two agents died today . clay probably wo n't survive the night . you 're reckless .
thinkin ' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol ' rib eyes .
i wo n't forget .
she just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air . i slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it .
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end ?
you see -- the electricity 's been neutralized -- all over the world .
yes , his girlfriend .
he 's my sister 's kid . no papa . not too bright . personally , i think he 's a retard . i only gave him the job as a favor for my sister , you understand ?
curled up on the landing like love locked out !
i thought i 'd stay the night .
i 'm going to spend < u > money < /u > .
what does that even mean ? anyway , i got to thinking on the way over . i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing . you know , like a woman with a bum ovary or something . or some nice lesbos .
here ?
now i like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure . why don'tchya put my money on the dresser .
which way did he go ?
nervous ? not at all ! no . i 've never been more certain in my life . except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams .
either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face .
i know a secret .
took preparation .
estoy bien , okay ? everything is alright . there 's no problem . okay ? this never happened . no one has to know anything about this . diego , i want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is . do it now .
no , did he tell you about it ? about the business childs ran ?
... like fried and chicken ...

i 'm real sad you do n't approve of me .

i like him . i think he 's a sweet guy .
the hip , cool , sexy thing was getting old ...
i 'll make him an offer he ca n't refuse .
what are you talking about ?
their new computer sciences division . how did you know ?
i 'm not , but there 's some of it i do n't see any sense to .
do n't look at the outside , look at the inside . it 's the inner hitler we 're after . the young beautiful hitler , who danced his way to glory .
but we ca n't kill it . if we kill it , it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space .
i think what mr. daniels is trying to say , jack , is --
which floor ?
who 's defensive ? just ... would you just hug me ? ! all right ? your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob , and he needs to be hugged .
i was thinking . maybe we should get married , carmen .
it 's her shadow-self ! her dark side !
no , just give you a splitting headache .
and was n't that an oath ... ? these are your initials here : k.c . when you signed this chart you took an oath . no less important than that which you took today . is n't that right ? is n't that right ... ?

you have to see the words . try to build a mental picture of the script . imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen .
no .
i think the ground 's getting closer . i think we do it . we 're gon na save our asses here !
i got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..

she was fast , huh ?
what are you guys , taking an all-night tour ?
i 'm not here for a fuckin ' book report . they 're your books , why do n't you read 'em ?
jack crawford must be very busy indeed if he 's recruiting help from the student body . busy hunting that new one , buffalo bill ... such a naughty boy ! did crawford send you to ask for my advice on him ?
on the contrary .
what 're you now , a desperado ? put the guns down .
what ? what are you thinking ?
no , you 're shielding her . let her face the world .
yes . i do .
neither will i .
this is not the time for squabbling .
let 's pack it up . we have n't had a customer in four hours .
officer reilly , vice .
now that 's better ... but i still sense some students out there ... who are afraid ... just to say good morning !
you did n't . i would think with all this on your mind , you 'd wait till after .
what kind of man are you ? are you a good man ?
fraulein -- will you permit me ?
ca n't you open the door ? !

so they said more than the address .
well , i mean it 's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it .
do you ?
perhaps you best ask , why you wish it . you asked william to teach you manners , philosophy , decorum ... as i said , it 's completely stupid .
hurry , please .
a walking penis capable of intelligent speech . a dickhead .
like the shields reed said would protect us . how long ?
yes . or forward into the future . i suppose i really should check on the machine , see that it has n't been damaged ...
how could you possibly know what i 've been going through ?
she thinks he 's a pig .
you better get going , hon .

would you rather be dead ?
scobie ?
it 's warmer than i thought .

well , he 's not here . and he wo n't be back till this evening . i think you 'd better leave now . unruffled , klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad . he tears off the piece of paper and hands it to hilda .
how are they with kids ?
a beautiful geek ? i do n't wan na sound paranoid , or like a pig , but what 're the chances ?
i think she 's disappointed that i 'm not more , ah , sort of atavistic . she 's got some naive , sentimental notions about indians . i 'm sure she liked me , though ; but ... . then she left town .
what can i say to that ... except , i love you too , you mean-spirited bitch .
well i was uh , just looking ...
i need a favor .
you do n't know that . you could n't possibly . if i 'd only done this , or that , if i 'd arrived ten minutes earlier , or later . if we 'd taken a different path or i had n't fought the man for the ring . you have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong .

hello .
nobody yet -- it 's all tied up .
fine . would you like me to speak to your personal physician ?
then as a sister , let me wish you happiness in your marriage .
well , i 'm sure it 's not christmas , because you 'd be worried about how much money we do n't have to spend on each other ... i know it 's not new years , because you 'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you do n't like to dance ... and i 'm sure it 's not our anniversary , because i did n't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says , 'pick out something pretty ' ... yes -- maurice -- i 'm virtually certain it 's not a special day today .
they told me , major . and i did n't hear anything about any atomic attack .

two security levels , the one we 're going in under the guise of , hotel security , has restricted access . they 're mostly there to monitor the lobby , handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks . there 's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift . if we split up , we can blend in and enter unnoticed . once we 're inside the hotel , we 'll regroup .
what makes you think you 'll be any safer around here ? it 's only about a mile away from where you live .

well , it has been explained to me that , if you add a thick cobalt-thorium-g jacket to a nuclear device , the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years .
souvenirs ? no , wrong answer . looks like your friend plans on hanging around , that possible ?
on screen .

we 'd better get to work on the papers .
what if i went up and introduced myself -- think he 'd slug me ?
the rules of engagement are not flexible . they exist for your safety . you will obey them . is that clear ?

yeah , they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then luisa hits it again in the kitchen .

why are you -- i fought for you with honor . why should it matter if i 'm a man or a woman , as long as i 'm a good warrior .

hey , what did you want me to do , die ?
hmm..smells good . cheers !
tell me about your wife ...
wait . let me get this out . i like the symphony , walks in the rain , sunsets , animals and children . i read passionately , and i like to discuss things . i 'm basically conservative , but flexible . i 've been involved in the death of thirty- two people , but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit , excuse my language .
they called , they 're going to settle , what i want to do is build up as much ...
okay . good . see you then , then .
martin hates boats . hates the water . on the ferry to the mainland , he sits in the car the whole way over . he 's got this childhood thing , there 's a clinical word for it .

you 've got no choice .
do n't play games with me , ted .
i am .
kitteridge , you 've never seen me very upset .

yeah , bazza , what ?
millie 's been after me to fix her up with a date , so i ...
yeah , i thought you 'd like this place .
i was thinking las vegas . get some butts in those seats .

no wine .
that 's true , dr. zaius . my witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater .
nice and slow . you come in . get a look around . then i get my wife .
mm-hmm ...
not my wife - not either of them .
fred krueger 's dead . you always had a little trouble understanding that , princess .
we go someplace dangerous .
do we want insurance ? i 'm just asking ...
ghastly , cruel , unnecessary .
man , i do n't like that part .
show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land .
dr. arroway , you are entitled to your opinion . but we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown , completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless .
what does ?
yeah , i guess , you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes .
i do n't want you to wait for me .
a man ? -- to switzerland ? -- that must have been nice -- for him .
i 'm a work in progress .
every year ?
except --
what are you saying ? oh , god -- you 're going on assignment again ...
who 's going to pay me then ?
no . i only saw his back . he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall .
sir , i came from the chicago offices myself , and if i may say , sir , there are still some very good ... .
jesus ...
a wedding band ? ? ? what am i supposed to be able to do with this ?
i did n't think there were any houses up here ...
we will make our own luck tonight ... if phillippe holds up .
coffee 'd be nice .
easy . you 've got to keep still for a bit , the last thing we need is a coronary .
it 's mine ?
i 'm lisa . oh , you have a guitar !
are you australian ?
the moon trying to shoot down through all these trees -- can make things funky --
... i 'm grateful to you , chauncey ... i would have opened to you with a touch , and you know that ... ... but you 're so strong - i can trust myself with you . i 'm glad , chauncey - i 'm glad that you showed so much restraint ...
not yet . not about this , either .
... hospital .
we 're waiting ...
you bet your boots , leo . it 's bialystock and bloom -- on the rise . upward and onward . say , you 'll join me . nothing can stop us .
is it me ? is it my fault ?
this is just a test case , o'neil . but if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the navy 's official policy on women in combat . or , actually , its official non-policy . now who 's your immediate superior there ?
hi .
mother o'god ...
she did ?
well , let 's do a special report on that ... i mean that 's news .
i do n't think so . keith 's about to use the rooster for target practice . besides ... you did n't seem too interested last night .
where are they ?
that you , valerian ?
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain . he said you were practicing deep meditation .
really ?
think for a second . is there someplace she said she wanted to go ?
she had white shoes .
way to go , mom !
up at the museum .
ok , we forget the blackmail . *you* killed him . how come ?
why 's that ?
it 's no problem .
i was going to my cave to find my power animal .
what do you want ?
quincy , please ...
where 'd you get this ? ! !
evening , gorgeous .
i 'm frightened .
let me see that ... not bad .
... it is n't you ... ? who is it ? who is this i 'm talking to ? i need the leads ...
losing his teeth .
no hiccups , which was good . who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous ? `` your honor , i object ! ''
pervert ! what are you talking about ?
i do n't know ... it 's not possible ... is it possible ?
truth is i usually get along better with animals than with people . in nepal the villagers call me 'kin-tan- tee ' , which means 'man who is loved by many animals ... ... who love him a lot , too ... and so on . '
go on mike .
... little bobby .
well , what does it matter to you ?
a day .
what was that bang ?
huh huh . we 're gon na score now .
is it weird ?
right . so why do n't we get on with this investigation ?
make-up . you need it . hey , roman is n't here ?
oh yeah . there 's nothing else with jake . he do n't trust banks . he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed . he loves it so much , he would n't think of spending any of it on me . i never seen it but i know he 's got more than a hunnert thousand at least ...
yes , when you worked as the nurse .
all the way to urbana - for a one night stand ?
a woman and a little girl , both asleep upstairs .
we ask questions and measure the answers . when something does n't ring true , a fact that does n't make sense , a slight hesitation , then it 's off to secondary for a closer look . before nafta we had about 1.9 million trucks a year . now it 's almost double . pretty soon there 'll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .
uh ... no .
how long you been up there , fink ?
promise ?
then , let us try together . i 'd regard it as such an honour . tell me , what is this work ?
of course not .
that 's the way they do things here in landsdown . i just follow orders .
she 'd aspirated vomitus into her mask ...
actually , no . i was wondering why cliff likes to wear another man 's underpants .
it 's better than real . it 's synthetic flesh . synthetic blood . synthetic organs ... it 's a physiological machine .
i never looked at it that way . you ask a lot of questions .
you 're touchy , sidney - do n't be so touchy ...
not tonight .
he was n't protecting me . he was putting me on notice .
you 're really good with children , louis . i can tell . why do n't you come here and sit with me ?
that 's a good question . no . i do n't . i 'm just being hypocritical here . however , i will say --
he would not have spoken of it openly .
the walkers have agreed . the ottos . nicole burnell 's parents . it 's important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that 's why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears . that 's why i 'm out here tonight .
you see that ? right by us . they went right by . you had them epps ; you called it .
so you do drink ?
dude , they cut out 92 minutes !
no . i guess .
i do .
forgive me . it is not here . i assumed he had mind-melded with you . it is the vulcan way when the body 's end is near .
where did you get the coconuts ?
no , mr. powers , i expect them to die . even after they pay me the money , i 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma . all right , guard , begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism .
okay , look . my job is not who i am . i do n't need that . why ? what 's your goal ? status ? money ? getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine ?
viktor , clyde simply has to get close to simone in this scene ! he has to touch her . he has to !
how about a trig study group ? right after dinner .
oh yes ! it is much better than what i am used to .
but what if andy gets another dinosaur ? a mean one ? i just do n't think i can take that kind of rejection .
what is it we can do for you today ?
... honest . at least you 're honest with me .
this does not belong to us . we are not the leaders . we are not special .
then eat your spaghetti and i 'll tell you a luca brasi story .
how do you know ?
but you copy my work every week .
easy sketchy .
nonsense . we did n't steal it . there 's no law against stealing stolen money .
yes .
you know what we should do ? go to the ...
you look like you lost your sheep ...
what ?
what 's new onna street ?
are you jorge cruz ?
so . i 'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites ?
what 's the matter , baby ? do n't you like being kissed ?
no ...
i mean , there 's no instructions -- what do you mean , they 're not tricks ?
down from houston . i think he knew the girl before .
you were a cop .
about what ?
i suppose you 're going to print them ?
they become complicated ... messy .
what 's her name ?
you crossed over .
i 'll be a minute .
i ca n't
i found these . the others are still in storage .
how can i trust --
but if they did promote you
no problem , lieutenant .
well , ai n't that the truth ...
daniel burdon , fbi .
it gets worse . he 's cut all the phone lines .
that ? 梬ord again ! why do you keep saying conscience , conscience ... .
we 'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship .
you 're so young , this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits .
come in , prussic acid . what 's on your mind ?
dad -- ?
now . where is d'artagnan ?
well ... er ... i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby .
... mrs. calvert ?
just as on your home planet , sir . if i may say , it took me three years to master the spikes , but now i sleep with a peace i never thought possible ...
and you volunteered .
you all put together ?
no ...
well , good . woman like that you do n't have to keep an eye on .
... would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment ?
my truck .
so you 're telling me you were set up ? i knew something was wrong .
then we will simply alert him . beloved , are you certain he still wants you ? after all , it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp . not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words .
no .
let 's not get lewd . i 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation .
even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused , often quite literally ?
lady , we better fish or cut bait .
more what ?
we all got a secret side , baby . hope you do n't think i been lyin ' to you 'bout other things , sugar .
five minutes and fifty seconds .
is n't there something you ...
come on , stand still .
what ?
hey , fair enough . if you wo n't come , i 'll handle it myself .
hah !
i also got ta win .
what is it ? ?
my father did n't have his shoes on when he ... when he came here .
a leave of absence . until we 've sorted this all out .
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
because you buckled .
i can pass !
my doctor told me that i got to move out west ... that 's when we filed in court . we did n't want to sue ...
i went out .
you 'll probably be safe enough on your own --
she did n't .
a gentleman has to have a code . this is part of mine . a uniform . think of it as my suit of shining armor .
not my head , buddy . not me . i 'm gettin ' a headache just listenin ' to you .
i came to find my grandfather .
take the neighborhood .
yes ...
please excuse this interruption .
maybe he can .
look at the bills . i ca n't . i 'm not gon na put my daughter through what i went through .
yes .
there 's nothing in the trunk , sheriff .
i can see that . but forget it . stick to tennis , or whatever you 're good at . miniature golf . here , your number 's 37 .
i thank you .
before `` the change , '' mr. verger was ... he made quite a study .
no , that 's not it -- i just want to be sure i understand you .
look .
uh-huh .
what 's wrong ?
things like the head counsel for pg & e calling me with an offer . 20 million , plus attorney 's fees . take it or leave it .
naturally .
oh brad .
there ca n't be very much-
yes .
oh , i hate it when he calls me that .
she does n't talk ?
john , throw me the keys .
i have to reach him . this is an emergency . could you give me his home number ?
gopher , everett ?
shit !
i 'm sure they will .
i could have you put under this train for this , errand boy .
yeah , well , i 've stopped all that now .
bomb # 20 to sergeant pinback . roger , i read you , continue .
what are you reading ?
joanna , go be a mother . get married , have kids . do n't get married , have kids . do whatever you want . i do n't give a damn . just leave me out of it -- and leave my baby out of it .
bloody hell , tom ! this is a bit heavy . this is london , not the lebanon ' who do you think i am ?
no , but --
that fruitcake ! what about him ?
you guys are crazy . you know that ? i mean you guys are really nuts .
now go out there and show your dad what you can do .
her parents acted like i was gon na blow my nose on their curtains --
something strange is happening . and whoever knows about it does n't want us to find out .
come . there is a lot to read
is mom okay ?
i want spaghettis .
you do n't make money gambling . you lose it .
what 's happening to you ? what happened to your face ?
i was calling yesterday .
to life . fuck 'em if they ca n't take a joke .
i was up here twice before . once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone . the last time ... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there ?
i realize you 're under a great deal of stress .. it 's clouded your judgement .
is n't that in arizona or something ?
the question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem , and therefore , how could you assume you can control it ? you have plants right here in this building , for example , that are poisonous . you picked them because they look pretty , but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're living in and will defend themselves . violently , if necessary .
i want d.a . bureau men to tail dudley smith twenty-four hours a day ; i want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone ; i want authorization to check his bank records and i want it all in an hour .
long ago . now there is nothing : the men killed each other in family vendettas ... the others escaped to america .
right .
it means she 's insecure .
but what is the truth ?
behind the books .
donovan !
no , i 've been calm all my life ! if i do n't do something , it 's gon na kill me .
you 're kidding .
he let the fucking cop out -- but he wo n't --
i 'm not rich people .
i 've got plenty of friends .
that 'd be up on your shoulder , maybe your lower back .
what-are you ? a fucking moron ? it 's three o'clock in the morning , frank . who 's watching ? your wife ? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank 's birthday party . what do you think ?
mr. chekov , anything unusual ?
i told her to get outta there .
you too , 'mam .
correct me if i 'm wrong , but was n't she one of the illustrious twelve ?
this is getting real old , john . and i 'm tired up to here with it ...
i see . all right . you finish this job properly -- and you get a handsome bonus besides --
there 's a tiny door in that empty office . it 's a portal , maxine . it takes you inside john malkovich . you see the world through john malkovich 's eyes , then , after about fifteen minutes , you 're spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike .
it 's okay - i 'll help . please .
... yes ...
did you have trouble performing ? yeah , that 's ...
at chet danburry 's house .
well , she 'll know some day .
sir , no , sir .
that guy , the one that died .
oh god . oh god .
i was home on leave y'know and everybody 's just worried 'bout making money , everybody 's out for themselves , they do n't even want to talk about it man , it 's like the fucking twilight zone back there - you would n't even know there 's a war on here . my sister says to me why you have to go there like i started this ...
but i 'll never win that .
are you often this offensive on a first encounter ?
my god . how i 'd love to see that .
i 'm about to be very silly . a man passes a girl on the street -- a very lovely girl -- his eyes meet her eyes , and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart -- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd -- and he says to himself , `` there goes my lost love '' -- and it 's true -- if he never sees her again , it 's still true . of course , after a while , he forgets -- or almost forgets -- because after a while we forget almost everything . but this man is a copper . he gets orders -- routine orders -- to go to a place and investigate a murder -- and everything points to a certain girl .
are you sure you can afford twenty-five ?
i 'm ready to be briefed . excuse us .
yeah . she said she delivered your message and that you 'd understand .
all the old men i know think about nothing but sex .
really ? that 's remarkable .
what is wrong with old habits , mr. overstreet ?
i do n't want this . what are they ?
hello .
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook ?
tonight ?
nobody move .
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles ... it glitters !
do n't lie to me , hamilton ! if i had not court-martialed arnold ...
then you 'll have to kill me before it 's too late . before i start killing people .
do they aim for the head or for the heart ?
who told you ?
i ai n't got no boy .
nothing .
we 'd be all alone . we could do anything we wanted and nobody would see .
i 'm here , i 'll never leave you again , mathilda , never . i swear .
everything will be seen to .
it 's been ... so different , being so sure you were dead .
marg !
well , i was n't always impotent .
andrew ...
increase his heart rate .
all right , charlie - this the joint ?
suit yourself .
you need treatment , mrs. peel . you ca n't resign .
three years , jesus , he 's crazy as barnes ...
i do n't want you for my father !
but it 's too late . i got him back the job ...
maryjane . you think that logic and police procedure , order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night . i did once . but you know how he 'll get caught ? he 'll have an accident , or some cop will get lucky . you ca n't catch him by being intelligent and working hard . or the worst : there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way , month after month . the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows , and hurry home before dark . and then , one day , there are no more . what happened ? did he just stop ? get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more ? did he kill himself ? did he die in an auto accident ? or a fight . or get sick and die ? it 's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth . and you never know . but you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back ?
yeah . you should check downstairs .
do you have it ?
you 're a beautiful woman .
monsieur varlac , do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech . now , i order you to come down from the cart .
there 's more people moving eastbound down old reservoir road past the elementary school .
god , he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff .
what ?
just do what i say , bob .
oh , very much ... ... i used to work somewhere in that direction , i think . a huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature .
i do want to know . he 's not dead and gone -- he 's after me and if i sleep he 'll get me ! i 've got to know !
that has nothing to do with it .
oh . i did n't know . i 'll take you to the best restaurant in town . you 'll miss a great meal and i 'll keep the scarf , anyway . what 's your name ?
you can have one at max 's .
okay , okay ... what is it this time ? what did i do now ? ...
it means they hate his freaking guts . it means if he were on fire they would n't put him out .
and did you lose her ? did she go ?
sure , but the end was so sudden .
mornin ' , daddy ...
yeah . while the horses wander all over the country .
i 'm glad you liked it . good night , jonah .
take the whole lot . i wo n't need it .
hi .
no .
i know . it gets cold so fast .
well save room for mrs. matthews famous baked brisket .
do you wish it , jack ? wish you this our wedding band ?
how are you , benjamin ?
no , baron ! i beg your pardon .
that 's very gracious of you , quince .
look at 'em . he 'd do anything for her.-
show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three .
what do you know about obsession ?
oh . okay . well , so long . enjoy your visit .
why do n't you ask her to stay on for a few days ?
c'mon .
that 's great . i -- did n't know .
make a note of that word and give it to susan . i think it 's rather touching really . here 's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he 'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he is n't wearing one of these nasty things . of course they 're grotty , you wretched nit , that 's why they were designed , but that 's what you 'll want .
let them go . and i 'll leave ...
my agent says i 've got a good shot at being the prada guy next year .
he works for colson . he used him on the pentagon papers . we 're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a white house consultant . after the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his white house safe .
i honestly do n't know . maybe to have someone to cover for him . and i wish i could , but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men .
did you see that ?
d'you bring those crayola books ?
well , you must know . you were brought up libya , yes ?
our destruction ? who ?
how would < u > you < /u > know , what --
because , it 's for the best . there are somethings that are better left unexplained .
no .
i 'm fine all over .
he 's coming to get me rachel .
you let us worry about that .
you ca n't welch on me now . we had a deal .
that 's not true ...
that 's amazing . what are you ? some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies ? how can you be so good ?
come on , man . i almost had this thing open .
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction . in 45 minutes .
nah , not dangerous . not that dangerous . not during the day .
thank you for sharing that with me , joe .
you see the play ? you 've seen the play every performance ? but , do n't you find it - i mean apart from everything else - do n't you find it expensive ?
well , it wo n't work . love and understanding wo n't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet .
it 's only me , mr. nolan . i swear . i made it up .
please , i beg you . take him away from here --
then and now . but not right now .
relax . i 've flown with my old man a million times . and he always told me , the taking off part is easy , it 's the landing you 've got to worry about .
no , i did n't --
paul , i know you 've been pretty down since your accident .
kalen ...

ca n't hear ye , boy . ... so the big boats heave a sigh , they blow for uncle birdie ...

i 've been very lazy for a long , long time .
confidence . it 's just confidence .
amy , there 's nothing there . there 's no one at all in the garden .

ezal ! ezal !
thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .
look , we 'll go out to dinner and have a drink and i 'll bring her back . because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families . and i 'm afraid i could n't quite handle that , if you do n't mind . i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life . so do n't get upset about it .
there 's a startling question , coming from you . i 'm captain of this ship . we sailed from archangel a month ago , seeking a passage to the north pole .
fine words from a child killer . you who murdered my brother .
what 's he doing ?
oh , no , of course not .
your dog ate it .

a man would n't do that ...
yes , of course . everything 's fine ...
yes , uh , very impressive .
well , sure !
tommy , let me in !
no , tell me .
i 'm gon na be here if you need anything .
we 'll talk some other -
why ?
i should n't do this . but i got a client lookin ' to score some fire power . maybe you 'll keep your eyes open for me .
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month . the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs , and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance would n't sky rocket .
would you settle for a husband ?
nah i think it 's doing so damn well because one of it 's players got iced . i just hope none of us end up dead .

miller , he 's back , he was in the tank ...
useless distractions .
... of santa fe . ''
never mind , it 's way too complicated ... did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you 're totally confused all the time ?
the job 's gon na cost you a hundred bucks .
i grant you , it 's a little odd , shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it , but it was hers , all right . it really is your mother , mister dillon .
rollo , you know me . once a gp , always a gp .
he probably knows a lot more than that . somebody 's lying .
so i guess a blowjob 's out of the question ?
he had a partner . our own ray gallagher . he tagged wade dangerously defiant . psychotic . reckless . seems our commissioner did n't like him much . busted his buns on a narcotic 's violation . wade was sentenced to twenty-five years .
brad ...
from ? from ? from ?
okay . forget it .
it 's worth a shot . i can arrange a controlled meeting . a careful dose of sedatives for jason , some security , you and i monitoring . evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck , no more missing father complex .
honey , ahh , guys do n't wan na appear over anxious , so if you think there 's a boy that might like you , let him know that you like him , so he wo n't feel he 's taking such a risk when he 's thinking of asking you out .
yes .
i 'm an idiot to have you up there .
damn straight we are .
aaah ... mother of jesus .
me , sir ?
well , it ai n't just the bed i 'm gon na miss . i 'm ... hell , billy , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean ...

if we were for real , and knew our shit , we 'd fade this one ...
virgin sacrifices ?
well , there you go . on for a video fest tonight ? i 've got some absolute classic .
policemen 's bodies age at diff- erent rates . look at me . gut in its fifties . balls in their six- ties . and feet in their eighties ..
can you imagine that brain in this body ?
oh , just some friends !
how did you get so many ?
not at all , sir .
he ca n't . we got ta go , but he wants you to read the letter . the letter explains it all . he wants you to know he loves you . and he wants you to know that as of tomorrow , all of your money problems are over .
dickie , dickie greenleaf . hello .
like ernie said , we 're all glad to have you back .
when a man steps in dung , it is obvious . there is no need to rub it in his face . the smell is the same .
she 's just so ... pathetic .
this --
i understand , but can i use it . i 'm not that young anymore , so i 'm kind of ... you know ... incontinent .
hell no !
roger , maintain .
this is fun .
sammy davis junior . terrible car accident . he has n't been the same since .
are you kidding ? i could n't be more okay .
oh , we did n't build it . the transit system has been in place for billions of years ; we 're just its ... caretakers .
here you go , buddy .
it 's the least i could do . i heard shouting .
so do i ...
twenty ? from outside the place looks a lot taller .
yes .
give us a break . all you have to do is make a phone call .
oh , no . sometimes i have dinner with ed sullivan , sometimes with dinah shore or perry como -- the other night i had dinner with mae west -- of course , she was much younger then . cheers .
so , how long you 've been living here ?
now do n't go blaming me . it ai n't *my* fault .
that 's right , mr. garrison . the environment is what surrounds us . it is what we live and breathe .
but ... but captain , we ca n't possibly take the field tomorrow ... for your own protection ...
nine days ? tuesday ?
go on .
you 're my father .
whoa , whoa . come on , he 's making too much noise .
said `` looks clear . ''

clips .
'that 's my car , motherfucker . '
she makes ten .
you do n't get it , do you ?
but you already talked about it : you said it 's not stupid . why is n't it stupid ?
ok .
it 's a fucking soccer ball , you idiot .
hello ?
two weeks ago , we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers .
just look at it !
my friend , you always surprise me .
he would have won more but he blew it at the end . did n't know what cash and carry was .
rolling .
my friend is on vacation , from america . i want to show him a good time .
what ?
one must take life as it comes -- do you live in lyon , sir ?
okay . why do n't we do something visionary . change your destiny , peggy sue . change your destiny and marry me .
but we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you do n't get that sky pilot out of our tent .
that 's frustrating .
... ah ...
where i was from , who i knew , how i knew nice guy , had i done time , shit like that .
well , whatever reasons mrs. christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator , i should certainly be a party to . but , since she feels differently , i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval .
you have to give them your phone number or they wo n't let you go on the air .
i had sold my fucking soul .
more , do you hear me ?
great .
nice kid .
as far as i needed .
yes ?
we 'll have hamburgers on the plane . you ready ?
yo , what 's up ?
i was getting to that !
paul , how the hell are ya ' ?
right . watch out for mike , there .
jeff -- listen -- remember the day you got here ? -- what you said about mr . lincoln ? -- that he was sitting up there -- watching -- waiting for someone to come along ? well -- that was *you* . someone with a little plain , decent , uncompromising *rightness* -- to root out the taylors -- yeah , and really light up that dome for once . this country could use some of that -- so could the whole drunken , cockeyed world right now -- a *lot* of it ! and when the right man comes along -- no matter *what* the odds -- he ca n't *ever* quit ! a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling- shot -- but he had the *truth* on his side --
wait , you 'll see the cat bites his head off .
they want me to go to egypt for three weeks .
oh no , i ca n't do it .
how 's sleeping beauty ?
yeah , i ...
well ?
not any real sneering as such , no .
they do n't have a wine list .
even so . one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy . it 'll be forgotten tomorrow .
no .
there goes my chance with sid .
ah -- ha ... you know , you should think about dating earthmen again .
you have n't been by lately .
dorothy ! you ca n't sleep here ! you ca n't sleep in the middle of a field !
no , i would n't like that . and after what happened today i should think you could call me scottie . or even john .
happy birthday adele .
i 'm not hungry . what 's wrong ? i spent all morning on that soup . i thought you liked worm 's wart .
do n't know if i can hold it that long , sam .
i 'm a bad girl . i 'm a bad girl .
sir , your transmission 's fading .
yes , it 's all a bit confusing but , it seems she was killed resisting arrest .
wow , you got thrown out ? for dante ?
how are you doing , george ?
i 'm in way over my head , i know that much .
about me ? how sweet .
yeah .
never . i mean ... i do n't really like ... singers .
we know the wife is gone . i 'll see if i can find out where .
linda ... honey , what 's wrong ?
what ?
yeah .
what is this place ?
well , i told strasser he would n't find the letters here . but i told my men to be especially destructive . you know how that impresses germans ? rick , have you got these letters of transit ?
you never ask a spook a question . no point . he 'll never give you a straight answer . general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more .
that moron .
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana , but , like all private property , they were confiscated by the state .
um ... yes .
i decided to make a female figure after all ! i want you to pose for it .
what if i do ?
no , sir .
sure . but you want the truth ? you 're even suspicious of him .
ms. marr !
if the key 's on him , to get the key we 'd have to . . .
you mean you 're still in contact with her ?
i know this is difficult for you . i know that you love her .
only two ? man , i already done eight . nothin ' to it . just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves .
how did you get called that ?
there 's dad , on tv .
winifred , the kids want you home and so do i .
right behind you .
for what ? we ai n't gon na have no house after the auction tomorrow !
that 's okay . he 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep .
look ted . i 'm cool with everything . you 've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . you 've always had an itch for the good life . i 'm happy for you . this could n't happen to a nicer guy .
parker barnes , i 'd like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane .
it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine .
nervous ?
yes ma'am .
heil , baby ! i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts .
where 'd you get this fag shit ?
i suppose not . got ta ask you this , though : for all our sakes , you better keep your trap shut .
no . you did n't ! if you really thought i could make my own decisions , you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage .
ai n't gon na happen , stay cool .
is the death of one species less tragic than another ?
what do you mean get back ?
-- it 's your ifb , somebody else has got an earpiece , you 're picking up their signal --
just be patient .
no , really . what 's she doing ?
now take your panties off .
yeah , went real nice with that twelve gauge , too . tell me , why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall ?
come here for a minute , first .
i just have a good feeling about you . have n't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before ?
but i 'm a married man . i got a couple of kids . i ca n't get mixed up with ?
whatever it is .
i can well believe it . i 'm sure he has done , son . he 's about as straight as a dog 's hind leg .
it is . go on , mr. thatcher -
what are you talking about ?
girl , they build gates like that to keep people like us out .
okay . great line at the end .
nothing is going on with us , is it ?
oh , i 'm fine .
i know it sounds like a lame question , but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question , but last month-i do n't know if you 've heard about this , but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
i 'm sorry everything 's been so confusing , but i have to go , robert ...
do you got something for me ?
the boards are solid oak planks , and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath . nothing real or supernatural is busting through this , least nothing the size of the beasts .
how many people were in your old school ?
the hell you will , harry york .
got it ? good . do not discuss anything over the telephone . do not talk to the neighbors . stay out of your yard .
i thought you wanted ...
disintegrated ?
i like stories .
no he would n't , i ca n't go home .

what 's in it for you ?
it 's ten minutes past midnight . curfew begins at midnight .
hi , i 'm detective mark dargus . l.a.p.d . can i ask what you have in that bag ?
a boy or a girl ?
i 'm sorry , mr. brown . i 'm sure you 're very good , but at the moment , i 've got nothing for you . if something comes up , we 'll give you a call .
edward , if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal .
he 's in the dumps , sir . agnew . every time you have him attack the press , they give it back to him in spades . he 's become the most hated man in america .
yes .
oh , i do n't want to keep them waiting any longer . they 're important people . i wish you 'd go along with me , cobb . they 're all strangers to me .
oh , i do n't know . i think proms are pretty dumb .
all kinds of shit would come out . like the ellsberg thing . you knew about that , henry , did n't you ?
will you tell him ?
nice of you to come .
maybe what mea --
is marsha there ?
yes
what 's happening here ?
she 's a pro .
fine , i 'll get you a bumpersticker , but you better start believing it ! it 's the only statement you need to make .
what do i do now ?
i know .
it was there . this angry music all by itself . and i heard whispering .
i guess so . but would n't it be better for you to wait until the old man 's here ?
what do you mean , alone ?
do n't be a fool , cluett . this is only going to make it worse for you .
sometimes i do n't even trust me .
did you use it the night marsh died ?
it bit me !
how 's everything ?
eagle thrust four -- big duke six . join me in sparaying some trees .
fortunately , not . this is my first experience with it as a physician . but i have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call zombies . i am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever .
i do n't know what you 're talking about , colonel .
strange , is n't it ? in the middle of the ocean no less .
i was trying to tell you ... it 's a game .
swiped it from my mom 's desk yesterday .
it 's alright . i 'll get it .

mirtha comes from a very wealthy family .
i 've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway . i should get some sleep .
what 's up ?
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ?
did conrad draw on his imagination ?
i know jesus says to love our enemies but i ca n't -- i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever !
what the hell you doin ' ?
gim me the weather for tomorrow morning , five a.m. andrews ...
ellie , get the gun ! try to reach the gun !
how 'd you like working with richard hill ?
i know . you 're bored already . transplants are yesterday 's kishkas , right ?
hey ! what are you guys doing in here ?
looking good ...
this is bad .
yeah !
i think you 'd better give it a trial spin . do n't want any bad word of mouth about california charlie .
c'mon , mrs. mulwray . you 've got your husband 's girlfriend tied up in there !
he had a woman in my own bed ! and how dare you call him `` dad '' in front of al . this is your father . this is who was there for you when you needed someone .
his pistol must of jammed .
i 'm plenty happy !
find the rockets . if they 're guarded , kill the men guarding them .
gosh ! you 'll break a lot of hearts .
i ca n't . it 's too big .
you do n't know her ? judy ? works in the slaughterhouse .
let her go .
what is it you want from me ?
he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing .

made a mistake -- remarkable . we shall soon see if you made a mistake . stay here ... give me that money .
why not ?
yah .
yes , will , i do . and do n't presume things you do n't know .
well , we know you were there . the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous .
a nurse ? well , sure , a nurse is great . a nurse ? great .
i know . it 's like the opposite of inbreeding . the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool .
your friends , did they ask about me ?
well ? continue ! continue !
honeythorn gump , is it ? i 've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon 's tears .
hi .
yessir .
oh yeah , murder museum ... sounds fun .
how 'd you know ?
i rat cecile out to mommy . mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship . boo hoo .
nobody give their right name ... it 's the fbi !
-- who 'll whisper it to bouchon --
why pick on him ?
he 's right . it 's unprofessional .
easy . easy , boy .
are any of those right ?
i ... i do n't understand .
i love you , austin .
claude , it 's andy , he 's acting really weird , i think something happened last night ...
no , it 's what body builders drink to beef up .
he may have an unconscious homosexual conflict . a fear of being gay . he objects to the word 'fairy . ' plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on charles leeds after he was dead . i believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in mr. leeds .
israel 's legal representation , the firm of culpepper , brody and reed , which is currently the subject of a joint sec and treasury department probe , were left holding the bag after he skipped bail . over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that 's set to expire in less than a day . rupert reed , one of the firm 's partners , has learned of israel 's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of jack dupree to pick him up and return him to las vegas ... that ca n't happen . we have a gulf stream standing by at reagan international to transport you two to lake tahoe . it 's very simple gentlemen . valacchi , fratiano , gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of the la cosa nostra , than buddy israel .
i 'm supposed to be on vacation .
three ?
wyoming ? not cody , by any chance ?
you through , mr. wizard ? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you 're at it . hell , it 's only 7:30. the night 's still young ... you can solve this case and start on another one .
poor fucker my ass ...
hey ! what 's the fun of being a teenager if you ca n't dress weird ? and we 're going to have fun tonight , right ?
yes you did . last night . to your friend crabtree . `` is he any good ? '' he said . and you said : `` not yet he is n't . '' i heard you myself .
i just thought we should talk about it . between ourselves .
oh , just the basement . some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there . it will save me from intrusion .
i do n't feel much .
thank you ?
yeah , cool .
you know ... she 's gon na be all over you like a barrel of monkeys , with her tight shirt and short skirt ... eeeww , it 's so faggy i ca n't even talk about it .
nothing 's wrong , i just got some guy on the phone on my other line , he 's says he works for this guy , this guy who 's frank 's father --
take one of 'em out , and they 'll all line up against us .
what 's bothering you , thea ? is it the general ?
cops do n't do nothin .
yonelle . looks like someone raped her , shot her , then threw her out the window . fuckin ' animals .
what 's this ?
just trying to make it look real .
or a blood blister -- or a bruise .
you mean louis armstrong ?
... you 'd be operating outside territorial united states . your badges do not count . you have no authorization to carry weapons . if you 're busted , it could take a long time to get you re-patriated . and there 's no backup ... and you will share with them all your intel on montoya ...
c.o . is colonel blake . lieutenant colonel henry braymore blake . one of them regular army clowns . push you around so it 's hard to get any decent work done .
if you do n't , i 'll come after you . and i wo n't let you off so easy .
how much time do you have ?
and i take this < u > opportunity < /u > to suggest that , equally , i admit to < u > nothing < /u > , and that i would like my lawyer present .
all right , all right . here , give daddy the flower . i 'll give it a drink .
there out on a call , perhaps i can help you-
i have nothing more to say .
no . i thought about this , mr .
gee , i wonder why not .
i say we go tonight . everybody in ?
jesus christ -- why did n't i know about this ?
this was n't in the plan .
sort of . sometimes . you 're not building an obsession about steven , are you ? look . i understand opening- night jitters , but you 've got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play .
look , he 's got nothing to do with this ... let him go ...
yeah . come on . it 'd be fun .
i 'm so sick of these soldiers .
you look tired ... .
i 'm fine ... see you ...
the stage frays one 's nerves ... the discipline -- it 's so exacting . discipline means doing what you do n't want to do and take no pleasure in doing . do you know what i mean ? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline ?
is the poverty worse , now , you think ?
why not ? well - nobody 's a great man in your estimation until he 's dead .
well , i do n't know ... we do n't get many visitors .
bullshit . we 've played with each other , pushed each other . this is different . like you want to prove that you 're better than me . who 's that for -- evelyn ?
yes , now-now that you mention it , uh , i-i-i have , uh , buzzing and also ringing . ringing and buzzing . um , am i going deaf , or something ?
she never mentioned you .

gunther ? i think i 'd remember a gunther .
go on , kill me too . just as you killed my wife .
give me a date , doctor .
i know a way .
you 'll wait till you rot !
it 's a matter of respect . why do n't you wait outside , this wo n't take long .
it 's what he would have wanted , sir .
yes --
you tried to take your life . you do remember that , do n't you ?
good for you .
what do you see ?

why , saved a little girl from being unhappy ... that 's all . drink up , louis !
yes , madame . you see , i have to get up very early . my little brother goes to school -- you see , mother is dead .
he sent me the cutest e-mail .
whom did they choose ?
lindsey ! wait a second --
he would n't say that . what he would say is `` buljanoff , you ca n't afford to live in a cheap hotel . does n't the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you ? do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all ? phooey , buljanoff ! ''
oh , fine .
you < u > did < /u > , you --

well , then stuff cotton in your ears , because come six o'clock we 're gon na walk into that dining room with smiles on . understand , little brother ?

who 's the new side of beef in tran 's posse ?
rhah ! what 's going on . rodriguez 's hole just got ...
negroes ? washington has black men in his army ? are they good fighters ? what 's that red ribbon on his arm , colonel ?

all ready ?
future man . you know . cause he looks like he 's from the future .
you live in a place , you should know something about it . explore --

morpheus , i do n't think this is a good idea .
i thought you might be asleep .
i do n't understand what 's happening . krueger has to use my dreams , but he got to dan and greta while i was awake . how 's he doing it ?
bert , the cop , sent this over . he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles .
the scottish nobles have sent him no support . his army starves . our stall has worked , he must withdraw . you may return to your embroidery .
and look at it this way . how about jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot .
i did not .
who are you going after next , sir ?
... he 's an amazing officer .
we all worked together . worthy deeds were accomplished . i liked the labor . my mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman 's heart when i turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands . i like the blood , is that strange ?
i do n't believe he did , sir . i could n't find a single track . just does n't make sense .
you have a charming wife , mr. muss -- uh , sid .
c'est la vie ... we 're lucky in lots of ways , but ... surely it 's worth a brownie .
you should 've killed her , then .
good morning ...
you heard about carlton fraser ?
i have a proposal for you .
go down to corpus for a few days . get yourself noticed . i 'll give you a call when it 's done ... you just find a way to cover that money .
what , you 're afraid ?
your call . you can live a lie . in a fabulous selection of red roof inns . or you can make one desperate stab at hap ...
how is it going to be different from this ? go see some boring footprint under glass ?
oh , you know ... i talked to hannah this morning on the phone , and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend .
`` probable '' ... applies to an event that may be real . does n't apply here .
flix . -- and how do you live ? what kind of a person are you ?
that 's a lot of commitment . i admire that .
it 's like eighty degrees in this hallway . you from the south ?
... and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma , louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans ...
you know , you may think you 're gon na get away , but i promise you , everytime you turn around , i 'll be there , breathing down your neck .
it acts as a ...
oh , you 're a piece of art , johns . they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere . or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you .
all this blubbering over that sonofabitch ! they 're grieving like they knew the man . it makes me want to puke .
that 's it . just do it , all right ?
this gentleman war n't like them ! he just give me a sody and the book .
it 's a real paris reunion .
i now know more about their affair than i remember about my marriage . francesca , the last thing i want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would ... even though we know it 's just -- i mean , it 's nothing like that , but if anybody saw us or ...
and the bookstore ? have you been working there long ?
that was the plan . and you 're thrilled to have them .
i do n't know . nightmare .
that 's okay , hanna . i 'm more comfortable in here . it is hanna , is n't it ?
how do you mean ?
yeah , yeah ... ... i like to fuck shit up .
it 's our only way out of here , mister nara .
... there are no accidents . no coincidencess . no mishaps . and no ... escapes .
russian women prisoners ?
i think i 'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
you 're not very good at this , are you ?
... to save her and to save the baby . is that ...
you got any money ?
you know where everything is ... i 'm late for my shift .
maybe we should back off a bit .
-- because a year before , the republicans were n't ahead , not in the polls , muskie was running ahead of nixon then . before he self- destructed .
they wo n't let him die .
then do n't do it .
do n't be so hard on yourself .
and everybody you care about would be dead and buried .
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him .
i thought as a child . but when i became a man i put away childish things ...
i 've got to go , now .
thank you . i love you .
but you studied psychology , right ? you did the training and just never got the degree ?

who says i 'm smart ? you up to somethin ' with bobby peru , sailor ?
so when are you authorized to use deadly force ?
breathtaking .
i know , i know . i do not want to move to seattle . but what i really do n't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something . what do you think ? it 's just cold feet , is n't it ? everyone panics before they get married , did n't you ?
what 's this all about ?
one night .
that 's my own flock up there , getting their evening workout . i won plenty of races with 'em . listen , you want to see them ? come up on the roof with me and i 'll show 'em to you .

you must reconsider this plan . phillippe is like a child , he --
the soldiers may give you a hard time . whatever . if we weren抰 around , they抎 have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides , rotting in the sun .
it 's the scientific method . it 's all the rage .

she says that ali is still in the casbah .
i 'd say that about sums it up , exposition .
that was quite an evening . bourgeois , phony , decadent , stupid .
you , madam , are a heartless wench .
what ?
guess .
no , but like all novelists , i 'm in search of the self .
that 's ridiculous .
i would n't be trying , beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing , all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ?
cuz nothing happened at school .
no . i 'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene . i just felt like doing those lines .
technically , i 'm number one . i went out with her a week before kevin did . her first boyfriend . me .

i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission .
patrick , me lad , i 'm ahead of you .

i sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling .

the `` now i get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again '' list . that list .
i say something funny ?
would n't make any difference .
pete ?
... usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft . but cash -- that 's fine -- it 's all the same in the end -- dough 's dough , huh ?
how 'd you get up here ?
gary 's not into fiber optics . he 's betting everything on the satellites .
who 's your friend ?
bill . come on . the question . the question you 've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning . the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
who 's the pilot ?
well , he 's polite .
early ? is four in the morning early for you ?
all right . all right . all right .
yeah . i mean besides that . they treating you all right ? food okay ?

i did n't bleed .
what 'll it be ? the regular ? black label ?
enough to scare me that you would n't get here in time , and we 'd lose him .
he told you she was loaded , any- thing you could steal you could keep , conrad ? you bought yourself a return ticket to quentin , breaking and entering .
you 're really never going to make love again ?
what i 'm trying to say is that -- i 'm not sure i can do this , help you , unless i know more about you .
thanks . i 'll think about it .
drive through it !
catherine , you are very dear to me . we have cried many times together . when my husband died , i would have gone insane if it were not for you . i ask you to come to my house , because i can make you happy . please come to my house .

colon cancer .
hey , rookie . be cool . just stay with me . this is what we do .
we 're warriors , not desk jockeys . we 've got to be bold . you always want all your ducks lined up . but nothing 's 100 percent . it 's always 60-40 , maybe 51-49. hell , i 'd take 40-60. then roll the dice .
laplante !
yes ... i ... i agree ...
where 'd you pick up your checks ?
it 's crossed my mind from time to time .
you 're wasting your time . i 'm already married to him .
you think this is easy for me ? you go out on the town and i get to be the bad guy . look i do n't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but i ca n't do my job as a parent if you do n't do your job as a kid .
takin ' over this local , you know it took a little doin ' . some pretty tough fellas were in the way . they left me this ? 梩o remember them by .

it 's a beautiful picture of her .
someone ... ?
hey , i 'm a lonely old man . i like to talk , too . so why do n't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you 're working on ?

i do n't think we need to keep looking for him anyway .
he 's got taxi fare .
then one day , he calls and says , 'i 'm in love and i 'm moving to mexico . ' i said what happened to the plan ?

i guess so . i got ta stop off home too .

i do not .
joe . i do n't care a whit about your private life .
who 'd you ever do a favor for ? you just let some poor bastard freeze to death , would n't you ?
you 're just realizing this now ?
you may have to find yourself a new line of work , this one does n't seem to agree with you anymore .
so ... let 's go ...
ok. i 'll lend you some money . let 's go outside and see how much we have left .
when i met with him , he said ...

it could have been a nightmare ... sometimes they dream about the old murders .
she 's mine . anyway , she would n't suit you .
be patient , ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately .
i 'm no lawyer , but i do believe that 's a violation of my rights .
no . it 's all right . i just meant , it might be a little dull for you , telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere .
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr. thompson ?
excuse me ?
i want to know what caused that noise . i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock .
the cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive .
no .
yes sir , i did .
luck be with you , sam . sam ?
do you want me not to go tonight ?
they saw you coming a mile away . if i had known we 'd be using --
two terms ; one in italy , one in the united states . he 's known to the government as a top narcotics man . that could be a plus for us ; he could never get immunity to testify .
e.m.p . an electromagnetic pulse .
do you want me to carry your pack for you ?
it 's as simple as that . you 've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud , jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy : it 's a pecking party .

i 'm sorry if i was in the way . it was totally impressive . great piece .
i leave it to you , mr. deeds . can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle ?
ouch .
i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours .
we could laze around here a while longer .

you 've made your point perfectly clear , mr. kane . good day .
yeah ?
you 're doing just fine .

ai n't you goin ' to record it ?
well ... listen , if you need any help , you know , back up , call me , ok ?
that is correct .
none of us can remember that night . i get flashes of it but they do n't make sense . we saw shrinks for years . but nothing they did could ever touch it . what happened ? was there ever an offensive ?
maybe their silence is a sign ... ? maybe it 's a sign to go home ?
i was at the house one morning -- i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr. marsh . when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial .

probably nuthin ' , but that 's why it 's such a sexy way to go . sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook , a different unique perspective . a black director , y'know what he 's gon na do given the subject matter ? with this kid , the possibilities are endless .
cathy ?

i 'd come back --
who 's that then ?
what 's peggy sue going to do at your lodge meeting ?
it 's time for drastic remedies .
anything else , mr. black ? how about some water ?
nothing .
yes , that 's true . we have to find him , run tests , determine if the polymerization is stable .
what about the future ?
they do n't kill a guy for that .
no , she was crying her eyes out .
he 's doin ' twenty years in susanville .
in case things get too intense . it automatically freezes the game , gives you a breather . things can get pretty wild ...
take it easy , ruby ... it 's all right . now , try to think clearly ... do n't you mean _jason's_ hand ... do n't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed doctor layton 's throat ?
just promise you 'll do it .
what do you mean , it changes ?
what do you know about dating a single mother ?
i mean tonight .
everyone has a job - a function . each one teaches you more about your invention . i 'm what is called a < u > murderer < /u > .

nah . the big mask was better .
the 'question ' --
do you ever pray ? you know ... believe in a supreme being ?
you are , i was about to say , no longer eligible .
fluid breathing system . we just got them . we use it if we need to go really deep .
that 's true . why is that ?
that 's good , mr. gardiner . or may i call you chauncey ?
yes , of course ... maybe one hour .
we 're not gon na hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom . i 'm not gon na sit in congress and write a law that allows the nsa to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like . and the next time you have something to say to me , we do it above-board , in my office , like everyone else . now get outa my car , i 've got a committee meeting on the hill .
this is nothing like austin . forget about it .
alright i got you , man . it 's my turn for freak patrol .

yes , i 'm here ...
probation ? man , you crazy . they shouldn't 've let you outta your country , much less prison .
dwayne put the gun down --
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job .
you know , if you really wanted to scare the kid you could 've just pulled a gun on him .
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells .
i think that either you 're going to give them to him or he 's going to make you give them to him .
doesnit sleep ?
i have rehearsal .

he came for me , i had to run !
i 'm sorry , sam , i 'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked .
well , hurry up so you can come home ! we miss you !
no beer ?

that 's the punchline . she 's still alive , in stable condition . another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably . is that pate ?
oh , really ?
tragedy ?
what sort of danger ?

good luck , captain .

gin .
i told you . you need to rest .
oh , you did ! well , that 's very , very interesting . this happens to be the gun that earl williams shot his way out with !
no , you 're not ! you 're going to claim executive privilege and you 're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the fifth amendment . i do n't give a shit . they ca n't force the president 's people to testify .

thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .
how did they get it away from him ?
when whoever it is makes their move , you wo n't be here to ask if he 's the one .
but you 've no right to publish ! behind my back , without my sanction !
right . raymond ... a priest .
just seeing how you 're doing . and , um , mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again , and we 're wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans , or should he be at one of the singles tables ?
yes sir . you ort not know that language .
what about entrapment ?
she was afraid you 'd make a big deal out of it .

uh father , i know she 's been through a lot ... but the sacred stones..we do n't have much time..
why , down at the office , we always look at gallagher as - eh - just gallagher , that 's all .
nothing 's wrong with trying to talk to me , zoe .
listen to me , patrick . i 'm leaving .
who ?
oh now , do n't be silly .
it 's still a good idea .
looks like it took out the backup genny too .
because i have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle , the other the men .
all right - i 'm mad . i 've seen a ghost ...
know what you mean , blair . trust is a tough thing to come by these days . just trust in the lord .
elizabeth . if it 's true , travel into germany would be banned . you 'd never get near ingolstadt . besides , they 're only rumors .
after your fever broke , you 'd wake up in spells ... long enough to get that medicine in ya .
automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and ak-47 's .
thanks .
why , clarice ? did the rancher fuck you ?
that would be correct . orders from the president himself . trans- portation at your beck and call . no delays . although , the government 's generosity takes me a tad by surprise , as well .
yeah , thanks pal .
so will you , someday .
obviously someone else knows it ! get everybody back to their posts -- now !
i think i 'll hang on to these .
underbelly !
waiter , busboy , maitre-de --
i 'm up .

starck , why are n't you on the bridge ?
< u > what < /u > --
you did n't get me in trouble .
stay low .

were you asleep ?
of course , it would have to be someone with access to the prevision in the first place , someone fairly high up --
especially at the casino , where he definitely did not work , people got the message .
yeah , you do . i 'd be bugging myself , edgar ... who 'd get the tapes ?
we 're grateful , ted . it 's not that . those craftsman tools ... they 're a dream come true .
yes ?
i 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively funereal !
i 'll be up in five minutes .
i wo n't wait until tuesday . i 'll break your arms right now .
vanessa . shit , you better get out of here .

nano ... but nanotechnology is impossible .

writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him .
just a quick word , ms. langenkamp . for dylan 's sake .
oil , gas , cattle , farmin ' . ai n't nobody shows off around here . iguana county 's one of the richest in texas .
i should do this .
i 'm with the band . i 'm the lead singer .
enjoy . well --
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government .
yes .
yes .
why were you afraid ?
oh -- i 'll take the same , i guess . and coffee .
i know why you broke up with me in college . and not that what you did was n't messed up , but what i did was , too . so if you forgive me , i 'll forgive you .
let me just run through a few things . as a dealer you never gamble , not anywhere . we 'll need your picture .
come on !
i varn you . if you do n't lie on the floor , i vill have to stun you .
yes , to cease to hope is the greatest crime . the greatest crime . perhaps the < u > only < /u > crime . < u > i < /u > never ceased to hope !
i understand .
i told you ! right here !
... the whole world 's out to get you ...
be unto her o ' lord a fortified tower .
what i did to joey .

bag some z 's ?
when he says , `` discussion '' , how do you take that , agent desmond ?
but there is n't a b-2 bomber .

well , i 'll pay you that back sometime , mr. hillyer .
i do n't know . extra apartment keys . what 's it matter ?
why you got ta front me like that ? i 'm talking to kip --
is that what he told you ?
do you feel better now that you 've said this ?
very well . i suppose i could make out my weekly report to starfleet command without your input . `` admiral lusby , regarding the unusual behavior of jean-luc picard : i find him increasingly irritable , remote and uncooperative . i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to- ''
who cares ? i do n't see no treasure .

i want to help you .
they did , admiral .

because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
oh , no , do n't . i love that old house .
take him to the car , bob .
i 'm serious . you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs , i 'll guarantee you 'll have a triumph- de-luxe . mind you , it 'll have to be in german .

and now he 's addicted to painkillers .
i have to !
yoo hoo , bomb ...
i saw your face , mulder . there was a moment of panic .

hi .
thank you , thank you . you know , susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday , but already the people here at the king corporation 's moorish manor have made us feel , well , a part of the family . and it 's their hope that , before you leave , everyone of you will feel a part of that family also . so , if during-the next few days , we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... do n't be a stranger . stop . say hello . introduce yourself . because here , there are no strangers , only friends . and family . right , jack ?
who can say ... ? best thing for him , really . his therapy was going nowhere .
so suzie , you called us , remember ?
i intend no slight to you , but i can not find the english to adequately express just what he is . i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury .

why did you build this whole place ?
it 's my name . maybe that sounds silly to you but ...
prove it .

sit down , kafka .
john 's a feller who likes to keep secrets .
quite a while ... an hour , an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that 's quite a while , is n't it ?
jesus ... this is inhuman . uh ... i was n't told of any operations in this area . they should n't have been here .
i knew something would happen when they started puttin ' up fences and passin ' laws .
mr. hadden , i 'm a scientist ; i do n't make deals ... but . if you wish to give me , in good faith , access to your information , i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it does n't conflict with the best interests of science ... or my better judgment .
hey , buddy , that boat still runs , eh ?

take him off the air .
listen , darrell , about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i 'm going i swear i 'll --
if you do they 'll be seeing him everywhere , on every street corner , in every house . just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes .
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves - i leave those to louisa may alcott . but i do know you .

i don抰 know ! please stop yelling at me !
mmm hmmm .

here it comes again ... the sacred job ...
i see . and when was this unholy alliance joined ?

this is tom ripley . freddie miles .
it 's a very moving experience , trust me .
is shemp all right ?
samoan jo 's ? yon mean the pub ? hold on . . .
mr. ortega , what is shu kai kim 's rank within la compania ?

no , no .
we trust you , lloyd . you know that .

sure .
like the dress ... ?
hi .
okay
twinkeys !
drive ! drive away !
you do n't owe me that .
maybe , if it 's a real mourning ring like we have in jamaica . all you got to do is turn it on your finger , close your eyes , and make a wish .
sleep is something one must learn to overcome . i learned how to do it when i was a child . i never slept . and i had friends who even slept less than i did . the one who went to bed first , paid a penalty . and we really did n't do anything . after seeing a movie , we 'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while ... then we 'd sit down on a bench somewhere ... listen to some drunkard ... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes ... or look at the sheep passing by ... or go for a stroll around the market place ... or else we 'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name ...
how long can you go without sleep ?
nice talking to you , travis .
hi .
you make me sound like the father in `` east lynne . ''
you see , i do n't care if we are rich or poor -- i do n't care if we 're big or small , all i care about is jabez . he was the first man i loved . he never used to care about money -- we were poor as job 's turkey , but none of us minded . now i 've seen him drive the poor from the door , and we used to be poor ourselves . i 've seen him get hard and mean , and he is n't hard or mean . i 've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding . that 's not like him , mr. webster -- it must be my fault somehow -- my fault .
i 'll come by your place , right after ... drink , take pills ... love you .
maybe you should go out with him . if you keep avoiding him he 'll get suspicious . besides , what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who 's investigating you .
yeah .
good evening , miss .
henry clerval .
i would n't be a waitress . they 're nasty and full of crap .
i 've been so lonely .

good .
oh , please . okay , so give me the zen master 's address , i 'll think of a reason to stop by .
uh ... bob . like to speak to you . take a minute .
hey , what 's that ?
what a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'your highness '' .
good , because i checked your salary -- and it bites . how the everyday working-class stiff survives in today 's economy is something i 'll never ...
it would n't happen to be your construction company gon na get the bid on building this thing , would it , h.l . and jorge , you would n't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters --
they outnumber us , my lord --
i do n't think so .
yes ... ?
will you stay ? please ? i 'm afraid to sleep ... i do n't want ... < u > him < /u > ... in my head ...
i thought he did n't have to pay anything because of the technicality .
the best .
i need you .
mr. thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight , charles . you 'll be leaving on number ten .
hello . and goodbye .
ooh .

i 've struck the mother-lode . i 'm counting ... spade work ... .
some of them ...
bruce , i know , but i was in the biggest jam --
now do n't you think she looks just as pretty in color ? do n't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her ?
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects , but i ended up specializing in foreign languages . i wanted to travel -- see the world . in my last year i was accepted into the m.o.d . in the cultural studies sector . i thought i was off on an exciting career , but my job was to read everything printed in every country . it 's very boring . my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi . if i do well with this case , i finally get promoted to field operative ...

yes .
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i do n't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you 're coming back ... or if you 're coming back .
i know my behavior is ... erratic sometimes .
do n't worry . it grows out about an inch by them .
usually , in adults , it 's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...

i apologize , barton .

two sets . i do n't know . maybe they 're not even his .
there was a car in the lot when we closed . gone today .
you 're from the same neighborhood . south boston .

we ca n't go anywhere until i get to a phone .
i do n't think mr. sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary . considering who he is and all , famous and all , he does n't have airs . drives the same car out from new york each time -- '65 mustang -- said it helps him think . he was always a good guest , never made a noise , never bothered a soul . sure hope nothing happened to him .
that 's your life ... not mine .
whoa ! easy , fouch . i do n't like where you 're going .
... so , we 'll hit the library first and fan out from there . they 've got all the l.a. phone books , plus medical directories ... we 're not gon na let him hide from you any more , okay ? i 'm making this my personal mission .

the number one turbine 's pretty well trashed . number two runs , but it 's way underpowered .
who are you ?
you mean a misfire ?
believe me , leon ca n't help you . he does n't know anything about the jewels ... i give you my word ... i swear it .
how about a dance ?
at first , like everybody , i was a soldier .

i passed out , but i 'm okay .
yes , it would .

where is this thing that attacked your wife ?
nobody asked you to .

please ! please mister , please ! this is vital i go to saigon . this is very important . most important .
do n't make so much out of it . only reason i have n't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i 've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive . believe me ; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had . i 'm no better than anybody else . i 've just been busier .
maybe , maybe we can adopt a child . he said you could adopt one --

`` cora '' is my part . you 've got to tell lloyd it 's for me .
fine . good .
you 're out of your mind .
no . but the boston globe critic jay carr hated it .
this should be it ...
yes , but as a black painter ?
i *don't* think that 's the thing to do ! no ! i think what you ought to do is -- *fight* !
we can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here .

he 's kind of a miracle .
what i can appreciate is insolence , mr lombard !
elaine .

this is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years . very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see , matthew . the red sox win a world series . this is deeply , intensely personal . all the mistakes i 've made , all the envy , fear and violence that 's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes . and your grandmother knows why .
how do you know ?
she 's beautiful . look at her . henry , look at her .

i stayed pretty close to the compound , figured if anyone came to look for me , that 's where they 'd start .

roth engineered it , michael . he made pentangeli think you hit him . deliberately letting him get off alive . then the new york detectives turned frankie over to the fbi . my informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him . anyway , they had him on possession , dealing in heroin , murder one and a lot more . there 's no way we can get to him and you 've opened yourself to five points of perjury .
what is your quest ?
with about twenty of his spies on my tail . no thanks .
we 're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex ...
then he had to bang it out across the street at the bank of the caymens ...

a terrorist ?

we 've got to get these kids out of here ...
thanks . that was good , that crow sound .

just a formality .
aw , nuts ! you 're just like your old man ! once a plumber always a plumber ! there is n't an ounce of brains in your whole family !
here it is .
toast ? no ... just the butter .
i did n't want to bother you during your racquetball game .
yes .

as well as can be expected , i guess . give me the bad news .
no ... but what choice have we ?
i want it back now . i never should have taken it off , i want it back .
quickly men ... word association , coop . what are you thinking about right now ?
better late than never . korean war hero , sheriff for near thirty years -- buddy deeds memorial p --

a-negative . i 've cross-matched it .
oh , sorry i spoke .
how could i ? i was sleeping .
hullo , bob . boys , this here is english bob .
well , suppose we did ? that is n't what i got married for . what 's the good of -- look , walter , i came up here to tell you that you 'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it , because i 'm --
to everyone , i 'm afraid . the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession , as we know it , is being legislated out of existence .
well , sure .
why do n't you call him ?
really ? you told your father what you told me ? you let him see your passion for acting ?
oh right ... so it 's just complicated for you and jackie -- for me it 's pretty simple cause i just do n't understand ...
you know - you know - you know what they 're doin ' to me ?
yeah .
oh , he did . half an hour later a certain timothy j. nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking .
you know this citizen kane picture ? about pops and everything ?
homesearchers .
was anyone waiting for the bus with you ?
we can forget horse racing , roulette , the stock market ... our worries are over ! you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers ? you will be in a position to give it to me .
ben , i 'm a man of god .
you have no shame .
drugs ? ? !
i guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights .
you all right ?
yep .
no . you ask for too much .
yeah -- but high livin 's made me soft .
that 's why i picked it . we can start a whole new life down here .
she talks to me .
i 'm coming in now . i 'm down by the emergency air lock . too much trouble to come in the ventral lock . would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so i can come in ?
no -- i 'm lying to amuse myself ! now look here , i 've an idea that will get us out of all this . we have n't twopence between us , but we 've got these .
-me , my god , it 's a great day !
years , why ?
no , you do n't understand . your daughter-
oh yeah ?
i got ta talk to you .
jody , she tried to kill him .
excellent . couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell .
well , i do n't go to the plaza every night .
well ... see , at my old convent , i was n't always ... real popular . i was sort of selfish and ... not real helpful . okay , i 'll say it -- i was n't much of a nun . but now , thanks to all of you ... maybe i 'm shaping up .
that you , rog ?
lem me take you down in the basement and show you what you 've become .
clark ... son ... that ... thing you did with the sheriff today ... those ... stunts ... you do n't do those things at school , do you ?
you got a leak in the number nine compartment .
fok yu and fok yu two ... are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason ?
he 's half poodle and half watch dog -
not on this trail , i do n't . i 've been over it before . anyway , you ought to be pretty sleepy . why do n't you climb in back .
amazing ! she still does n't look over 20. when is she likely to grow old in appearance ?
come on , harry . this is america , land of the free . i thought we might go skinny dipping . for starters .
where do you get this shit ?
yeah , i always wanted to watch you eat .
i thought maybe you forgot ...
can that count as one question ?
well , we got the prom coming up , all these parties . we should n't upset our parents ?
i would say it sounds like you 're trying to get me into bed .
because -- it 's beyond intellect . it 's emotion . it 's passion . it has to be experienced -- it ca n't be imagined .
`` my type '' ? what is this bullshit ? how would you know what `` my type '' is ?
great .
you 've come back to me , louis ? you 've come again to me ?
that money 's not ours , adam -- if we keep it , we 'll be breaking the law .

someone goes to walmart , gets some buckets , brushes , mops , spic and span , the works .
my handle 's silver tongued devil and i 'm here to tell you , your fellow cb'ers are mighty proud of y'all .

husband ?
maybe .
every day i look in the mirror and say , `` what ? you still here ? '' man !
nobody did .
shit ! it 's both of them . the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro . but they 've moved on- -they 're getting closer to sidney . they 're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill . they 're looking for the new tatum .
he could n't get through a sentence without all these big words ; about why we kill .
i live on tips , so do n't be offended , but you 're a liar . i saw you kiss . admit it , this is the street where love lives .
for what ?
you did n't play it for laughs last night .
how is she ?
do me a favor 棗 keep sending them .
he shall be endured
they 're not just our business managers , panes .
you 're the one with the star-spangled hard-on , not me .
you worship yourself .
did mommy ever see this ?
i thought maybe you 'd like to hear a song .
you found buckley ?
your uncle had a weakness for dark ones , tall and stately . how would you like yours ? dark or fair , tall or short , fat or thin , tough or tender ?
no .
what do we do ?
nice house for a shaman 's daughter . you must be good .
let me jingle you right now .
okay , we 're in business .
excuse me ? do i know you , friend ? take a look around you . do you even know who i am ?
that sounds dandy , but it does n't replace a father and a husband on easter day .
oh sweet lord , everett , looka this !
then you did n't know richard later on .
a ground swell-christian movement , george , you see ?
big trouble .
why ?
malcolm , you can be anything you want . you got class and you 're smart .
what he 's trying to say is : every team needs a mascot ...
i do n't get involved with guns .
i 'm fine . i 'd just rather keep it on .
smith ? smith ! fuck !
what are you doing ?
you did n't like them .
jack , take it easy . she gave blood at school today . maybe she 's just a little light梙eaded .
i 'm still the king !
i 've been contradicted all my life ... eternity !
give me the fucking shooter !
so i hear .
yeah , well , i 've sort of been out of commission . how 's melville ?
can you develop an ulcer in two minutes ? being cool is hard on your body .
so when you sleepwalk , you go somewhere familiar ?
families should n't be separated . i 'll never make another long trip without you and the kids . we 'll all be together .
ye-es ?
really ? well , you know , he 's quite good . i 'm surprised . anyway , i have a session with malkovich i have to attend . i 'll speak with you soon .
it 's not a 'sit down . ' he said he 's telling us the plan .
mr rothstein ... well , sometimes , when you reach that pressure point , when you put that pressure point on them , you know , it shows ...
all finished .
love .
good luck it did n't happen a few miles back . maybe they never would have found you . day like today you 'd be dead for sure .
why did n't you tell us ? why did n't you tell us ?
you think i --
of course , mr. lebowski on the right , mrs. reagan on the left , taken when --
feel good ?
i think i had some when i was eight .
what did you think of that wadja film ?
i can give you many political answers paul but the truth is that africa is not worth a single vote to all of them : french , british , americans .
your teeth are fine .
is it real ? you people are sick .
shut the heck up ... pop .
then i 'll see you in hell .
and on my time .
and < u > do < /u > bring miss marsh -- -- when she 's had time to tidy up a bit .
but she 's dead !
i ca n't ... the car vanishes and all of a sudden i 'm on the ground in the woods .
i believe so . saw it on a television show , once .
give her some cigarettes .
sorry to bother you , bud .
i know . it 's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me .
no , my dear , he is a federal agent . he killed two of my colleagues the other night .
i did .
i ca n't . he did n't do anything . thanks to you .
i do n't want to hear about your fucking dreams !
who are you ?
guess who wrote it ?
i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride 's bouquet .
okay , even with all our savings , it 's still only six hundred fifty-four .
you were n't exactly horrified .
he 'll give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .
no . yeah , once in a while . you know , like occasionally .

five . the five longest .
i did . i ... this is stolen . i came back .

i treated you better .
so , you 're saying thse guys have like , lasers and stuff ? they could hack him to pieces ?
my high is low . i 'm dressed up with no place to go .
i think water got into the electrical system . you ride me back to camp ? i 'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning .
i do n't . neither do you .
i turned it off . it 's like an open window he can climb right in ...
oh . run .
not that it matter much but..i seem to recall you staying something like , 'i was hoping we could work together . '
good evening .
i want to see my mother . where is she ... ?
the cenobites . it 's only a matter of time before they find i 've slipped them . i have to get away from here .
yes -- very , very big !
your command is my wish , princess lili .
good heavens , man ! you 're not suggesting that i ?
no ... wait . hold me .
do n't be absurd ; it 's only a play .
look here , partner . you may not like my nose . but i do . it 's a good nose . the only one i 've got . i always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it . if you decide to do it , make sure you do n't miss .
i was told they discriminate against people with hygiene . i never < u > believed < /u > it .
i do n't mind it . it was harder before the war . trying to keep up appearances . now it 's patriotic to be poor .
come on !
ich , my name is nick . not nicklaus , not nicklaus-san , not nick-san . nick .
if you knew why , you might know where to look for him . i do n't envy you this ; he 's not done -- he 's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush . now , i 've done what you asked me .
whoever it is is n't shooting at us ...
you did that , did n't you ... ?
-- it was dean , you fucking idiot .
it was pretty gory ma , let me tell you . but you have to turn all that off , and do your job , just like pop used to say .
as she 's a member of my staff , may i ask what this is about ?
no , sir .
do n't worry , it wo n't last long .
you 're zimmermann 's calculator , archie . all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal , you got to know something . maybe they told you , maybe you overheard things you were n't supposed to hear ...
we 've struck ice .
newer , more powerful design .
i mean it , there is only three of us here .
fbi too ?
people pay good money for that ?
if tatum sees you -- she 'll draw blood .
her . that look . she likes the ed guy better than she likes the brother .
never seen the optical sky myself , but i hear it 's nice too .
does n't matter who she picks . no woman is going to last one week in a commando training course . and i do n't care who it is .
no sir ... i just wanted to know if you needed a hand ?
holy toledo ! that 's six years ahead of schedule !
sorry . got held up . what are you doing here ?

my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead .
yes . i would swear my love to you .
yeah .
leave me alone !
leon , do n't ever ask me for a picture of myself ... i could n't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer ... i could n't breathe , i could n't stand it .
it 's my last and final one .
harry zimm . the man happens to be a major hollywood player .
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short .
no , look ! it 's `` ope - recall mistake . ''
when jeff gets through with taylor -- quiet ! what do you mean by breaking in here -- ? get out ! get *out* of here !
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking .

alright , relax . 20 minutes . soon as we 've passed tara 's rings we 'll make the course correction .
sooner ... or later ... i 'll have to stop .

just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood .
do me a favor ? eat it , and then give me a secret report , okay ? pay particular attention to whether it 's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup .
the proof had his throat slit . so far you 're not denying it .
yeah .
oh , it 's coming , it 's coming .
`` we 'll all have lunch . '' good idea . oh , and let 's be sure to invite this sociologist , too -- just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards !
miles , how nice of you to see us -- may i introduce howard d. doyle of doyle oil .
to kill and be king , is that all ?
no , do n't let 's have it any color ... no color ... just a house house ... let 's form our own party .
thank you , swana . you are very gracious .
you damn well thought wrong .
seems to me you 're doing excellently without any assistance .
yeah ?
fine . i mean , it 's not like i was doubting you , it 's just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire .
the problem with that is that then there 's one extra --
freeing stravanavitch is gon na get tens of thousands killed . i ca n't live with that . i 'm not royalty . i 'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office . we do n't negotitate . not as long as i 'm president . is that understood ?
and each contestant gets one of these . an `` i tried to screw a network executive '' tee-shirt .
two . one ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock .
who 's norma ?
how about what ?
thank victoria for dinner .

what do you mean ?
they ai n't the only ones .
i want to see the body .
so what 's the problem ?
i have seen him again . last night .
oh yes , yes . one day a beautiful car comes here . this beautiful lady in furs gets out . there is a handsome man with her , and the chauffeur the lady rents one of our upstairs rooms . the chauffeur changes the lock on the door . then the lady never comes back -- not to live , anyhow . she came back three , four times , but always alone and just to eat .
oh no , stifler , what did you do ?
... we have a wonderful electric sign : `` dine with buljanof , iranoff , and kopalski . ''
it 's okay . it 's okay .
boy , i 'll bet he 's strong . i bet he could knock down a whole building .
i know , dad !
no ? well , i guess he just has n't met the right woman ...
i 'll go with you .
you 're not supposed to be here , ma'am .
how far away is filter number four ?
benjamin . that 's supposed to explain it ?
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they were n't kept separate i learned to my cost .
what ?
no . you 'll want to ask a lot of questions i do n't want to answer right now . i already have a ride .
i called dan koretzky because he --
nope .
i forgot . you never drink with ... i 'll have another , please . you despise me , do n't you ?
we 're friends , harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid congressman , do n't we ?

i scanned it at arecibo ; negative results , always .
wish i could help , sheriff . but if you 'll excuse me i 'm going over to harlin 's to pick up my car . then i 'm getting the hell out of this place .
you do n't get it , guys - he ca n't go down any further . we got to protect him full time .
i thought you were babysitting tonight .
ethan , i keep telling you there 's not a chance of locating nyah til i access the satellite and there 's not a chance of doing that til i get this thing booted up and running ! how much time does she have left ?
where is she ? tell me !
i think i 'm falling asleep .

almost quaint .
nine .
cover ... our footsteps ...
so they build another death star , right ?
what ? ! how can you -- i 'm sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much , but i happen to value having someone to talk to , especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say , it 's wrong and no matter what i do , it 's wrong ... i 'm sorry i 'm such a disappointment to you .
do n't play with me dear , you 're way out of your league .
who cares ?
they dragged me downstairs . i thought they were going to kill me .
you did . but ned alleyn and the admiral 's men have the playing of it as the rose .
probably all the other families will line up against us . but , it 's alright . these things have to happen once every ten years or so ... gets rid of the bad blood . you got ta stop 'em at the beginning . like they shoulda stopped hitler at munich , they shoulda never let him get away with that , they were just asking for big trouble ...
there *what* was ?
megan ?
there 's nothing to say , doctor . someone had to take the fall , and they still need you , whereas ... i 've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side , as you once said .
i was saying ... thinking maybe i 'd get my own quiz show someday , jimmy . just like you !
not all that pasta .
it 's okay with arnie ... come on , let 's go .
i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery .
i 'll never get over it .

from men , the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect . men have drained the crane 's marshes , stolen its eggs , invaded its privacy , polluted its food , fouled its air , blown it apart with buckshot .
even if we < u > could < /u > tranq him -- how would we get him on land .
well , it 's not going to work . so you 'd better go .

in our current environment , dr. weir , self-control is an asset .
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man . he was a great swordmaker , my father . and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job . he slaved a year before he was done .

do n't go telling anyone . it 'll ruin my reputation .
what do you mean ?
if you 're sayin ' you 're somethin ' better'n what i am , that 's one thing . but i ca n't say much a someone who 'd run off an ' leave a woman in a situation like this an ' feel easy about it . an ' that 's all i got ta say .

sir , you threw out page two .
endearing .
and that 's exactly what i 'm talkin ' 'bout .
i saw him last night . i thought i was dreaming . i thought i was out of my mind .

... and therafore there is no consequence ?
is this a dream ? tell me , merlin !
it 's okay . i forgive you . now , let 's say if i tell on you , i walk . and if i do n't , i go to jail .
yes sir , mr. black , a pleasure .
you do n't need to . i do n't expect you to handle them yourself .
mr. sloan ?

three nights , two days . when is your rent coming up at the motel ?
look bella , i do n't know anything about this . you should talk to matt .
now look at this fine example of early hindu art ... i do n't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
feel bad about ol ' fred . just ca n't hold back when i 'm feelin ' woolly . still , feel kinda bad . but now we 're square . anyway no use for holdin ' a grudge . i deserved a rap in the head .
ok ...
his excellency 's car !
you think you can stitch me up on you own ?
you ?
i 've got a great view up here . i can see all the --
they 're harder to do than they look .
ca n't you ?
you almost married recently , did n't you ?
well , you see , your uncle did n't bother with that sort of thing . he left everything to us . he traveled most of the time , and enjoyed himself . you should do the same thing , mr. deeds .
goodnight , ike , we 're all going to bed .
hello ...
welcome to our show !
what 'd you say , captain ?
cow tipping ?

no .
i 'm sorry , dave , but in accordance with sub-routine c1532/4 , quote , when the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it .
chef .
you have no idea what you 've done to me , do you ? and after you leave , i 'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here . if anything happened at all ! and i 'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some ... housewife 's kitchen in romania if you 'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group .
where 's that ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
i know we are . but as the years go by , we become even worse . is n't that so , corrado ?
but you did n't tell me !
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it : no credit cards , no bank accounts are in place : ten percent up front , the rest when the job is done . you . what do you do and what should we call you ?
carefull those are dirty words ! you sound like a bunch of new york critics . thank you , miss schaefer .

for not believing you .

doyle -- are you interested in solving a case , or making me look foolish ?
one minute to warp core breach .
i have heard that johnny cammareri got down on his knees in the grand ticino and proposed to her .
how do you know they 're not ?
who ?
imagine that - holding the ends of my pants !
that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois .
that 's not a lot .
yes .
as you wish , master
the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money 's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination . i feel sorry for --
all right . i 'm looking for a young fella , full of juice . about my size , wears a fancy two-gun rig .
i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
absolutely , gabrielle . someone from work ! sorry about that , gabrielle . uh-huh . exactly .
it could make weather !
you 'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main .
you saved my life .
no . maybe i believe god has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself . maybe i believe the journey , the big adventure , never ends ...
do n't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ? a million dollars is n't that much money these days .
let me help you . betty schaeter , sheldrake 's office .
i know it 's not easy . just remember , he did n't choose to be your father and you did n't choose to be his son . you just ended up together . you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it 'd be just the same . if you ask me , it 's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all .
they still hang women in canada , i 've heard .
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone .

five bucks an hour . that 's the going rate , is n't it ? it 's a quarter past two now . my wife 's picking me up at five-thirty , so that 'll give you about three hours . if you ca n't finish today , you can do the rest tomorrow .
if your husband was killed it was . this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence .
oh , must be around ten ... ten-thirty .
the order of seating at the upper servant 's table is arranged personally by the queen herself .
'cause i wan na catch her alone .

pretty soon i 'll be making a move .
i want to see you , too .
the doctors were not negligent .
do n't be fooled by appearances .
she 's in love .
i guess vernon t. waldrip is gon na be goin ' on relief . maybe i 'll be able to throw a little patronage his way , get the man a job diggin ' ditches or rounding up stray dogs .

i forgive you .
holy shit . your brother did n't tell him about the nature of our relationship , did he ?

what did he say ?
i want you to call darryl .
but sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain .

i got it all figured out , i know she went to wilson high school , so first thing tomorrow , i 'm gon na go there and get a copy of her yearbook . that way i can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were .
you can stay here .

marylin rexroth ? when does she --
when the snow melts , mon petite marquis , i suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red british soldiers .
i just want my life back ...
what 's going on ?
i told you dad , it was a question of honor . they called me chicken -- you know , chicken ! i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again . so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other . we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff . i got out okay but buzz did n't . he was killed .
stop it ! i want to read them ! if you do n't want to , then just leave . but do n't you push me around like i 'm some mule you paid for -- i already got a husband !

it 's like i 've been swimming in muddy waters .
gretchen . we 're going together now .
you 're right . i apologize . but i still want to talk to you .

sorry , captain , being held by you is n't enough to get me excited .
they do n't know you . they wo n't listen .
i 'm having trouble scanning underground . there 's a lot of radiation leaking from something .
but you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do ?
how 's that ?
i tried to call , but apparently there 's something wrong ...
i thought this was practically a done deal --

two ... maybe three .
you always think you know what i 'm going to say , do n't you ? you always think you 're two steps ahead of me . the lawyer .
well , it really was n't a vacation . you see , i 'm a teacher in the new york city school system , and i was attending a seminar on visual aids to education . are you from l.a. ?
disappointing a < u > big < /u > girl !
gabriel and his guys . what 's the last place they robbed ?

do n't worry , helmuth , it 'll be our secret .
where 's the manager ?
well , i ... i ... ah-h , let 's see ...
i ca n't ...
oh , a guy who got run out of town ...
i brought you something tonight , macfarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition .
a straight line .
i told you . if we ... you know do it , they go away until ... we 're done .
it 's my only chance !
and how long will you be away ?

you do n't have to prove anything .
i could come up with 750 grand in a day if i had a reason to .

outside hacker ? what the fuck are you talking about ?
i felt ... pain . that she 'd been hurt by someone . this is great . i 'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my --
neurologist ? why ? what 's wrong ?
president ? past presidents ! betty , this is beginning to add up .
black people getting uppity , feeding their children breakfast , taking their destiny into their own hands . what 's this world coming to ?
well ... it is his third .
buddy , i am wandering in a wilderness , lost . i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ?
we want brooklyn one hundred percent . no more taxes to you . we want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own . then we can act on all internal matters without talking . also we want you to inform michael corleone that we can deal directly with him .
it 's a method for quitting smoking .
you 're joking .
gunner 's mate , third class -- l. johnson , sir .

here , have another glass , macfarlane . i 'll take you home and we 'll be friends again -- now that you know that you 're knox 's man and my friend -- aye , forever .
no , they do n't .
once more !
no !
do n't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ?
oh , well , let 's see , there was dennis , from chippewa falls high school .
no . we 're all of us after something . it 's easy for me to fight for the common man . my father could only dream that i would be ... a general someday ? and what of my daughter or son ? i know what i 'm after . but now , with all this talk about compromise ? it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope .
i do n't believe it . wild horses would n't drag dickie to --
they certainly do . they certainly do . come , let me take you to lunch .
yeah . i 've got it here in this bag . i thought i should bring it to you .

do you remember me , i left my car , yesterday .
sweetheart --
jesus ...

you 're an innocent and an optimist david - that 's why i love you . . jesus - what a terrible tie- come on , the governor 's coming at 3. and before then i have a little surprise for you and the boss .
do you trust him ?
hey kit , where do i go for the clothes ? good stuff on < u > him < /u > .
how can they do this ?
so how can we get to it ?
why wo n't he wait until the bank closes ?
request permission to take the hood off , tommy .
and i do n't think that was tom .
what a great kite .
c'mon , beavis , just start running really fast when you hit the ground . it 'll work .
what 'd you see ?
loretta ?

i got ta ... i got ta go do a `` bunk check . '' or some fucking thing .
you do n't usually ask .
you 're still mad at me , are n't you ?
well , then i do apologize ... but what i 'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she 's feeling ... who ca n't admit when she 's wrong and who ca n't forgive when she 's not .
he 's waiting for you to mention mention .
you should n't . he likes you .
shut up and let me think .
hey , man , let 's stomp switzerland !
you mentioned on the phone that you 'd had some dizziness .
it was a dreadful , heavy thing . i only wore it this once .
well he was a boy , he was my friend ... he was my best friend . when we were kids we were gon na ... move out here and move to the brady bunch .
i did n't sign up to go home empty handed . and i sure ai n't gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this .
nick --
< u > how < /u > ?
ancient . have you finished your homework ?
my ass .
who came ?
you do .
why not tell us what you have heard ? hmm ? how much have your superiors bothered to tell you ?
he would n't kill anybody ...
and he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one . you know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker , flynne . might just as well broadcast it on the evening news .
he 'll work it off .
how big is tibet 's army ?
well ? is it just the pump ?
sir , there 's something else ... a transat relay . just came through .
sure i do . but the bet defense is a good offense , right ? you 're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game .
yeah , morgan . it 's a real rarity that we 'd be out drinkin ' .
lots of people . guy like evan twombley , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government 's been investigating his links with the mafia .
... and right in the middle of a chop , i ... i rusted solid . and i 've been that way ever since .
we need to get past them .
you do n't know the guy in the trunk , either . if it makes you feel better , he was a villain involved in a continuing criminal enterprise .
i keep seeing dan fawcett 's face . they have such big windows at the school . all the windows were broken . in dan 's bedroom . all the windows .
plague ? there 's no possibility of that , is there ?
-- but you 're father 's in there !
you do know how to drive ?
those were perfectly good fries , hamilton . perfectly good .
look , i told you i 'm not going to college .
i swear i 'll never swear again in my life if you save her life ! but i 'm warning you , if you let her die , then you 're the biggest ...
yes ?
did you report it stolen ?
no , but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day , know what i 'm saying ?
last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it , and so i decide i 'm going to make a little joke ...
i 've changed my mind again . what 's new orleans like this time of year ? mardi gras . or let 's just see where the road takes us .
under the circumstances , i ca n't fathom what makes dr. argon think we are ready for anything bigger . if c.n.n. , or hell , if the e.p.a . knew what was in my basement --
like you could n't believe .
it 's okay . this is working . this is gon na work .
in her cabana , sir .
thanks , i feel much better . listen , if you 're so bored , why did n't you go to utah with alan ?
except mark of course .
do n't tell me about what 's wrong . you come into my office as a friend and steal city files ! i could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody , that 's exactly what i 'm going to do -- and i 'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for ! you wo n't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy !
you look great .
whoo-hoo !
and you do n't know your name or who you are , that right ?
what about gale weathers ? i sound like a meteorologist ...
jesus ... go ahead .
i 'll come over when i 'm ready .
eh ? si ! avanti !
i ca n't ... not yet ...
... yes i 'm still on hold ...
no , i 'm not afraid . why ? you wan na meet her ?
bud parker and william johnson , you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency . do you admit that on the night of may 1 , you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall : red , pink , vermillion , puce , chartreuse , umber , blue , aqua , ox blood , green , peach , crimson , yellow , olive and magenta .
i do n't understand .
you 're standing on it .
what ?
every step of this goes in my report . i am now taking a manila envelope from the subject 's flight bag .
i want to touch it .
you 've known me five years elmer . when do you get to calling me david ?
what 's the frequency ?
okay , i got ta get back to work . i 'm gon na be home late . and would you try and please fill these out ?
mary . what are you doing here ?
i told you . something came up . some political dinner or something .
oh how sweet , your friend 's got his own star .
hit was right thoughty of her .
i 'm trying to tell you .
pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui ! take the van and go .
nooo . this way the rotation stays the same .
but you 'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes , where will you sleep ? i ca n't send you away from here like that !
uh ...
how long was she in there ?
okay , this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week . you remember the ...
sit .
then , close the case .
take it off and let me have a look .
no , this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
bullshit . bullshit he did n't ask you , he does n't want him , he does n't want to talk to him , so fuck you that he asked that . there is no one but me and him .
fifty-seven , fifty-eight --
that 's tough .
daddy ! where have you been ?
so where 's the art ?
and do you amuse the guests ?
i never heard that .
jail , you asshole ! our foot soldiers will blow your brains out ! bunny , ball-ball !
you were married ? all those falls , i 'm surprised you had time .
she goes on location tomorrow . sally , i 'm sorry . look , i ca n't keep her on hold .
not your fault ...
can i take him with me and have sex with his head ?
and you still haven抰 told me why you sent me after friedman .
... what ?
what 's happening ?
why does n't that surprise me ?
do n't you think we should get some tools , maybe ?
is everything okay ?
true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime .
do n't i , norman ? you kept the fucking necklace . of a woman you killed !
trust me .
was he ?
his wife . this guy says she was kidnapped last wednesday .
we 've always been here .
because i 'm tired of not understanding things . cops , mafia , and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something , which it turns out i really did n't steal -- it 's fucked up .
i 'm going to work out .
like a used car salesman .
no more . i have n't worked in four years . this town , it chews you up , then spits you out . i 'm just an ex-bogeyman . make a right .
howdy , hank .
chinatown street gang .
i did . do i have to eat lamb ? daddy did n't cook it , she did .
easy morg , do n't think about that now .
how true . but i still feel i deserve more than you do of this treasure . i mean , i found it .
just know that in this case there 's not going to be any satisfaction . if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself , if it turned out he were actually satan , then , that might live up to our expectations . no human being could do these things , right ? but , this is not the devil . it 's just a man .
vampires , my friend . vampires .
now buddy , you 're going on trial tomorrow . and if they find you guilty , you 're gon na be stuck here forever . well , not forever -- lem me think ... five year sentence ... carry the three ... that comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries , and that 's rounding down .
ah ?
what about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? there must be something to connect him with a past .
look out .
oh , babe ...
you do n't seem very cut up about it .
it 's not your fault .
i do . i remember from day one . people staring at me , sensing i was different . watching the fear grow in their eyes , knowing in their hearts i was n't human .
hope you like it . feel free to stop reading at any time . i 'll take no offense .
quince , i 've got confidence in you .
my last name is pherides .
do you , indeed . i 'll bet you do . fine . fine . we 'll save the court the time . we will admit the doctor as an 'expert witness , ' fine .
here 's the plan . you gon na call over there and say you have a very urgent message for mr. william jones .
not you must n't touch . your mama might not like you handling knives .
i have ?
no , it 's just ... no one 's ever said that . and i thought if someone did ever say it , i 'd have to say it first and then they 'd sort of say `` i love you too '' cause they felt they had to after i 'd said it .
ibm .
i told you i should 've cuffed him .
sulu !
kinda ' .
is there a phone booth there ?
it 's all so complicated .
well , uh , i do n't , it 's really --
very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness . one of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death , a sense of stifling and drowning , and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees . alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket .
that 's how you score now ?
i do n't know , honey . i guess it would depend .
come on . inside .
you change partners , you change the rules .
yeah , sometimes . i like to dabble , too .
where did you hear about this ? whose been talking about these things ?
we 're outta here !
there seems to be some confusion about your registration . i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador . many persons of the jewish faith find it quite ...
have i noticed anything ? i 'm not married to her benjamin , you are . i think you 've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her .
maybe you 'll be . you 're a smart young man . you let hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $ 100,000.00 insurance policy for me . what do you say ?
hi tom .
i do n't need sleep !
write down drexl 's address .
how long where you and dis guy goin ' steady ?
you 're insane !
that 's my opinion .
why does n't dexter show some decency ? and you might show some too , mother . what do you expect a man to do when he 's called such names ? i 'm glad you hit that reporter , stewart . he deserved it .
it seems human . to me .
it does n't quite add up .
i make it six .
sure . hey , toby . you grew up
you had to , yeah . why ?
goodbye .
sound good to you , danny ?
you tell lies , dad . you tell amusing lies . stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime . they 're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty . and the thing is , i believed you . i believed your stories so much longer than i should have . and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything ! -- i felt like such a fool to have trusted you . you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined . just as charming and just as fake .
i thought by giving away the sword , i could escape the giang hu world . but the cycle of bloodshed continues .
make a left at this corner .
she thought you were money .
huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
i know so . he , them , they 're not to be trusted .
perhaps a little refreshment first ? a little coffee , or a little chocolate ?
i 'm trying to be , dad . i 'm tyrin ' . it 's good to hear your voice . i missed you ... so much .
i only desire what gives you pleasure , my dearest .
pretty , ai n't it ? you a plumber ?
anyway you want it , asshole .
yeah , we 're drunk . we 're the drunks . what 's your name ?
an even five i throw in the jacket .
oh .
what do you want from me ?
you think this was to hurt you ? ! my god , joe . it is n't about you .
did your wishes ever come true ?
l.a. is in a constant state of warfare . gangs fighting for the right to rule .
inspector , will you confirm somebody is copying the boston strangler ? this is the fourth , is that correct ?
you saved me .
*you wo n't ? *
look , mattie , i know you're-
joey , what 's more important , the kids ' clothes or your sexual potency .
the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed . i think she was crying ...
i see a ring on your finger . you have any kids ?
dance ?
oh , excuse me . i was just tryin'梱ou know梩o make things pleasant .
trouble with the car again ?
for what ?
yeah ?
a channel . it 's just a little further down the dial , that 's all . look , it 's publicity . publicity 's publicity . right ?
litterbug .
then have the lab check raspail 's head . dr. lecter 's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues ... they 'll find another cocoon .
i 'm sorry , too . well , nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and , ben , i want to thank you for your time and thoughts .
good evening . forest service .
i do n't understand .
you 're playing this as close to the edge as any man , i 'll give you that . we might just have to sign articles , you and i. jack , you 're a pirate at heart , that 's certain .
i 've never mentioned it to him .
need i ask who 's favored to collect at the end of this week .
you 're talking to me .
gabe .
what ? what is it ?
it might 've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship .
he 's right about the ear , it 's hacked off .
i dunno ... i just like don knotts .
there 's just one thing . what about --
you get rid of her .
how much of that story is true ?
now put down the key -- -- and put down the address .
i抦 not as square as my daughter thinks .
you just dropped a shitload on him ... give him some time to digest it .
i want to make it up to you . bluestar , put all your clients in it .
that 's not the reason i 'm here . i swear it .
and what 's that ?
why ?
she 's nobody you should be concerned with .
did he say where ?
being as close , i 'm certain you 've noticed what we all have noticed .
hi , thorn .
no . that 's not why ... why we always got ta do this ? i mean , you and me been at each other as far back as i can remember . was n't no love between us . and i 'm your daughter . i 'm the only family you got .
drive ! drive ! !
if we were at 10th street pool you woulda done it right in the water , right ?
that 's okay . lloyd 's really the one teaching the class .
yeah . who are you ?
what about you , doyle ? who 's the best fighter you ever seen ?
okay ... idea . compromise , right ? bruno here comes with me . he holds the money until mommy shows up , then we close escrow . what you do with her after i 'm gone does n't keep me awake nights .
but ... my plan involves all four of us acting together .
thank you .
i 'm sorry for what i said about wally needing you . it was ... unnecessary .
paul rusesabagina , mr. godefroid . the house manager . i met you on your last visit .
we ca n't just leave them here .
i 'm going to daikanyama , do you want to come walk around ?
i do n't see where that 's any of your business .
are n't you going to get that ?
you do n't care about me and you definately do n't care 'bout your son .
promised i 'd turn my back while he ... ah , never mind ...
did you see mr. marsh the day before his death ?
i 'm not suffering , you know . i do n't give a shit .
you said the `` s '' word .
oh , dear .
danny witwer is scheduled for a tour of containment tomorrow --
hello-o-o ...
include me out . i 've had enough of the conversations .
i was wondering if i could talk to you ?
no . prison is time . that 's it . you think time , you feel time , you hear time . your heart does n't beat to live , it just beats ... time .
they 'll in validate the key . probably nothing .
shit , if you 're on a crazy jag , why stop there , why not take fort knox with a fucking slingshot or go into hell after hitler ... i like your chances a lot more .
and ... ?
let 's find a telephone .
your supervisors have no idea why you 're here .
you do ?
but we have no choice ! we 've got , to take them out !
they use ' to be a sayin ' : a chile born outa sorrow 'll be a happy chile . an ' another : born outa too much joy 'll be a doleful boy . that 's the way i always heard it .
go !
you 're back .
on the telly . we 're to film him for the evening news .
well , gentlemen ... how about a little lunch ?
you are , lewis . you rolling ?
do i look okay ?
yes , sir . our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational . the invasion happens eight days later .
are you free tonight ?
fan-fucking-tastic ?
a number for the whole group , or for us ?
that 's because we want a chance to observe them . this is the only place we 've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them . what happens here will be a guide to all other operations . the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops , i 'll get my report to washington . you 've deployed your forces well .
comfortable ?
let 's review these notes for your testimony . we have a big day on monday .
just a little skid , that 's all . this road 's like glass .
it 's compensation , leo , for the marginal life we lead . sidney , did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
... plenty
one chance to tell the truth , tommy . who is the man with the scar ? he planted this in my car .
zoe , come say hello to your father ...
well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much . go in and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father to father lawrence to make confession and be absolved .
the hoop-dee-doo !
they do smell . some of them smell.. babies smell .
what am i gon na eat ?
how are the lessons going ? ada nods enthusiastically . he 's getting on all right ? ada nods again good .
maybe it is n't going to sonora , but it 's going somewhere , which is all right with me .
of telling you .
yeah ! yeah ! ! ! man i 'm getting so hot ! ! !
good quality porn has it 's place in the world .
you said it was over , right ? you said not to worry any more , all over , right ?

what 's he looking for ?
psychology .
does n't matter ... .
how young ?
what 's that ?
it was a very impressive offer . fancy offices , a big home ... i 'd be treated like a king .
no ... it 's just ...
gift certificates to kentucky fried chicken .
totally .
i forgot where i put my keys .
did you have a dream ?
certainly not to me .
he is the great one ...
what can we do for you , officers ? what new , mindless harassments have you planned this morning ?
what was that for ?
then it was not a sin . but what was that second thing you said , loretta ?
listen ... you want to get a drink ? i got a new place . or we could go to a bar ... well , maybe not a bar . but i know a place uptown , if you want --
we should set up a cuban defense fund on this ; take care of all of them .
i will not have them on my conscience . they will stay in my room .
does n't look like it . we 're damned lucky . this statue is priceless .
coming in this week , week after . everybody going to get well .
`` dowd also reports that his team of private investigators ... '' ?
you can talk to me ...
do n't get mad , but i just went for a little stroll through the company switches .
rennie ... what 'd they do to you ? ?
sir , congress has n't issued their pay for two months , many have not eaten properly for at least that long . you 're being a little hard on them , do n't you think ?
i want women .
it is not mr. demille in person . it is someone by the name or gordon cole . he says it 's very important .
oh , is it ? buddy boy , in this business if people do n't produce , they get fired .
like de prophets say , `` only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman . ''
why ?
of course i think about it every day .
hello , herman , it was a happy landing , i see .
business or personal ?
wait a minute . wait a minute . matt , do you realize you 're up against something ? you 're being charged with murder . it 's serious , son . now come on , i know you did n't do it . but we 've got to make them believe it . come on , tell the truth , where were you last night ?
no ! gosh ! i better get moving here , miss saunders -- everybody else calls you just plain `` saunders . '' why ca n't i ?
dickie and peter , that 's just too good gossip , is n't it ?
i 'd like that very much .
will ... ?
sneaking in the back door .
all right , what do you need .
this is before the accident , nicole . do you understand what i 'm asking ?
why , i do n't know .
please ?
listen , mr. martins , if you 'd agree to be our guest , we 'd be delighted to have you .
sshhh . `` after going through the safety deposit box , i 'm sure you 'll find you 're way to this letter . it 's hard to write this to my own children . i could let this die with the rest of me , i suppose . but as one gets older , one fears subside . what becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay . row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were . it 's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it 's something that just happens . i do n't know if it 's as simple for children . you 're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong . but i thought it was important to give you that chance . to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was ... ''
those are good burgers , walter .
do n't you think it 's sick ?
i suppose she is very entertaining ... it must be lots of fun to be with her , so witty , so glamorous ...
michael - you loved that house as a child . you could work again ! you could make it ours . we 'll sweep out the horror . and lasher with it !
bill , i 'd like you to meet vivian .
oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they 'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i do n't think you
really ? for most people it 's a rather pleasant experience . what exactly did you ...
how do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions ?
i received my b.s . from the university of pennsylvania , my p.h.d . from bryn mawr college . i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine , during which time i had articles printed in the `` journal of educational psychology '' , `` american journal of psychology '' , `` psychology review '' and `` science '' ... so i think it 's safe to say my opinion is valid .
-- a fucking cop .
all this is for us ?
you 're kidding . when for ?
you 're stalling , verbal .
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me .
yes , maude , it is . it is a < u > very < /u > good play .
and yet you 're willing to die for this cause , the one thing that 's given your life a sense of purpose . do n't you see the contradiction here -- ?
never mind about that . you 've got to promise me you wo n't say a word to anybody .
would you like some ?
beats me .
what 's wrong ? what 's happening ?
ask me the questions , bridgekeeper . i am not afraid .
well , at his age , twenty payment life , a little over a thousand dollars .
when might that be ?
i do n't know .
you oughta try on the problem i got in here .
what do you believe in ?
you okay ?
they never hurt me ? they hurt me every day with their attitude . you know , like they even have a right . who the fuck do they think they are ? let me tell you something , i was born here . alright ? i 'm an american . and i 'm owed something . look , they took it from me .
i ca n't !
i 'll call you later and we 'll get together and plan your curriculum .
look at the bottom of the screen . you see the icon with the arrow pointing left ? click on that ... twice .
the big hurt , huh ?
no . i have n't . have you ?
he < u > also < /u > said we 'd avoid that storm in space . and we know how that turned out .
is it december ?
the women are armed , hal . this is standard . now you stay calm here . these boys know what they 're doin ' .
barely living , from the looks of it .
well , what about , oh , you know , maybe a saturday ?
it was a place to start .
they all start to look the same once you 've worked in one . am i right , sister ?
that 's just too bad --
we want da vinci 's sketchbook , what do they call it , the codex .
let 's get some power here .
have you broken it yet ? we 've got six more heads and that means six more hours .
can we eat him , uncle birdie ?
the hell is this shit ?
what 's nicky doing down there ?
luke , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why do n't you take the weekend ... ... that way you 'll be there , and i 'll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .
he said he would be there with bells on .
uh . annabelle 's video report has been switched again .
unwelcome ? i guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
sounds more like aids ...
oh , no , not at all . and then you know very well that he 'll forgive you anything ; just as long as you admit to him that you 're a worse driver than he is ...
you have elected me security . the way things have been going in this barracks , i guess i 've done a poor job and i want to make up for it . is that asking too much ?
okay , do n't stop .
you love her , but you hate her ?
are you absolutely sure ?
never , what ? !
i 've already formulated a plan .
i expect we 'll have to gatecrash .
... where ?
because it was going to fall .
what ? why ?
sure allan , i 'll be there .
yes , miss gibson . i 've come to take you to your sister .
i 'll give you a chance , dyle -- which is more than you 'd give me . where 's the money ?
why do they burn the villages ? there 's nothing to gain .
oh , i miss you . you look beautiful .
yes . i suppose it 's possible .
i must admit there are times i do n't understand human behavior .
`` a.d . ''
i do n't do that .
i heard about your son . i 'm sorry .
i heard sir te lost something . and now madame te 's not feeling well ...
let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking .
driving , talking to me ...
ah ... no ...
madame , if you ...
you 're such a beautiful man . look at you - stuck in this place , and only thinking of her .
fine . how was the match ? did you loose ?
i do n't even like turkey sandwiches . what kind of pizza ?
what is it -- i ca n't tell anything --
nick , he just came back .
what ? daniel , i wan na go upstairs .
yes . and congratulations to all of you . it was superb .

we got the wire ya was comin ' . you 're the indian official , yeah ?
what happened ? he ai n't dead ? what 's goin ' on ?

nothing is real until it 's perceived .
where is it ?
sir !
my undying love . have some .

i know . tell me something . do you think she 's going to make it all the way this time ?
the truth can kill , my friend . five hundred men died out there . this is n't a story they 'd ever want out . when paul 's car blew up i realized the scope of the thing . i knew they meant business .
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
you 'd make it . he 's just getting to the girls . come on , zack . i got ta see my family , man . i could n't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend .

something on your mind , lisa ?
an ' you say no cops ?
she was born without a tongue .
well , at least i know what to name him . i do n't suppose you 'd know who the father is ? so i do n't tell him to get lost when i meet him .
here you are .
you 've got a midnight matinee .
get back in there .
who 's ... lieuten --
stay as long as you like .
they wo n't allow that . it 's one at a time . and you have to be first .
if he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby ?
i better do this , stan .
your unfaithfulness -- that 's what i 'm trying to talk about . your unfaithfulness . your betrayal . your dalliance . and you wo n't do me the dignity of being up front about it .
first you can grab that black- haired woman and make her your own .
hey ... you 're here . they told me you 're here ... and you 're here . how are you ?
i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch . see , i was doing really good up till then . lots of street busts . i 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . i got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . next thing i know , the mayor 's pinning a medal on me . picture in the paper , whole nine yards .
and my nose ...
yes -- i 'm sorry -- i had to leave ... i did n't want to disturb you .
the only place i do n't bring my drugs is church . and that ai n't till sunday morning .
... i had a dream about ... something like that .
jeffrey ! !
you always had a way with words . i should be getting back .
i missed you at the funeral home . santos said you were here .
yes , you are , when i was straightening up the couch , you know what i found ? six hairpins , a lipstick , a pair of false eyelashes , and a swizzle stick from the stork club .
what 's the problem ?
'could n't convince teddy to come ?
leave it , ann .
i apologize for going on like this . it 's the sunday painter in me . of course i can understand your refusal . it 's a great deal to ask of someone .

pitcher . `` best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk . ''
we would like vincent to have a brother ... you know , to play with .
you mean , leaving his wife ? yeah . i 'm very happy for you .

thank you . do you work in the building ? you coming from the party ?
girl 's got ta make a living .

lady van tassel .
i know how responsible , caring adults parent children . i 'm bribe 'em . but 'em a dog or something . maybe a doberman .

i mean that in our 'primitive ' civilization , apes just do n't talk . i mean i think it 's important that , when our 'primitive ' security precautions are lifted , the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively ' call the right people .
new course ? you have no authority . what 's going on here ?
mr. lundegaard , that very well may be . i must inform you , however , that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon , i will have to refer this matter to our legal department .

sorry .
i 'm , sorry , but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues . i 've seen so many corpses rolled away ... unrevenged .

that 's daddy !
that 's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken . the fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style ... much to the chagrin of your mother ... who is so clearly ashamed of you . imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you wo n't just tell the truth about what really happened . < b > ext . nevada desert -- day for night [ mescaline trip ]
where the hell are you ?
go learn something .
oh , thank you .
i hope it 's not the oven again .
i said ten thousand .
a man named tim ma- ...
i can see your small business ! look at it it 's so small .
hi
when i last saw you , i was unprepared . i did not know what to expect . in these past weeks , i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . you have to understand who i am and what i am . i am a musician and i believe in music . i am an artist and i believe in art . art in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man 's spiritual needs . i must confess , however , to being extremely naive . i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . my entire life was devoted to music because , and this is very important , because i thought that i could , through music , do something practical .
you 're an extraordinary man .
no , you said i should get my degree . i like my `` bullshit '' job , okay , and it 's gon na lead to a spot in the front office . til then , do n't worry , there 's just enough savings to keep your ass in gucci and gold .
that 's weird .
thanks .
excellent performance , my friend . the judge was very impressed .
it will be very dramatic .
i 'm ok .
should i hit it ?
no , i never saw him before in my life .
it 's a long story , but yeah , more or less .
i said be cool , all right ? now be cool !
you 're prone to violent outbursts , are n't you ?
why should they ?
then this is a goddamn emergency .
hey . this is looking good ! paul , where 's the octopus motor ?
honey -- alcoholics anonymous takes all the time i 've got -- and harold ryan is an individual i would rather forget . he drove me to drink . he drove his first two wives to drink .
well , i guess it 's getting late . please thank kathryn for the use of her steinway .
my dear princess , the human soul is a highly elusive commodity . i suggest you spend some hours before the glass . contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul .
still lives with his mother .
no ...
at pee dee , all you think about is the future , you know ? gettin ' out ? and what you 'll do and what you 'll think about when you 're on the outside again .
what are you doing here ? !
to finish last evening 's delightful work .
a dog .
save it .
yes ?
hey , man , you 're not from here . you do n't know how it is . i grew up in l.a ...
it 's for you .
and right next to it , that oval design with the markings -- it 's a dead ringer for the spore casings .
then i will respectfully take leave of her .
so what 's his reason ?
get anything ?
you would n't live out the week .
you 're not interested in him ?
you have to call the police ...
sure is a hairy fellah .
i knew this was going to happen .
i 'm sorry . tanner , do n't you want some wine ?
sounds like chickenshit --
you must hate your brothers .
a coyote .
the brakes are shot .
officer all sleep now , yes ? and i go wash clothes .
edie , edie , i ...
you sure ... ?
this is n't fair , you know . do you always get what you want ?
can i ask you a question ?
you son of a bitch , you think you can brush me off like that ? i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders .
it 's barry .
seriously , merv , everything is great . i was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend , maybe going up to the mountains .
where 's thea ?
guys ready to order ?
i still do n't see how i 'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment . everyone will think i did it .
shit , what i have now made our setup in angola look like tinker toys . i 've been skipping through internal revenue records all day . i even have video strip poker . you want to check it out ?
but you have a vision . do n't you want to help your parents ?
you 're gon na be singing for st. peter if you do n't get your ass out of here !
so what am i going to do ! get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the world can get his beauty fucking sleep !
one of yours ?
the material world is an illusion . it does n't matter if they 're there or not . the world is in my head .
yes ?
they 're still there !
half mile up , there 's a clearing .
i have n't seen him in two years .
she knew what she was signing on for after all , she took the money .
what ten thousand pounds ?
go on .
how does she know ?
she 's making it up ! my father was professor --
except you .
everybody , they , they , they treat me like a ...
shoulda written to that magazine , rudy . i 'm gon na walk outta here , walk right into a relationship . not some one-nighter , man ... a relationship . you ? you 're gon na walk outta here with bus fare . searching for the drunkest skirt in the room .
i mean , you did lose a lot of nice , neat little shit . the trendy paper lamps , the euro-trash shelving unit , am i right ?
i 've been thinking about things . meditating on my financial future . you guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future . whatja do , stop for chinese on the way over ? there 's plenty of food in my place .
right . you 're right .
it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose .
so you 're just going to be vindictive
i get it . we could give the public the impression that we were doing something ... charitable . brilliant ! !
i think i came . did n't you feel it ?
i 'm telling you , i got definitive evidence --
is the plaintiff ready ?
hang in there .
what 's the matter with you ?
it does n't matter what he 's going through . that 's the whole purpose of this zoo . what matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that ca n't ever happen again .
i have to say 'behind ' ! i get shocked if i say 'ass- ow ! ! !
back it down , johnny !
oh , yeah .
yeah , now go uhn , uhn , uhn !
is there no chance ?
yeah , i give a shit .
i 'm not gon na throw you out , bernie .
dorsey .
back at the door -- i asked you to back away .
sure ! i got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more ... he retired , you know .
i don韙 think so .
lonnie elam said never to go up there . lonnie elam said that 's a haunted house . he said real awful stuff happened there once .
do n't piss him off , o'neal . when he gets like this , i ca n't control him . i 've seen this before . he got like this once -- i saw him jerk a guy 's spine out and show it to him . nothing i could do . i hadda go throw up .
sort of half ... ..
i 'll have to talk to the driver .
yeah ! them .
do you still have to do homework ?
do you think that 's what he wants ?
be quiet , boy . i 'm thinking . it ca n't be done at the house . it should be . . .
me and mr. orange jumped in the car and mr. brown floored it . after that , i do n't know what went down .
my father built the house where i was born with his own hands . oh , it was n't a big house ...
i aimed high .
you know where you 're taking me . you know what she 'll do . just give me a minute , slow down , give me an instant for once in your life , please ?
we did n't do so bad after all .
i was one of those silent , listening children . glued to the shadows .
preparation for what ?
that 's compared to , like , earthquakes in the far east or testicular cancer ?
how do you know that ?
what 're we going to do ?
i want you out of town before the hanging .
out of kindness .
carlotta valdes ?
why should they find out ? it 's only two thousand dollars , bloom , do me a favor , move a few decimal points around . you can do it . you 're an accountant . the word 'count ' is part of your title .
you mean twombley ?
the mountains are solid granite . we 'd be safe there , and we could hike along them ... all the way to bixby if we have to .
it 's exactly what you meant .
you came up my river -- in that small boat . so simple . i always thought the final justice would come from the sky , like we did . you are the final justice , are n't you ?
we 'll be there .
no . it 's strong . but i like it that way .
you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?
some weirdo who likes to wear dresses .
your word is so good , you 're never gon na give it to anyone .
no - but mr. rand does have one with an electric motor , that way he can get around by himself .
ooh , honey , i 'm ready ! now ! now !
he is in love . his anger is gone .
what 's that ?
captain , i 'm getting a message from klingon high command .
under a cloud without cause , i take it .
unlike you , i have a class in forty- five minutes .
you really had me going , claire . i was finally ready to propose to you .
that 's all past , lestat .
the hell you know about me ? ! you got no right to talk to me about that shit ! the hell you think you are ?
alex ?
the moron ?
yes , yes . it would be interesting . a nice cheer .
oh , now --
do what you must .
he did n't look unhappy !
cowardly bastard . i 'm in handcuffs and i still scare the piss out of you .
see me , sir ?
it 's hard to explain , but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension .
i know , uncle , you 've told me that already .
this is easy .
let 's say ... for instance ... i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino ... to get one of those sandwiches i like ?
you 're wrong . do you know i knew how to play this ?
he came tearing around the corner , out of control --
[ beat ] listen , i hate to bother you ...
ted , i loved you and i 'll always love you . but i need simon . he 's stable . he 's a good provider . i want that at this stage of the game , ted . he might have his faults , but simon does n't know the meaning of the word fear and i need that in a man .
destroy the evidence huh .
i do n't know who i am ! i still do n't know !
mr.- taupin , what were you doing in that alley ?
i was invited . what 's your story ?
i 'll do anything ... face any challenge !
i 've never seen your place .
why does she come to you ?
i was half hoping i would n't have a good time tonight . you know why ?
no , we 're just going down .
what ! ?
sid found me the icepack .
do n't touch me !
i 've already asked them . they 're afraid to make the trip . we 'll have to send an expedition back after them .
you mutant bastards ...
did you call the police ?
in the garage .
i understand that . i 'm sorry to hear that . we 'd be well advised to deal with this situation now . the insurance company - -
... he 's right here , mr. mayor ...
is she not here ?
okay ... why do n't we light candles on friday ? let 's light candles ... . and say the kaddish .
but for catherine martin , it all comes down to you and lecter . you 're the one he talks to .
is he not going ? i booked a flight .
yes , he is .
he 's been like that for awhile . we need to get him some medicine .
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day , it 's liable to create a false impression .
you ? you think i do n't get that ? god , it 's like just because i do n't get drunk and barf every weekend , people say `` oh , here 's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss . ''
it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you . you 've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun , i might note . there 's no glory to it , but there are those that like it .
well , ill tell you this . i have learned a lesson tonight . i was n't gon na run around , but when i start botherin ' your daddy and worse robbin ' a cradle , i got ta face the facts of life . tomorrow mornin ' , i 'm gon na get myself up and go out .
i realize this is a shock .
my wife told me to expect you . as you know , i have n't talked to the press .
our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
a fresh shirt ...
feathers all over the place ... .
how are you ?
give it to me .
boy !
there 's no *real* ship as can match the interceptor .
what 's this ?
he was curious from birth - premature by two weeks , as if he could n't wait to get started .
that 's for sure . at the airport - that 's where it was . at the airport , there in one of those gift shops ... anyway , you better take a break .
mmmm , no . not a good idea .
stay here .
it just is n't .
we need a new name for the movie . where 's the writer ?

mary . mary , we 've got to get going .

thank you .
nothing .
quiet , mollie , quiet !
... he wants to testify ... ?
he 's my father .
hey , vasquez ... you ever been mistaken for a man ?
a coward ... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity . you offend me .
how can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and ... who are you ? were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table ? tell me ! please tell me who you are ; you own me that !
fuck .
are you with me ... or against me ?
jani ! where are you ?

they call him `` the sand spider '' . *
purely a precaution ...

yeah . that 's right , jocko . those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them .
i was acting in the town 's best interests ...
who do you work for ?
and die laughing , because you 're walking so stupid !
i guess ...
shut up ! ! !
is it ? is it really ?
and his parents ?
do you really think so ?
right .
but what ?
why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !

no ...
pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .

it 's like a song .
i mean , it 's not a problem or anything , but -- i 'm just a little unclear on what those things are . i thought maybe you 'd know .
how 'd you get in here ?
his mother 's an only child .

motherfuckers ...
she 'd invaded my support groups , now she 's invading my home .
kamal is not here . we are very defused .
you son-of-a-bitch ...
what 's it like being a superhero ? it must be frightfully exciting..how did you guys all get together ?
... it 's ... like a giant strobe light , burning right through my eyes ... but somehow i can still see . look , you know the dream 's the same every night , why do i have to --
yes , sir ... but , do you have these ?
i 'm not the one to ask ...
you 're beginning to sound like mr. kirkeby already .
but i survived . and i still have that single shot . it 's meant for one man . my mutinous first mate --
let 's see if they have an address for becker . i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with .
yes ! !
i 'm suspicious of men who want to marry . i believe they think it 's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers .
the nsa 's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40 's . they 've infected everything : banks , computers , phones , mail , name it . the more technology we buy into , the easier it is keeping tabs on us . it 's a brave new world . at least it better be .
the same .
not you ?
do n't worry , we 'll get it ...
no . i was living with you , remember ? we 've slept together but we have n't made love . not yet . but i 'll tell you one thing . the sleeping together is better .
okay , penis , that 's one , balls ...
show-off .
we might as well start a fire .
are you going to be happy here , mr. james ? without all that excitement ?
and the fact that they say it 's made out of pure gold , makes no nevermind to you , right ?
one thing bothers me ... that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he 's lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what 's your daughter on ?
it 's registered in my mother 's name .
... me , too .
they are here ! ... your jewels ! ... here in paris !
yes .
what do you want , hun ?
sure i do . there was some kind of mutiny on the base , and you killed general ripper .
make them talk and you got williams , pinky !
you think my dad 'll figure out why he 's not getting better ?
hey . hey . if you do n't mind , use the back stairs , all right ?
thanks for the halo , james , but i 've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever .
what 's to stop you ? saunders will help you with it --
you are , silly . he 's a bad sheriff .
heat is heat .
where ?
maybe it 's being polished or something . maybe they 're cleaning it .
are you sure ? i really appreciate it .
did n't want you .
i do n't know . [ beat ] i thought i was crazy after you left that day . i died . i still think i could be crazy . but then i replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it i could remember -- and it was like ... i do n't care if i was , or am . i have n't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life . [ beat ] and when you left , all i wanted was ...
hey ! fuckin ' a ! just ... just like a hot shit ... except cold .
but where did you come from ?
oh , i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56 , '57 when i lived down in the quarter .
`` most smartest ? '' oh , that 's good , loretta . make sure you get a picture of that . `` most smartest . '' we 're cuttin you off and sendin ' you home .
i probably would n't be able to get to them if i tried ...
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store . you see , i had n't planned on spending much time here .
oh , do n't be such a fucking hypocrite . i quit smoking , did n't i ?
do n't act so goddamned innocent ! you and your own mother , gah ! you like to go back where you been , huh ?
you are not allowed to act this way .
you 're a little boy and you like to be bad .
that 's not what i saw .
i do n't pimp that . you talkin ' about who i think you talkin ' about , you mean rae . rae doole . sexy little split tail , like you say . i ca n't hook you up with that . i got two girls . one ai n't in town , the other one pregnant . so ... you on your own .
no . poached . over .
cole , what the hell are you doing ?
i do n't know their real names .
yes , baron .
every cent of it , and it still was less than we owe .
last time , it was me against him . i was n't strong enough ... alone .
i know this is the first time we 've been apart since . but everything 's gon na be okay .
whoever , i look , maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head . i'ii meet you back at the motel .
wait ...
nothing is what i said ! go on , kill me . kill me . i 'm not afraid of you anymore . i do n't care if you kill me like you 're killing him . you 're a sick animal .
do you play ?
right through the brainpan . deader'n dogshit , boss .
that is the point ... and skipper 'll slip off the hook .
then i have come to the right place .
why am i here , mr. hadden ?
yeah . now , when you feel like you 're confident , ...
ooohh , nothing . i just got fired , that 's all .
how long is it so far ?
short pieces , huh ? you should try to write songs .
no , straight up .
janet ! oh ! yes it 's alright . janet . everything 's going to be alright .
peter , i ... i ...
a figure of st. sebastian .
i do n't think that 's going to happen .
i never said that .
christ , stephen , let 's wait for the hose team ...
you really look better .
oh , i 've got stories , believe me . they 're a little more risque than tales of band camp .
sure you do --
well you 're telling your teachers and your friends --
where do you think you 're going ?
now ! tell everyone to dump !
yes ? lee a couple of blocks from here . if you do n't know about it , you should . you 'd really love it .
let me see that .
no ... sharp -- you look great .
are they following us ?
y'know what , guys ? i woke up this morning , i got a really lucky feeling going on . i mean it , i 'm feeling that good . i would n't be surprised if i walk in there , pull a handle and hit jackpot . hell , we would n't even have to --
i know that mr. sayer .
leopard skin ...
sergeant ? we thought you were ...
oh ! you mean gay old bohemian days of gay old san francisco ! the juicy stories ? like who shot who in the embarcadero august , 1879 ?
mac , did you ever find out who molly went off with ?
i 'm real sorry . in a while , you 're gone from this country . but we live here . no one wants to mix it up with those hombres .
who ? who came ?
i mean , if i ca n't work in vegas , where am i gon na go ?
coninued
look at that < u > detail < /u > !
i 've got to go --
that 's all ?
we 're getting there . because in his so-called construction job , tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called `` the hole . ''
why did n't you bring him ?
given a malfunction , how would a rescue team get you out if the doors wo n't open ?
george sanders ?
if you grab a gatorade , then everybody 's going to grab one .
when did you ever work in an office ?
seventy ... eight .
how many is that , six ? pretty hungry , were n't you ?
i hope you like it .
that road can be a bad one at night , melanie .
it wo n't do any good . they are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out .
thought of everything have n't you .
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant ?
you can . you 're full of ideas . you just need to squeeze one out .
there 's nothing stopping you .
sure it is . freckle face , if i ever handled a minor felon like that , it 'd be all over the papers . i 'd catch hell . and this is the alleged murderer of the president ?
bowling was the most incorruptible sport . no megalomillionaires , no
well , it 's not really my job to please . hope you learned something .
how sad . stuffed and mounted , eh ? dead men , like sunken ships , can tell no stories . and his other companion ?
`` yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe shine dim , before the blazing of a single thought -- ``
he said , and these were his words , he < u > valued < /u > our time together , because i was civil .
-- i tried , y'know ? helen 's right . i do n't have all the answers , but goddamn it , i 've got some . look , you 're gon na do what you have to , and maybe i should n't have gotten in the way . i 'm your brother , not your father . go on . you got ta go somewhere ? go ...
so what do i say to this guy ?
do n't worry .

to be on the safe side . i mean --
i 'm just nervous . sorry .
ca n't be thinkin ' bout him every second of my day . i 'll go outta my gourd .
jesus christ , ann . why is anybody anything ? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad , and you do n't allow for any gray areas , and that 's what most of us consist of .
are we good ? yeah , we 're good . we 're beautiful . we 're perfect . this is a grade , one-hundred percent pure colombian cocaine , ladies and gentlemen . disco shit . pure as the driven snow . good riddance .
i thought i recognized you . you 're paul benjamin the writer , are n't you ?
`` happy birthday , wanda june ! ''

i 'm a little cold .
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games .
what , aliens ?
you mean because you thought i was cocky i抦 now on a permanent acid trip ? ! !
rhodes , you and i had a roll in the hay together when i first got here . it was a wholly unsatisfying experience which i do not want to , and which i never will repeat ! so give up , mister ! i 'm going home ... to that roommate you mentioned .
with what just happened upstairs --
caviar capital of the world . matchless beluga . firm , yet subtle . largest landlocked body of water on earth . oil-rich . hitler wanted it . stalin beat him to it .
do you know this my lady ?
your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated .
maybe we should call the coast guard .
we 're going sightseeing -- are n't we , asta ?
of course i know --
you wo n't have the chance . any further words of encouragement ? then i 've a train to catch .
but your people ... neri ... rocco ; you do n't think ...
whatsamatter with you ? are you crazy ?
you 're perfect for me , too .

leonard .
... be responsible for you in the streets .
then you got no excuse for living . what the hell you doin , being buddies with this creep , beni ? what 's in it for you ?

i will offer that report . well , then , now that your memory seems to be clearing , can you tell us what else you observed at that time ?
pleasure first if it do n't interfere with business .
i 'm not myself since i stopped smoking .
let me speak to ellen ... .
bluebeard !
do n't want to talk to梔o n't want to talk to anybody . do n't want to see anybody .
what do you mean ? it does n't get to look much better than that ?
yeah feels like it .
you look good .
what 's going on ?
you do it .
get it .
then what ?
rich . reclusive . bankrolls half a dozen charities .
think about what i said . i mean , if you want to experiment , or whatever --
and i said we did n't .
do n't i know it . come on in agent rodgers . sit down . always a ... pleasure to see you . how can i be of help ?
when are you leaving ?
you 're taking us to that holding cell now . all right , cut !
i ca n't believe no one called back . i better ...
and who else did i find ? agent thomas mackelway , crackerjack fbi techie . i was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned .
oh , it 's definitely better , beyond question . a fatherless child , an ignorant girl with no job , no money , no home . it 's fortunate , a blessing really , and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you .
got ta get that chain off her , laz . somethin ' like this gets out , you could land in a heap of trouble .
we 're makin ' moves on each other .
ecology . folks use that term for everything but what it means : who 's eating who .
so josh , if this guy freaks out , will you protect us ?
we were just talking about him .
oh , well .
your heart .
he gambles ... he likes a good time ... i see him around ... .
how 's it going ?
you said we do appearances together , or not at all . '
is that a threat , dr. bright ?
they know about that gadget . i 'd worry more about the radio .
there 's not going to be a viewing . i figured with the kids and all ...
yeah , thanks .
what 's that , lilly ?
yeah ?
i 've considered that .
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
thank you , captain pierce . it 's been so long .
no . but i love them just the same .
now , what did we steal ?
get off me !
yes . he 's a diamond in the rough . and i have a feeling that someday soon you 'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough .
get rid of them .
i did n't stutter . take care of your responsibilities . y'know exactly what i 'm talking about .
did n't the family get together last night -- ?
i 'll come straight there .
a nap wo n't help . i 've been awake for too long -- three or four nights . i ca n't even remember . if i go to sleep now , i 'm dead for twenty hours .
no , it just struck me as odd ... i do n't see you for all these years and you 've still got the same tape stuck in the box .
sandro ... a month is too long a time . i have become used to being without you .
i 'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area , mr. president , given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
no , he did not ! we are a loving supportive family , mr. stubbins .
you never could have kept this from me .
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ?
what are doing , bond ? trying to impress this innocent thing ?
yes .
some classy tub in it 's day , huh ?
may i come in ?
exception !
that 's how a man would do it . i 'm not a man .
something like that , yes .
i 'm sorry , but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland . you know how she loves to ski .
do n't worry . fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open . perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian . i just put this on for sentiment . the rest are absolutely safe . i assure you . but if you feel like notifying the police ...
excuse me . what part of no do n't you understand ?
i keep it for emergencies .
all i need is time .
it is a pretty crucial subject .
why ?
that probably dropped half way to pomona ! ... what do you think ?
who told you this , majesty ?
my jury 's still out on that ,
you 're drunk , boy . i 'm not gon na bet ya any more .
you know what i mean . we 've done it before and we can damn well do it again !
why go through cecile ? why not just attack court ?
dr. malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology .
you better not either .
remember what we found ? fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it . remember ?
betty , honey , listen to me . a man came by from mutual life insurance . he says you 've got money comin ' to you from del 's policy . del 's life insurance policy -- are you with me ?
you do n't need to lose any weight . you 're kidding , right ? you look great . very fit .
uh . shit , i , uh ...
better than i remembered .
how about the doorway ?
mary clarence !
both dead .
no , it 's not . i thought i was done waiting for reed ... we 're all in this together now , ben .
no , george , just concentrate on the anger . anger .
i 'd kill it .
... i 've never tried it .
and ... may i kiss you , like in the movies , may this be an exception ?
alright . why so pissed ?
so happy and so tired .
he still might be around . i saw fresh tire tracks coming in .
frida ? you okay ? look , i think i know what happened to mark . i want to help . i 'm coming over .
why not . i trust you . you could n't turn me in because of doctor-patient privilege ... and i do n't want to be `` withholding '' ... and i know where you live .
why did you do that , brother ? i 've never done wrong to you .
i still want to look over a couple of things .
jackie , they come to be part of my life . rachel < u > is < /u > part of that life .
me too .
maybe you should call her .
the what ?
i do n't fucking know . what am i , his biographer ? olaf , what part of russia are you from ?
yeah , well , monkey or not i 'm still editor of this rag . amy , i thought you were doing that piece on the f.b.i . -- j. edgar hoover : when will he marry ?
somebody 's got to do it --
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
you think be 's pretty nice , do n't you ?
there ?
they fished t'gether . went to school . carl junior treated him like a white person . like any friend .
oh , jesus .
is n't there an escape pod on this ship ? something ?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted .
yeah -- i see i 'm right where i 've been for seven years --
jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew . he was marooned on an island , left there to die .
well , i do n't like to see you mope .
absolutely .
good morning , suzette .
where 's the five ?
i need this , roy . i ca n't run without money , and if i ca n't run i 'm dead .
liz , hold on a second -- what ?
she 's a young thing who works on my ranch . real name is sally jones or something wooden like that . she 's cute as a hot fudge taco , and , of course , it takes verve to change one 's name so charmingly . but she stinks like a slut just the same .
where 's the baby ? !
herb , it 's too much . it 's all out of hand .
mr. crawford asked my opinion . here we 've got a purported x-ray , dr. lechter 's surgery . do we keep it secret , or broadcast it ?
look . you know that and i know that , but somebody 's bucking for a promotion . i think it 's that bozo , hanrahan , i ca n't be sure . anyway , unless i go back there with something , you and your son-in-law are next week 's scapegoats .
do you want to make love ? you 're absolutely beautiful , those eyes , that expression . you 're absolutely the most sexy thing alive . do you want to make love ?
tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger .
now listen to what i 've got to say . i took up this profession when i was ten years old . in those days there were n't these modern machines . the films were silent . the projectors were run by hand , like this , with a crank . and you wound the crank all day long . it was really rough going ! if you got tired and slowed down ' boom ! everything would go up in flames !
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara . privately . i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible .
come in .
this is stupid .
we did at one point . when we thought we 'd have more children . and we after tried . we tried everything , but ... was n't meant to be .
i tell mine that they 're little men . i tell them they 're strong . they make me feel joy . i let 'em know . so they really know that i need them just as much . you know . just as much man . and you know , you 're their godfather ...
me too , doc . and i ca n't tell you what that package meant to me --
now where do we go ?
harold !
because i say so .
how come we did n't just drop near the camp ... save this hassle ?
my wife and i -- we 're thinking of starting a family .
it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .
the truck 's here . looks like they 've stayed inside since the snow started .
i am going after them .
but i was on duty ...
where 's the plow ?
does n't the dream master work for you anymore ?
what do you want ?
never have children . if they 're not a burden to you , they 're a burden to someone else .
right now .
oh no you do n't ! regulations specifically state : `` nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated . '' can you guarantee that ?
you want to tell me about it ?
yes . those are our own people . they never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning . it is much too hazardous .
because you 're going to help me plan a party .
were you watching me ?
jimmy looks twice put leo 's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago . and threatened him several times since . president clear moon and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat .
'give you a hand . i think my sleep for the night just ended .
mercutio 's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company !
forget it , venkman . you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me . now it 's my turn , smart-ass .
you own this place ?
you what ? .. what are you talking about ?
you 're giving away your money , fool ...
good idea . flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises . go too low , one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it .
ah , here we are . steed asked me to play a hunch : valentine peel .
jones is n't in his room . miss scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi --
why not ?
do n't call me a bum ! i ai n't no bum !
i did n't mean that , in life .
like a haunted house , right ? i do n't believe in ghosts .
what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down .
i 'm gon na go lie down and catch some z 's . today wiped me out . thanks , alice .
jabez -- help !
but , father , it is !
he must .
it 's the bitterest of pills .
no .
get my *whole* fall outfit -- and quit this job in style !
susie , i told you i did n't approve of that boyfriend . he was too old for you . you let him come into this house and be fresh to me . i went out one day and old mrs. jensen next door saw susan 's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus .
yeah .
i do n't know .
do n't , come on ! ! !
keep 'em coming .
hey , he 's a human being you can give him that much .
spare me the aria , i know what you want --
yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ?
what o'clock is it , mr noggs ?
she missed `` myriad '' on a vocab test two weeks ago , all right ?
fourty-four , twenty one dead .
all the elements are there . a woman , orphaned young , under a great deal of stress . the failure of a project she 's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven ' as it were . is it possible ?
no sign of 'em ...
oh my god ! ! you killed kenny ! !
-- she was n't a witch -- we embrace nature , not evil --
it 's funny .
like gang-busters . now , remember , if you do n't want to go to jail , we got ta put your boss in jail .
do you want to talk to him ?
do yourself a favor : do n't ask .
how can i help ?
will you do something for me ?
what ?
cut the bullshit ... okay , sanchez , you come with us . norris ... you stay here ... any of them move -- you fry 'em . and if you hear anything , anything at all you let loose the siren . we all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless . and everybody watch whoever you 're with . real close .
you , preacher ?
i do n't think it does . anyway , he 's indifferent to me .
good , sir .
just a place , i suppose ... who knows ?
cute thing .
no . do n't look ... the abyss will suck away your strength .
i want to get out from under all this for good . and i want to fuck them all doing it .
all right , folks , get on your mark . when you hear the pistol shot --
what the devil do you mean ? you have your lodgings , a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --
... i guess it 's ... just a matter of personal taste .
all right ! he did n't do it . all right ? now ... would you get the fuck off the phone ? i 'll bet that really changed them , huh ? anyway , leon ... did i do it for you ?
yeah , but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in 1938 at grover 's mills , new jersey ...
you 're telling me .
i want you to calm down .
spend a year in the peace corps . make a medical discovery --
yeah , take it easy . will you relax .
we teach the tech 's to identify them and disregard ...
how 've you been ? how 's teaching ? i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours , huh ?
solid as a rock . hey , smith ...
stop waving that thing around .
i 'm by myself today , ate my lunch outta the microwave .

where did you hear that ?
do n't wake up vada .
what do we do ?
god , dana 's going to kill you !
you did n't ... get it on with him ?
but she loves you ?
i know what you have to do , but let me do it .
mr. sheldrake , i 've got good news for you --
are you mad ? ? ? ?
i am with you , my love . like no other can ever be .
oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome .
i think you know --
for the love of god . not spanish again . who 's the girl ?
you do n't make anything . it 's for exercising .
listen .
you know damn well i was at that dinner , and you swore to me that i would have a fair hearing at that dinner ! did you not ? ! did you not ? ! well , tell me i was at least at the dinner ! a-allow me that much . give me that much at least !
am i supposed to say 'thank you ' ?
see how easy it is ? perhaps miss mayfield left her door unlocked . or if she did n't , there 's a passkey on every floor in the linen room . the head porter has a passkey . the bell captain has a passkey . the hotel 's full of passkeys .
just part of hospital routine .
the food , the sky , the certain , uh , sexual temptations -- you have n't become `` addicted '' have you , cole ? to that `` dying '' world '
yes -- and for me , it 's going to leave at any minute . let 's drink .

may i talk to you ?
who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead . when he begins to care about the living , you 'll find his heart can bleed ... and i want it to bleed for me .

now i know i 've got a heart -- 'cause it 's breaking .
yeah , ok. forget it . we wo n't tell anyone .

well , maybe i left the car up at martini 's . well , come on , gabriel .
you know , baby , i ca n't figure you out .
hello , memphis --
all night ?
just some local pinot , you know , then a little burgundy . that old cotes de beaune !
i 'm good - i was just making a delivery near here , so i thought i would see if you were about ...
that 's on the second floor . could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you ?
the whole core of mars is ice . the reactor melts it and releases oxygen .
he 'd let you off at the nearest port , that 's for sure .
i hear some surfer pulled a knife on mr. hand this morning .
but , david .
business .
you should have been a marriage counselor . but i 'll show you what 's wrong with your theory .
the state theater ?
well , then logging got to be too much like work , so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica . that 's a swell place , they even have a rollercoaster . i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece .
ho ! ho ! a dash of american humor ! vladimar skrapinov !
go ? ? ?
it 's a knocking-shop . tres discreet , huh ? he visits his ladies on tuesday and thursday nights and saturday mornings . his security 's in the car beyond .
it 's very ... satisfying . i 'm not sure i understand why .
here , drink this . drink lots of water . hold on to this . take deep breaths . nice and slow . would you like a lolly ?
illegal channels ? shit , if there 's any channel that should be illegal , it 's whatever that women 's channel is . lifetime supply of pantyhose , or some shit .
yes . i 'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore .
jen ? are you all right ?
what ? by myself ?
you sure ?
nice .
well , i 'd really like to know what you think . why do n't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it ? i 'll wait ...
no one could have predicted dr. grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle !
just in case they do n't give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch鈚eau in the touraine , and if you feel the need of a change ...
hurry !
how do i do it ? i 'm not that beautiful .
do n't kid yourself -- she means it .
you know what , wes ? if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war .
it 's your radiator hose . it 's busted .
... but , with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh , c'mon , c'mon ... they ca n't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as i 'm careful . ... mind you , if ever they could prove i 'd been working on their equipment ... well , that 's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch , sir .
it 's just for verification through the credit card company .
, if we do not provide v'ger with certain information , we wo n't have twenty-two < u > seconds < /u > ; the plan must be implemented upon arrival .
try and understand this . i 'm a decent republican . i believe in richard nixon . i worked in the white house four years -- so did my wife . what happened on june 17 i do n't think the president knew anything about . some of his men i 'm not so sure of .
no time .
about what ?
i suppose you want to know where i 'm going to kill tonight , peter ?
is he related to the witness ?
... and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle .
it 'll do fine .
why her ?
you do n't have any problem . you 've got thirty good years ahead of you , easy . maybe you 'll have to cut down as you grow older , get along with just two fiancees , but ...
why not ?
only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
maybe i will .
what 's these ?
huh ?
well , you know what they say , `` smile and the world smiles with you . '' heh , heh . the man should be in a straight jacket . feeling better ?
forget it , man . it 's not worth it .
il fallait le faire .
you better watch out for her . she 's after charlie .
oh you !
oh sure yes , that 's fine , late dinners are good . should i get dressed up or -- ?
that 's an order , commander .
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas . you ?
yeah , me too . that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers .
was n't that close ?
we 're gon na blow up the powder magazine .
excellent work , dr. nebbleman . you have outdone yourself .
and those who explode bombs in public places , do they perhaps respect the law ? when you asked that question to ben m'hidi , remember what he said ? no , gentlemen , believe me , it is a vicious circle . and we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions . because the problem does not lie here . the problem is : the nlf wants us to leave algeria and we want to remain . now , it seems to me that , despite varying shades of opinion , you all agree that we must remain . when the rebellion first began , there were not even shades of opinion . all the newspapers , even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed . and we were sent here for this very reason . and we are neither madmen nor sadists , gentlemen . those who call us fascists today , forget the contribution that many of us made to the resistance . those who call us nazis , do not know that among us there are survivors of dachau and buchenwald . we are soldiers and our only duty is to win . therefore , to be precise , i would now like to ask you a question : should france remain in algeria ? if you answer `` yes , '' then you must accept all the necessary consequences .
and ?
clair , george clair ! what the hell brings you to new canaan ?
it has to do with my father .
that 's the point , you stupid fuck . let them buy it . we let them buy the case . that 's what i took it for . you let this drop -- we 'll go up to new hampshire , kill some fuckin ' deer ...
well , if cronkite 's so great , why do n't we run him instead ?
you can open your eyes now .
no !
and her voice ? like lark song ?
ted , what 's wrong ?
when you were outside with bill .
she 's got nothing to do with this . let her go .
not likely , reggie . maybe i just need some help .
oh magnificent one . what i am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son of jor-el .
where ?
it means that if we can not have fired those torpedoes then someone else did .
this is an official visit , then --
yes ... i 'm very sorry ...
i do n't know what to do anymore .
got the ending figured out yet ? time 's running out .
the reason he is called bacon is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them . but he is a big boy now and it is time to move on .
andy , it 'll be fine ! it 's what we 're known for ! `` maui ? `` wowie ! ''
if memory serves , there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects . by the beginning of the fusion era , these reactors had been replaced , but at this time , we should be able to find some .
heh-heh --
wait , mama , wait . i have something to tell you . i 've decided ... well ... i 'm not going to make movies anymore . i thought that 's what i wanted , and i went after it with all my soul , the way you taught me , but i was miserable , mama , and it nearly killed me . so now ... now it 's over . i want a different kind of life , something ... simple . i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful ... in the country maybe , and i 'll have dogs and cats -- i feel so light suddenly , so clear for the first time in ... it 's going to be okay , mama , i know it . and i love you .
thought i 'd have a go at building the birdhouse on saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand ?
he 's a house-afire !
how much do you want for him ?
forget it . stick to the program .
i did n't want him meeting me here .
everyone else in that store is a statue , they see their lives passing in front of their eyes , but not you . you抮e making a business deal ...
could n't get on the boat . i 'd just < u > shoot < /u > the feller . < u > then < /u > tie up , throw him inta th ' drink . and skip bein ' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding .
it 's getting dark and cold . i 'm tired .
do n't look directly at him .
how many men have i talked to ?
can you protect me ?
it does n't take much to remember what day they come ... .
i ca n't spot 'em myself but you could . that red-haired one , you could spot a half-mile off , i bet .
well here is the problem at hand : the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits , and kill him . as our english rivals have left the catholic church , louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both . he has already picked the pope . only the jesuits , who put god above throne or papacy , stand in his way .
enough of this , our dinner waits .
i will not have it butchered .
uh ... over easy .
you say that just to flatter me .
`` never say die . ''
you sure this is such a bright idea ?
i thought i was --
burn ? ? are you kidding ? it 's freezing !
she 's been without therapy up here and i will not allow her to ruin ...
march man in tennessee , sniff the pines ... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin ' down by the river . what you got taylor ? let 's see three hundred and what ?
then i will consider it a declaration of war . one . two ... three .
who 's that ?
it 's up to us , hamish !
you 're not telling us something .
i hit it . i hit it with my cane . then i carry it on the cane and i throw it down to the incinerator , down to the garbage .
hey , hey , hey , i 'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that 's crossing the line !
actually , it all starts tomorrow . it 's one of those four-day weddings , with all the traditional events , and ten million people flying in from madagascar such .
shut up . i do n't feel like dying today .
i have n't seen you cry since you were a baby . this must be serious . where 'd you meet him ?
not the guards . some of the prisoners are easily disturbed .
you 're late , bro !
a little .
at paul and miranda 's . paul from work .
he 's dead and there 's nothing we can do . come on , frank , that 's it .
looka that ! two of them . oh my ...
no , that 's my other brother , freddie . my other brother freddie , he 's been married four years already . he lives down on webb avenue . the one who got married sunday , that was my little brother , nickie .
i think they 'd understand .
i suppose . though they was leavin ' in a hurry .
look . you got men , you got parasites that live in , on , and around men . now . why not breed a parasite that does something useful ? eh ? why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs ? why not , for example , a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney ? if it takes a little blood for itself , so what ? be generous ! you can afford it .
captain howdy , do you think my mom 's pretty ? captain howdy ? captain howdy that is n't very nice .
wait . that 's yesterday , from the other office . today is ...
what do you care ? ever hear of rwanda ?

richardson is a fine student . he 's got a glib tongue , but you 'll be a better doctor , fettes . come along now --
this is permission to take her apart .
yes , so i 've heard , a shame ... as you know , we in the soviet union have the keenest interest in developments of the first american financial corporation ... we are pleased to hear that you may fill benjamin 's place should he fail to recover . be seated , please , mr. gardiner .
who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . hurry up , he 's probably in purgatory by now . sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again .
i do n't follow baseball .
whoa !
in the past year i must 've said a hundred times `` we got ta get out of perfection . we got ta better ourselves . '' you gon na stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i 'm the reason we 're still here ? you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right < u > now < /u > ?
i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman .
in anticipation of making you sick .
i do n't get you , king .
yeah , i just picked the one that sounded the easiest .
i mean -- about my getting a divorce .
i was n't gone more than a minute . just went out to find you something to eat .
you know that girl i told you about . the one i love .
well -- where ya goin ' ?
new star . hey , guess what ? i got a new star on the readout .

that 's very flattering .
what do you want ?
open it .
do n't promise ... just deliver .
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words . the truth ! correct ?
people hate jews . do you agree ?
and do n't send your guys down there to stop me ! i mean it .
you do n't change , do you , bill ?
where does it all get us , grandpa ?

this afternoon .
everything you know is from me .
wolf-slayer , worm-sticker ... give a cheer for the champion !
yeah . but to be honest , i put myself in that position . when i drove up there i said to myself , `` if i can kill 'em and get away with it , i 'll do it . '' i could . so i did .
my palace in petrograd ... yes , you took that away from me . you took away my czar , my country , my people , everything i had ... but nothing more -- i warn you .

i 've never met anyone like you , betty .
cool ! huh huh huh .
what happens to them ?
i ca n't ... make it ... podner .
you 're a soldier , max . that 's what you were put here for . but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up .
like hell they would n't .
and then what happens ?
i do n't follow .
nobody special enough , curly .
restless .

i mean , it 's there , reggie . if only we could see it . we 're looking at it right now .
i mean . i want to ...
eventually . these things are always a matter of leverage .
izzat so ?
personally i think the guy went a little nutso . split town for a while . maybe he did go to london . sightseeing . drinking . whatever . anyway , i 'm pretty sure he 'll turn up sooner or later . i mean , to think that one of his friends killed him , for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous . is n't that right , patrick ?
couple thousand . most of them evil
what were you doin ' here anyway ?
love to .
how are you ?
servis made it through again ?
so you 're really michael meyers ' sister ?
peter , do n't let that stop you all of a sudden .

mother , i can explain everything . i 'll go with you in five minutes and --
sacks of grain , even bread . i own the grain licenses for the military , i can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the danube .
you turn into him , check him out , identify friend or foe .
no . i do n't know what you are , but you 're not scott .
one two , freddie 's coming for you ? no . rod killed tina . he 's a fruitcake and you know it .
that 's a strange angle .
well , the thought had occurred to me . i needed chimera in order to peddle bellerophon . for hero to be appreciated , you need a monster . now that 's not so difficult to understand , is it ? look , time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo ! not anymore ! ..have you any idea the r & d money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that 's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium ? if i could n't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there , you 'd help me put one out there i can make on ! ..there it is . i 've confessed . i , john c. mccloy , am in business to make money . lilly 's making billions feeding prozac to depressed dogs . pfizer does n't even know where to put the money they 're making on viagra , and let me tell you that shit did n't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose , jesus , who do i have to screw to get a a break ! ..now get me out of here , get me treated and let 's go back to work ! ..
ca n't help you .
and you ... ? do you love enzo ?
they do n't go for the vault ?
cooperation . if you try to escape , you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade 's bodies will prevent you from exiting . good day .
you wanted to see the propellers ?
what is it ?
i always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life . but it was n't . the real fear was hiding underneath : what i read in the journal , that my parents ' deaths were my fault . that 's what i could n't remember . that 's the crime i 've been paying for all these years .
how do you tell those two apart , anyway ?
so you just decided to return it to the sender . or , in this case , the sender 's wife .
i 'll see you reach the wizard , whether i get a heart of not . bee-hive -- bah ! let her try and make a bee-hive out of me ! you know -- hmm ? what 's that ?
we 'll start a fire -- -- and get rid of these microbes .
i 'm always considerate- my mother taught me that .
i 've fallen in love with somebody else , lila .
must be a story there .
-- you know better ...
no , that 's all .
my recommendation : do me . do n't take the chance that i 'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass . ghost me , riddick . would if i were you .
it 's the truth . those 17 superstars are our insurance policy . we ca n't open -- ca n't make a profit without them .
there they are . no herd though .
i know , and the magician 's goal is to find his true self . but what 's this got to do with it ?

no sweetheart , you ca n't .
then i 'm afraid we 'll have to impound your money until we 're sure that it 's all good . can i see your wallet and your ticket , please ?
maybe not even that , uther . i thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword . but it 'll take another , a greater king ...
oh , i do n't have one .
dr. woodly . i should make a little list .
why should i worry ? is there a problem ?
uh-oh ...

well , he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well ... i think he had alzheimer 's , he would be coherent one day , incoherent the next and one < u > coherent < /u > day , he asked me to end his suffering . i would n't < u > do < /u > it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that i finish him off . finally i just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead .
mathematics is the only truly universal language , senator . we think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention .
they 're burning all the canadian stuff cause of the war .
back ?
larry , we 're not electing the fucking pope here . just tell me who won .
what ?
sure you do . everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house . it 's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him . not for lack of trying .
gary , you 're quite an animal .
you see , i 've got the best house in all of addley . it 's not the biggest house , but it 's got the best location , right next to the junior high baseball field . the garage windows face left field . the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them . the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens . two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows . it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far . i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up , the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship . i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass , i know we 're one step closer to winning it all .
and this is your house . wow . the house of frankenstein . i thought you 'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa .
you mean i wo n't resist them .
goodbye .
that 's not what i witnessed david .
permanently disrupted ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this 'incident ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
well , it means another two weeks in paris .
but you have n't put in for emigration .
you got a pocket pager ? what are you , a doctor ?
i 'll do no such thing . i 'm going there myself . you 're going with me too , anderson - and you too , cobb .
by you -- keitel blacksmith ! do n't you know , erik , that is why he went with you ? ragnarok was good for his business ...
is there food ?
i think we both know who did . what 's so urgent ?
what the hell was that all about ?
no , you did n't , bob .
nun ? was ist ? haben sie 's herausgefunden ?
but it 's july .
it 's an anagram . it comes from the canons of dort . every letter stands for a different belief . t-u-l-i-p. like -- are you sure you 're interested in this ?
hey , baby , what 's happening ?
what the hell you doing back already ?
we do n't tell anyone that . which is why you can talk to us . and if we ca n't verify what you say someplace else , we do n't print it . that 's another reason you can relax .
what about jaeger ?
will you promise me that ?
really , frank ? when was that ?
really , why 's that ?
out of the question . a circus like that ?
i thought we were talking about sidney ?
i do n't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before .
i think i just got my period .
you know mom , like in the pool .
know what ?
yeah . i mean for months i 've been seeing you with ray you being his girlfriend and i kept wishing you were my girlfriend ... but , you know , what could i do ?
banishment ? be merciful , say death ; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death . do not say banishment .
are we imagining it ?
as i said , what seems to be the trouble ?
i beg your pardon ?
are they standing ?
why not ? do n't you love artie ?
last anyone saw , riding hard , northeast , his staff a hundred yards behind , trying to catch up .
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ?
what 's that ?
well , we are one miracle short tonight . so , just guard the stairs ?
is that the way you want it , boy ? a bullet in the head in the middle of the desert ? ends like this and you wo n't be able to spend a dime of that blood money .
i told you ...
hello .
you-betcha .
so ...
you can handle it .
i agree . we play along for now , we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks .
{ winking at sam ) she does n't like me telling anyone but she 's pleased as anything really .
you 're not the first , but he 's much too innocent , much too involved with his work , to realize what 's going on around him .
will we ever be in war ?
... it was a great city . the greatest city in the world .
helen got it for me in oslo .
you gave us names ? what are you , the `` face '' of the fantastic four now ?
perhaps he will listen to you ...
i feel like dirt . they even want to know what he 's doing in utah ?
what is it ?
what period ?
are you really ? i mean , we 've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this ... i mean , we 're destroying an innocent girl . you do realize that .
every day . the manufacturer recommends it .
look where ?
man , that one made me puke !
i 'm sure the police would make an exception in your case .
sure ...
yeah !
what about joe ?
she knew she was gon na die .
yeah . to get the hell off this farm .
unlike you , sam , i learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man . remember what freud said : 'sometimes a cigar is just a cigar . ' or , in this case , a drink is just a drink .
got tired of me ?
if challenged , our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission .
very well .
geometry ?
. actually . i 've been in twice .
you did it for namath .
which is why i hoped you 'd snub him .
well , come on , then . what are we waiting for ?
well , then i mislead you . or you made the wrong assumption . either way we 're asking her to resume a prior relationship , not do anything she has n't already done .
what 'd you do ? snoop all over the place ? you had no right . you had no right to go through anything .
henry 's got our orders ! we 're going home !
an austrian .
that 's what i was sent down for . i 'm your guardian angel .
i have .
very generous
i 'm not . you 're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
well ?
i 'm sure he could give you some courage .
... who ? ... did she say how far apart the pains were ? ... when was that ? ... oh dear .
good sir knight , will you come with me to camelot , and join our number at the round table ?
well , i 'll be -- ! ! !
you said something to him , did n't you ?

look , i 'm telling you again and you 'd better believe it , i 'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum !
on your pillow .
the dope ring . you must know what 's going on in this hotel . why do you think we 're here ?
how are you holding up ?

you must have been crazy .
all right , but ... i 'm going to check on you .
permanent damage .
thank you so much .
and what happened ?
look , now , charlie , give me a big laugh here .
we did . bad mistake . the fans are clamoring for more . so , evil never dies , right ? anyway , a while back we got a call from wes . he 's got this idea . and who better to resurrect freddy than his creator ?
come on , delly , look at the country today . we 're fighting communists in korea , we 're paranoid about the russians , we 've got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb ... you think they want `` suspected communists '' entertaining the american public with party propaganda like , gosh i do n't know , `` sand pirates of the sahara ? ''
what ?
no , i do n't think so ... i was having a nightmare . wait a second ...
oh , yes . i heard .
ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you .
work ! do n't say that word , man .
you tell dr. thurman whatever you want .
oh . that 's nice to know . we 're going to hang you , you know .
come here .
how about if i try humility .
fuck 'em ! fuck 'em all , man !
nice to meet you . if you do n't mind me asking you - how old are you ?
good .
how come ?
better go on back and get some more sleep . you 'll need it later on .
you 're the only human being i care for .
i 'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater .
i heard you met shu lien today .
and if i use them to kill you ?
you were n't supposed to relieve me .

dudes !
yeah , fine .
all those people ...

minneapolis .
that 's the door .
clyde wynant 's crazy ... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this . no wonder the police think he has something to do with it .
jesus ! what the hell happened to him .
who is this ? i 'm the one telling you the way it is , okay , asshole ? that 's who i am . now you want your three hundred grand or do n't you ?
mr. spock ?
ok not your imports . all your other cds and your k2 snowboard .
sometime yesterday morning .
oh .
red herring would have been too obvious , do n't you think ?
martin , i do n't know where you 've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago , and i do n't care . it was good that you left , and i 'm glad you did . so what do you want to talk about ? you 've grown up a bit . maybe i had you figured wrong .
he was n't my boyfriend . i had a boyfriend at the time ... what was his name ? anyway , glenn was like thirty . i was only fifteen . but he was a nice guy . real sweet . liked to talk . we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that .
she lies all the time . why would i say i fed her if i did n't ?
what did you do that for ? it makes him mean as a snake .
i need a favor .
well then , can you have them jump to the camera over here ?
what do you mean `` complete '' ?
we do .
good . i want around-the-clock surveillance on that house .
i do n't give a good goddamn about finland , norway , sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from .
you have a rather checkered past . mr. creasy . your interpol file is six pages long .
let me give you some useful information , son . there 's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you 've put in casing the joint so far , you wo n't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains . however you slice it , that 's a losing proposition .
edgar , wonderful to see you . clyde ... hi .
along the optic nerve to the eye .
i know .
you 've just done it -
just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless alvioli of the lung -- and we ca n't get enough to fill a microscopic tank .
i want my man back .
the old man ? he 's gon na tell you who killed leo ?
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police , herr galgenstein , a relationship which , no doubt , aided in the younger gentlemen 's promotion .
i wo n't be that long .
who the devil are you ? what do you want ?
right down here .
i left instructions with julia . she 'll get it from you . goodbye .
do n't do this . send her a card - something .
good bye .
i told you . i like you .
-- where 'd you go ?
what i 've heard so far , it 's all a lot of talk . i was n't so sure what to make of it at first , cause , like i said , the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix .
ooh look , time to confiscate my first water balloon ...
yeah , you know holden caulfield in the catcher in the rye would n't put up with their bogus nonsense .
you knew my jody ?
oh , yeah ? how good ?

i thought he was a kind , gentle man ?
just kidding .
why did you marry me , miles ? why did we have these two children ? you do n't need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it does n't love you like we do .
where are we ?
< u > look < /u > at him ! i think he 's dying !
c'mon lloyd .
thanks . i hope you can come for the launching .
well we ca n't call ourselves the mystery people .
your insight serves you well . bury your feelings deep down , luke . they do you credit . but they could be made to serve the emperor .
then , maybe i do see what you 're after -- perhaps ... you get to chose again ...
but fearful of her virtue , she comes to him dressed as a boy
all right , i 'll grant you a bird 'll panic in an enclosed room . but , they did n't just get in . they came in ! right down that chimney .
looks like 'rest home ' for this marriage .
you like it ?
well , why do n't you tell me what 's going on ? do you mind if i turn this on ?
i suppose you are going to tell me where it is going .
walter .

i do n't know .
well , where the fuck is he ?
honestly ... no .
hi , alyssa .
andy ? when a three-year-old says there 's a monster under the bed , you do n't say 'forget it ' . you look under the bad . i 'm three years old . call the prison .
it 's okay , professor tripp . carrie , howard , the others -- they 're right . my stories are annoying . they go on and on and on , and the longer they go on the more annoying they become , until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
no way ! you 're kiddin ' !
ah ha . you finally want to know about women .
maybe not . but you 're not telling me everything , are you ?

the dolphins are n't the only ones who do n't feel very good sometimes .

when i was a mere spit of a lad on ferry street in dublin the nuns used to say to me , `` nolan , do n't be swallowin ' ye words like fishballs . when you got something to say ? 桾alk with your mouth wide open , '' so if i 'm loud do n't blame me ? it 's the fault of the nuns !
like what ?
hey , hey , are n't you afraid you 'll burn out a tonsil ?

just for a minute , baby . i got something i wan na tell you .

webb 's reinforcements will arrive or not . if they do not arrive , the fort will fall . if that happens , stay close to your father . the french will protect the officer class among the english .
ah , mr bean ...
no , you 'd keep me for yourself . four years fuckin ' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it .
great ? he 's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him .
great , send him to the marines . this guy 's not a negotiator . he 'll quit in two weeks .
i wish you had n't done that .
yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except god into their hearts , he will vanquish all pain .
where did he go ? he has n't had a screen credit in four years --
sit down .
shut the fuck up , you fucking faggot , you just shut the fuck up .
the airport ? why ? are you leaving ?

let go of me or i 'll scream , i 'll call the police .
that 's the way these people are . you do n't hit both pumps you just piss them off .
how come you do n't hate their guts ?
but is n't it kind of hard to get into law school ?
that 's being obscurest ... who else ? better known . memphis ?
the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type .

i swear i 'll shoot you in your sleep .
is it coming from our own computer ?
laura , now i ca n't find that blue sweater . did you take it again ?

lotta law around here . just met the sheriff .
jim ... for godsake !
you want to go ballistic ?
then it 's done .
it should n't last . gives me time to take a go-go juice break .
you must agree to be blindfolded ... just for the journey . it might appear unseemly - you抮e the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement .
dartmouth
i would n't do that . it 's against the law .
... everybody . mike says , `pat , you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer , and then you go in the back and get laid ? ' `that 's correct . ' mike says , `pat . have you been in this bar ? ' pat says , `no , but my sister has ... ' everyone . buy yourself one too .
okay .
let 's get to the physical .

what is it about my writing that 's so rotten ?
what did you think ?
let go o ' me ! i 've got to get bruce out of jail ! oh , walter , why did you have to do this to me ?
... through the kitchen ...
it 's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself , not just because i 'm my brother 's sister .
it 's been a few years .
what 's happening ? what do you want ?
bree -- thanks -- i do n't want to .
i called you a taxi .
we 'll take it .
those arabs wo n't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes .

the kid will do fine on his own . give it your best shot , ricky !
charlie ? you say that like you 're close , personal friends .
how 'd you like to kill someone for me ?
how 'd they --
i know , but i had to because . . .
pop leibel .
i saw a man , somewhat < u > fatigued < /u > . quickly dressed , a bit dishevelled . in the middle of the day . an old story . and then i saw the clothing was < u > fresh < /u > -- therefore : a man who dressed at < u > home < /u > . and then i remarked the new < u > wedding < /u > ring . and so : the < u > story < /u > gave me pause . a lovely story . a new , and a beloved < u > wife < /u > . i wish you joy .
hey , do n't worry . chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .

the first match i got in mind for you is in louisville , kentucky .
belle --

someone has to do something .
george is going to open a shop .
jews can no longer own businesses , sir , that 's why this one 's for sale .
what ? yeah .
i got fifty bucks . i 'll get more .
there 's something i 've been meaning to tell you , heather .
seventy a year .
man , are you crazy ? you think that scares me ? i 'm from l.a. we invented gangs . we were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it . we get royalties from other gangs . now gim me your badge and gun and i 'll show you how it 's done .
what did you say ?
no ... of course not .
tell 'em your father gave it to you .
maybe they went out for the evening . let 's leave them a message and head home .
is this something you 're interested in ? i 'm not really that person i was .
it 's time somebody ate *them* .
we 're hooked !
i 'll ... take your word for it . so who are you , then ?
okay .
you 're the indian fbi .
i 've been there every day for the last four years .
oh if it 's going to make you uncomfortable ... perhaps we can find something else for you to wear .
i got an idea , snake . this looks like the prototype , right ?
dear god .
take me with you .
refresh my memory .
i do n't have all day , kid .

what do you know about the cop ? tazinari . the one who made the ransom drop with samuel ramos ?
you think terry gave me access to her things ? probably sold her clothes .
a -- flack jacket .

fletch , i got nervous . please ... .
how 'd you know it was me ?

we have n't fired -
and what if something happens to you ? am i suppose to go in after you alone ? !
you don抰 know why he抯 come to los angeles ? the man you say he killed ? who was he ? a colleague of his ?
i like that idea . that 's a real good idea .
it 's a trap ! they 're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england !
listen fellas , y'know he 's got 'til this week 's end . ya do n't have ta be hard asses , do ya ?
what ?
you 'll have to find that out , wo n't you .
not if the people change together in relation to that love .
where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records ? she could at least have the decency to call me back .
who does that new kid think he is with that coat ? bo diddley ?
oh , brad . let 's go back . i 'm cold and i 'm frightened .
but george , i like to push the boundaries ...
it was n't always fatal , wesley . we could scalp del right now , and he 'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels .
uh ... i think there 's some root beer ...
well , do n't start posing for it now . here , here -- ca n't work on an empty stomach . have some crullers .
conrad .

you 've just decided , is that right ?
you 're walker , right ?
oh .
he saw the wire .
so we got two full mini-tanks , three minutes each . 'cool ? how much air in yours ?
maybe he just travels in bad company .
what if your chute fails , bodhi ? rescind the order . let her off the hook , she 's served her purpose . do it , man , you owe me that much . let me hear it before you check out .
i will . so long , bobo .
i 'm really nervous that you 're gon na hate me soon . that you 're gon na find stuff out about me and you 're gon na hate me --
income tax evasion ?
she 's wondering what 's happening . we 're losing air faster than i thought .
everybody needs a hobby . okay , look page ...
your people do n't know about this part of out past . and they ca n't know -- it would threaten our entire existence here .
no .
listen , johnny , do n't do anything stupid . you could n't get within a mile of schaeffer right now . so stay put ... stay in touch ? i 'll let you know when maybe it makes sense .
i could n't make it in time .
do n't know if it 'll do any good , mr. cuthbert .
yeah .
because from what i 've heard , it 's a tradition and you 're a traditional guy .
well , a little .
you are n't coming with me .
i 'd better order some food . that sounds like an interesting case . would n't you like to take it ?
oh , i got over that . it was nothing , really . the papers always blow these things up . a little stiffness . that 'll go away . i just sleep more , that 's all .
you 've reported that you felt strong thought emotions . a group of minds from a space vessel ? could you make out any plan , anything to do with earth ?
no .
i hear she 's getting real fat .
that was wonderful .
i 'm curious . what was the nuttiest thing i did ?
i 'm not taking away your daughter , just your deal . you and i both know , after the divorce i kept you on for old time 's sake , so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey . i called what 's his name at warner 's . he said he 'd take a meeting -- in july . i 've fought for you viktor ... you want to talk severance ?
yeah , i know .
i see . hank brought them all . that 's all right . we 'll give them a drink and throw 'em out . how 's that ?
we got nothing , chief . we tore the place apart . we can only legally hold her for another couple of hours .
the board of parrish communications - is hereby called to order . our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecou 's generous offer and --
'cause you do n't respect yourself , which is your problem , but you do n't respect the game -- and that 's my problem . you got a gift .
so tell me ... am i still an angel ?
no , but you dress like an asshole ...
no substitutions .
believe me , you do n't understand . they would n't sit down at the same table .
i 'm an oreo , a sell out ? because i do n't aspire to do homeboys from out of space , secret diary of desmond pfeiffer , a pj 's or some as you might put it , some `` nigger '' show ? i 'm a tom ? i 'm whiter than white and you 're blacker than black ? is that what you think ?
i 'm not ?
oh really ?
the rest meant nothing to me .
i would n't mention the following , except he was very insistent . it 's obviously some sort of prank ...
exactly . we 'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard . it would cause the line to buckle . then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half .
i 'll getcha a piece .
well , sir , then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear .
the palace , hunh ? i bet those royals really live it up . of course they 're all a little , you know , from inbreeding --

you humans are very curious to us . you invite us to live among you , in an atmosphere of equality we 've never known before . you lay before us a beautiful green world , full of freedoms and opportunities ... you give us ownership of our lives for the first time ... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves : to live by the rules ... rules that are n't made to keep one people subordinate to another , but rules that exist to preserve equality . you aspire to very high ideals here .

innocent ? is that supposed to be funny ? look at the people i killed . an obese man , a disgusting man who could barely stand up ... who if you saw him on the street , you 'd point so your friends could mock him along with you . who if you saw him while you were eating , you would n't be able to finish your meal . after him i picked the lawyer . and , you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one . this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster ... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets .
i can not --
that ai n't up to me to hook you up . naw what i mean ? she her own , you know ?
oh come on , cecil .
when i was seeing carl tillman , i did n't know he robbed banks .
i 'm sorry ...
leaving what ?
speaking of money . you said billions . how many ?
what 's the fight about ? that 's her fiancee , is n't it ? are they blaming him ?
are you crazy ? what 's wrong with that ?
what 's he got in there ?
parry !
you did n't think i was gon na let you escape alone , did you ?
aw , no lovin ' tonight ?
this is hildy johnson ... oh , i can give it up all right . without a single quiver . i 'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats . oh , is that you , walter dear ? oh , i did n't mean `` dear . '' that was just habit , i guess . oh , be yourself , walter . i 've got some news for you ... yes , i got the interview , but i 've got some news that 's more important .
not that i know of . but arguments do happen , do n't they ?
oh yeah , i forgot about her . she was pretty hot .
i was concerned . as i said , women in that part of cairo , a european women , i felt obliged to .
i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a < u > note < /u > , a farewell note , a suicide note ...
i keep feeling like i 'm forgetting something .
want me to start right now ? maybe there 's some paper around .
no -- this is wasting time .
pass them potatoes , lincoln .
yeah .
tell me ...
but , how do i start for emerald city ?
harold , please ! i 'm on the phone .
good morning , mother . did n't i tell you that he 'd be marvelous . everybody thought he was so charming last night .
champion to champion .
ease back , mills .
dumbshit .
why ?
i ca n't give you anymore . i 'll talk to the doctor .
do n't know . she keeps screaming to stay out . he keeps screaming to stay out . we decided to stay out .
help me rhonda .
can we do that ?
i 'm sorry , did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws ?
dashboard .
you got it , verona . i pick up the tab , you do the honors .
yeah ...
not the jaguar . the _other_ car .
do you want a matrimonial , past wives , any kids --
negative . the t-1000 's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her .
we 'll leave this afternoon , right after the ceremony . pack only what you need .
and one bullet . that 's all it 's gon na take .
what about it ? you work hard . i 'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . and where 'd it get you ? ... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . and he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory ... wake up pal , if you 're not inside you 're outside . and i 'm not talking a $ 200,000 a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , i 'm talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , 50-100 million , a player bud -- or nothing . you had what it takes to let through my door . next question : you got what it takes to stay ... ? ?
those cars . what year is this ? ?
would you walk with me down to the paddock ? i 'd like to look at the horses for the eighth .
i do n't want the fuckin ' money ! i 'm not gon na give up everything i got for a lousy 50,000 dollars . it 's < u > you < /u > . you < u > grace < /u > or nothing . the whole thing ... i want you to be my wife ... . what do you way grace ?
i see . it 's like as if he 's going in a pattern . is that what you 're saying , bill ?
ready ?
god , fuck you !
oh yeah .
we want to meet him .
find out anything you can ... you got a grand coming .
how long does it last ?
waitaminit , dudes ! i got it ! we find four really small kids , beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets . what do you think ?
do you think i took some of that money ?
lie . that 's one . keep going .
please doyle , do n't .
why ?
well , maybe it 'll only be temporary , but i ha -- i have to try .
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons !
when they realise i抦 missing ...
how was that ?
now , just a minute . you have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why joseph should not give my wife the money which i left for her . i ca n't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation .
reason why he 's pullin ' ah pants down .
the money is n't here .
doesn抰 look like nothing .
you must come in first place to move on !
then why are you talking about this ?
no tears please . it 's a waste of good suffering .
that 's right , wendy , it is against floor policy , but as long as you 're here , let me tell you what i know about our cute little door friend . many years ago , this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named mr. white .
no . two times .
i want you to stay , okay ? i goddam invited you , did n't i ?
you 've had dealings with the police before ?
but if we < u > have n't < /u > caught it in a week , then we have to go into the freezers anyway .
no , sir , he is not .
i know that . maybe you know other doctors ?
jamie ? but i thought she was --
wait a minute ! come back and have a beer !
look , you 're not gon na take shelly 's camper .
i want to marry you . i want to take care of you and i want your children , and i want you to be my girl . that 's all i want . that 's all i want out of my life , and it 's a lot .
what 's botherin ' you , anyway ?
oh , ted , please be careful . i worry about you so much .
i 'll get undressed now . is that all right ?
i bet she would if my name was gregory ! !
well , let 's do it .
bullshit .
sshh ! ! ! sshh ! ! !
frightening thought .
go ahead ! c'mon ... repeat everything from the beginning , and then we 'll let you go . name ...
you 're back .
i am the clitoris .
you got into harvard law ?
oh . well , what 's this ?
jake , it 's chinatown . they 're all over the place . you oughta know better .
shut up ! the other officers will be here any minute ! you 're perfectly safe now !
okay -- let 's try and settle down here .
no way . get out . i 'm gon na tell frank . i 'm gon na tell him what you said .
this is fucked . you do n't know < u > who 's < /u > in that --
i 've got a surprise for you , chet . something interesting that i would like to show you . arrangements are being made and i will meet you at the portland , airport .
mary 's a little chubby , huh ?
i 'm so sorry , you guys . if it 's any consolation , i have heartburn that 's like , radiating down to my kneecaps and i have n't gone number two since wednesday . morning !
it 's gon na cost ya money . it always does .
who 's frank ?
for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped , or the wolf asking the sheep , `` do you hate me ! '' the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate .
how much money has he got ?
they 're merely tools to disseminate information .
an accident at the mill ?
paris ?
she 's importing stuff from all over the mid-east .
he knows , frances .
they wo n't talk to you .
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers .
you look way pretty , kim .
it 's not the first . there 's been several . and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat ... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit .
but i 'm the only one she trusts .
i dunno . it was ... an impulse . me , wearing my good shoes .
fuck him . what ? hello ?
stop asking me that . i 'm fine . who called you ?
we 're going to war , are n't we . if they 're doing all that it must mean we 're going to war .
we 're going ! we started la resistance to save terrance and phillip ! we 're going !
close your eyes , feel your fingertips . tell me everything you feel .
uh-huh .
i could n't say .
change me , rowan , and we can change everything ...
was he all pissed off ?
why ca n't you come ...
an exhaust system or a window is code .
your hair looks the same .
for what ?
i don ' need a hospital ... i feel fine .
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .
it hit me like a ton of bricks .
yeah ...
i 'm frightened and confused and i ... i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and ... and concrete and ...
claude banks .
give it to me .
well , it does smudge after all -- is n't that fascinating ?
bullshit .
you 'd be taking away his freedom , nathan .
seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today . you 're not planning on staying are you ?
i sure hope you have n't done anything dumb jackie .
how do you do ?
that 's a very stupid question , ross .
i did it myself . i read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces .
two men left town right after it happened .
blanca , por favor .
let 's start with some rhythm . sway back and forth like this .
make love to me .
it so happens i work here , and there 's an unsolved murder . i do n't like unsolved murders , especially ones my daughter 's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour ? you 're supposed to be getting some sleep .
just stop talkin ' to people , thelma ! stop bein ' so open ! we 're fugitives now . let 's behave that way !
i have school .
right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig . i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man . i will spray her apartment . after a few minutes you will knock on her door , drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window .
stand by .
of course not . it 's so easy you almost feel sorry for them .
how 's your war , mac ?
you whore !
no , no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself .
you know , babe brother 's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them .
so what do you want me to do ?
well she must 've packed on a few pounds over the years .
it 's a .45 .
will you be in atlanta for a while ? i 'm not buggin ' you about coming home , i just wondered .
some tap dancing , some singing .
you promise ? do you swear on st. christopher ... ?
for christ 's sake , violet ! i heard you ! thin walls , remember ?
charles .
fuck you , ricky . i ai n't going out today . i 'm going home . i 'm going home because nothing 's accomplished here ... anyone talks to this guy is ...
yes -- he always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes .
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break .
what kind of trouble -- ?
how 'bout a drink at the bar ?
then we 'll be right where we are now .
lasher is my legacy - not michael 's . aaron , i 've seen the pain in michael . i ca n't bear to see anymore . he 's not to know . swear to me .
you dumb fuckwad cop , you fucked up < u > bad < /u > !
you knew this man did n't die at the bomb site before we got here .
it 's not that i did n't mean everything i wrote . it 's just that -- i thought you were dead . and now --
my father left me the business .
that 's what i want -- a gaff rig .
i 'm the anti-christ . you get me in a vendetta kind of mood , you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you . my name is vincenzo coccotti . i work as a counsel for mr. blue lou boyle , the man your son stole from . i hear you were once a cop so i assume you 've heard od us before . am i correct ?
do you know how you will use him ?
oh my g-d .
see how you 've upset him . he was so merry and hale before you came home .
we blow up space shuttles for breakfast . you and your friend alex would be a late afternoon triscuit .
good argument for gun-control . what are you going after , rhino ?
we should not go much further in this murk .
is it hot in here ?
we could call a special meeting of the general assembly ... but of course the un does n't represent all of the nations .
where are you going , baxter ?
either you 're a member of the club or you are n't , elton . tell me what you know ...
i would 've in another life .
hello martin . how have you been ?
oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk !
i know of him .
not so fast . i would like to go over the details .
o'reilly !
mr. levene , i think we have to talk .
oh yes . that 's fine .
do n't matter . i let the monster out , you gon na do what it wants .

all right - you did n't .
i could .
you really ought to look at this , linda . there 's a drawing on every page ... and all these quizzes . it 's like school .
no . the portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people . i , too , will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of god .
when you 're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth ?
it stands so still .
you and i , niki , have very different ideas about sex .
it 's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter , and -
was n't nothing .
yeah .
oh , i see . out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul , is that it , joe ? the silver knight is getting to big for us . my methods have been all right for the past twenty years , joe , since i picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a senator , and now you ca n't stand it . well , maybe you wo n't have to stand it , joe . maybe we can fix it so you and your boy ranger can go home together .
my name is lorl , sir . i 'm a maidservant . i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
wow , kev ... it 's perfect .

mrs. rand was at the houmfort that night . but there 's nothing wrong with that . she 's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people , to help them .
i 'm in my p.j . 's , too . funny , huh ?

four minutes .
you know your divisions . you like the fights ? like the rough stuff ? yeah , i bet you do . like to get down and tussle a little bit ? like me and tuffy , before she got run over , we use to get down on the floor and tussle . i say to her , `` you a good dog , tuffy , here 's a treat for you . '' and i give tuffy what every dog love best . you know what that is ? a bone . i can give you a bone , too , girl .

i ca n't breathe ! ... i 've got to get out !
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho .
whoever tossed this place wants you . and i 'm looking to stay outta the line of fire .
the old guy ? what kind of show of faith is that ? i want debbie .
... but after ... awhile ... you begin to ... ... get used to it .
it 's okay , he just wanted his machete .
well , i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with grace .
just kickin ' back , i guess . i do n't know . jack and i were supposed to go golfing .
do n't make conversation with me .
you 've all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet . excuse me .
bernie . call me bernie .
i wish they 'd stop that . it makes me fidgety . do you think they 'll find him , nick ? he must be in new york ... . where do you think you 're going ?
you get fifty a day , period . it 's a business trip , they 'll pay for your expenses .
you 're a good sport , lady .
we saw .
i 'm not interested in your literary recommendations .
would n't you feel more natural taking a bow ?
tomorrow , 6 am . here . if you 're a minute late i 'm gone . and stud ... i did n't take you to raise . i can show you a few things but after that you 're on your own . that 'll be four fifty .
fairy tales ?
and he 's a perfect stranger to me .
perhaps not . but i did come here and i found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me . once started , it seemed such an easy way to do good . i should have known there was no easy way to do good , betsy .
but the real story is how i got the car . you see ...
what about id 's ?
it 's not quite the same thing .
and turn that fucking music off !
what ? oh , i 'm ... busy .
this is almost like the one at my uncle 's cabin in maine .
let me go in back . you look like you need all the room you can manage .
what ?
when he was around your age ... almost exactly your age . he said he figured out a trick to remember the past .
no . you do n't understand . your brother -- frank -- he 's here in the house . and he 's --
god- ...
yes , i can see your problem , mr kinnear .
just a guess . maybe they 're not where they 're supposed to be . maybe somebody moved them . habeas corpus -- no bodies , no crime , and nunez still plays as self defense . face it detectives ... you have nothing .
here 's the short course : fifty-four , forty or fight . what does < u > that < /u > mean ?
give it up .
absolutely positively .
to show me he does n't have to talk to me if he does n't want to .
you snore at night . that bugs me . can i take you out ?
what 's it to you ?
we will . there 's something i 've got to find out .
go ahead ...
top secret means you help me pick the other pilots , train , and go -- without knowing where you 're going until it 's too late .
you get to know each other pretty well out there .
no , sir . i 'm not going to deny it . but if you 'd just let me explain --
you and everybody else . god i hate this area . makes me nervous .
not here .
important ? of course it 's important . the point is we can do something about it .
yeah , maybe if he 's nice , he 'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn .
she 's not my type .
my god , mr. fairlane , you look like the fall of saigon .
nick ! ... i thought you went home .
what do they have in there that 's so valuable ? a cure for aids , a cure for cancer ?
you have the power . < u > will it < /u > .
does anyone ?
oh , well ... i guess you ... in high school , you were a pretty good first baseman . and we were on the debate team together . but ... i think you were gon na run the bijou . you were brought up there , and you loved it so much . and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that .
uh , do you think these two sluts still live in highland ? that would be cool .
you 're so famous now .
you were hugh sloan 's bookkeeper when he worked for maurice stans at finance , and we were sort of wondering , did you go work for stans immediately after sloan quit or was there a time lapse ?
you 're drunk .
really ?
the chinese have one goal . the complete dissolution of our nation . the destruction of our culture . there is no room for buddha in their world . our only hope is to fight .
and you never heard of rock 'n roll ?
how do you know ?

ladder 20 was on the rock for training . we stopped there ... so she could get cleaned up .

hey , you 're always saying , 'bring me real life . bring me street life . and , like , one man 's mundane and desperate existence is another man 's technicolor . '
what do you mean -- haywire ? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers . you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games . you 're grand ! i 'm for you ! stupendous !
unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey !
you want me to do what ?
why not ?
i 'll explain you , leon : they 'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you ca n't write and they 'll ask you your job , your employer 's name and you ca n't tell them : my job , i 'm a hitman and my employer is tony , his record is longer than his resturant 's menu . that 's why you ca n't have a bank account !
peter kenneth appleton . hollywood , california .

no ! you 're one of them . of course , it makes perfect sense !
he is dead . you would be also , if your wound had not somehow shut .
... envy , sloth , pride and lust . seven .

that 's a `` rookies '' doll . george sanford brown . we got ta lotta dolls . they 're real cool . did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in `` the black hole '' ? i always found it funny somewhere there 's a kid playin ' with a little figure of earnest borgnine .
i knew there was a reason i hated this place . i 'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they 've done to you . how do you know the things they told you are true ? did they show you any proof ? all this talk about the lamas being hundreds of years old . how do you know ? did you see their birth certificates ? i ca n't believe it , bob . a bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world . and you , bob conway - two-feet-on- the-ground conway - want to join them . it 's horrible .
you said ... one shot .

i want you to forget what i said .
this is like my every wet dream come true . i do n't even care that you 're here , too , bro .

your royal highness . what a pleasure to see you here .

what do you see ? i see a butterfly .
and who does friedman work for ?
i do n't know who . whom . i ca n't trace it . in the old days it was simple . we kept books , we had ledgers , we could see what was going in and what was paid out . if somebody wanted to rob you , he 'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up . '' now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work !
weapons storage ...
you got it !
have a shot ?
this is ridiculous , lovejoy . find her .

so , five hours . plenty of time for a call . he was 'excited ' , you say . in the sense of being 'overjoyed ' .
you think he 's too old for me ?
shut up .
that 's kim ... and this one 's thelma and that 's mrs. willewska and this is daddy and that 's batman and over there is robin .
30 ? how long was i out ?

you do n't even know me .
look , we clear out , we get to the shack , we get safe . we hang there awhile . i 'll come back . i 'll check it out . but right now we ca n't --

you got ta mind your manners , you actin ' like a hillbilly tramp .
yes , i 'll accept the charges .
we do n't have much choice ... without air , the internal pressure will fall and --

it bugs me .
go ahead and laugh , you know what i mean . what a while bitch will put up with , a black bitch wo n't put up with for a minute . they got a line , and if you cross it , they fuck you up .

what happened down there ?
good morning , colonel .
i mean drugs . i thought you said he was ?
oh , my god , you mean it was good ?
you sure this goes somewhere ?
and who are you ?
danny , it 's not what you think .

have you gotten cuter since i last saw you ?
yup . you still got the spencer rifle ?
a small victory is n't that small when you 've been use to losing .
yeah , would of been nice to of knowed him , the way you talk about him .

keep the light up . i ca n't see .
eh , sure . we 're trying to expand our audience base -- and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman .
of course not . that would be irresponsible and unprofessional .
go away -- hide yourself .
try again .
i 'm thinking when i 'm home .
to negotiate what ? to negotiate what ?
a book on some of the most infamous murderers in america . i want to go to where they lived and where they killed and i want you to photograph it .
they 're just words .

how do you know that ?
i 'd like to make something clear . i do n't go after a girl ; a girl comes to me . her choice . right ?
no , the boy 's right . i really am evil .
tst-tst ! then i reckon i 'll have to try again ! where 's the money hid ?
is that what i think it is ?
you 're kidding .
lips still for sale ?
bobby -- i think it would be better if we did n't see quite so much of mr. carpenter
you must be exhausted .

los angeles .
he could n't , or refused to pay . we extended credit ...
i want to see my mother immediately .

no .
yes .
i 'd love to get you in an operating room . just once .
you think that < u > is < /u > the truth .
chicken shit . where were we ?
this one guy on death row , who i 'll call henry , told me about his last victim . henry says how he 's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named adele . her mother 's in the living room watching tv . she 's got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman 's jokes . henry puts his hand over adele 's mouth and says , `` if you scream , little girl , i 'll kill your mother . '' and of course little adele does n't scream , does n't cry , does n't make a sound . then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door . ten days later they find adele 's body . or what 's left of it . you believe in fairy tales ?
he 's a big boy .
i do n't suppose i could watch .
does it get any better or what !

i do n't understand about the whys and wherefores , father . i only know i want to be good .
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room , sir . they 're getting a trifle impatient , sir .

i do n't believe it -- he was a real gentleman . i know people ... i 'm so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes . no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work . but it 's too bad about the baron , you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow .

there you go again ! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument ?
there 's a better place ...
no really ... i do n't think that you realize what it means . the things that you do , sonny . you put a gun to somebody 's head ...
a strange threat . i can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . pity about mr. redfoot .
go back to sleep , baby .
that 's right trevor . the timing was impeccable was n't it ? it 's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body . just need you to id it for us .
he 's right , we ca n't rescind defcon 2. the soviets will think we 've gotten sweet on them .
i have to get up . still more to do . that boy hates asian people . that girl thinks she gave her mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand . her daddy touches her . his daddy never touches him . it would have been cooler if i 'd died .
we 're getting close .
had ?
heil you know who !
... skip the levity , kinney - what have you got ?
what i like about ian , he believes in a chain of command , but not a chain of respect , you understand what i 'm saying ?
just because they are born ?
... it could have gotten to somebody ...
i did n't do anything --
roger , wolf one .
er , that 's ... that 's enough music for a while , lads . it looks as though like there 's dirty work afoot .
short enough . but this is a grand start and i think we need to change the name .
not bad - not good - but not bad . you ought to be able to fool about almost anybody .
you do n't know anything about this woman . calm down . let 's just eat , okay ? the duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the highliner pinot .
like your business managers ?
first off , letty , can you tell me where you are ?
we think the same way .
listen , nick ! get it through your head or you and me are both dead too !
i 'm not open . we were just talking .
you 're too demanding .
yeah .
harmless !
i guess so .
do you know ... i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here .
right . wednesday .
... yeah ...
we 're hanging on by our fingernails and you 're giving me bullshit stories ...
his feet shall never cross my lips .
but that does n't prove that he 's the one !
but between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours , what happens , charlie ?
you never took a fucking vacation in your life , harry . what 's going on ?
i 'm staying here .
someone worthy of respect , lad . she be a water spirit , lives in a bog down at sea-side . hideous creature to look at , even by my doubtful standards ; devours little children , she does , when she can catch them .
in there .
do n't worry . i can protect my virtue . i mean , c'mon , wade , give me a break .
how do you do that ?
not if it ca n't dig .
you 're here 'til what time ?
they wo n't recognize me .
when was that ?
while you 're cleaning up , i 'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
the extreme always makes an impression , but you 're right , it was severe . did you say a cherry or coke slurpee ?
oh man ! i could 've gone all night without looking at that .
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you ? !
it 's been nearly a year since our first time and you 're still married to my sister , which ... i now realize is fine because you 're probably much more in love with her than you know .
not a one .
but i 'm here to help you ...
any man that can write may answer a letter .
oh , maxwell ? he 's left .
easy , dude .
we 're not stranded . we 've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back .
everyone back .
now many ?
i 'm not playing with you , these girls are looking to get you caught . they see you , they see dollar signs .
okay , okay . the important thing to remember , is to think slow . take your time . it may not seem like it , but the night is long . long enough . just think slow and think smart ...
well , i do n't know what you gon na do about it , because i do n't hear no riot an ' i do n't see no riot , an ' what 's more i do n't believe they *is* no riot . look for yourself .
that is n't granite . if that fell on me , it would n't hurt at all .
but corrado ... if something is beautiful why should n't one say so ?
that 's where we come from first ?
-- okay -- -- i 'll see you later . your house .
maybe he 's building a bomb ... just like- !
and we 're good at it .
i told you i 'm looking for someone .
... do n't you like me ?
oh no ...
young love .
well , he 's welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny ...
where you been hiding , grease-fist ? we 've been looking for you .
but expressively broken . how did it happen ?
it 's not that simple . it costs money to do this at home .
no , judy , i 'm not going to move ! please ! stay in the chair !
no i fucking do n't ! you ca n't make a cup of tea , edward .
thirty-bucks ? that 's it ?
next wednesday i grab a grand from snyder . an ' thursday two yards from cappoli , okay ?
he 'd just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .
no , admiral ... but is the human thing to do .
it would 've happened years ago if you had n't carried him . why the loyalty , wendell ?
okay . okay . de-nail ai n't just a river in egypt . she 's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion .
... free !
where 's kansas ?
faith ... ?
parents still together ?
what month ?
shit .
he told you .
roger .
this is a bad time , henry . i 'm busy just now . what do you want ?
hold on a minute . where you going ?
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me .
yes . there are certain punitive measures ...
do you pack a gat ? [ 11 ] a close view of the two shows the smile dying on shapeley 's face . he looks up quickly .
you go after the princess . i am an old man and would be of little help . i must try to find the crystal .
you always do that ! anyways , this is really hard , because , you know , my dad is really evil .
what is it laura ? what 's wrong ?
no . i feel more like - yodeling .
how ?
jane , jane , jane , jane , jane ...
and you , colonel ? let me guess : you do n't know .
you must learn patience , commander . do you know where i learned it ? in the dilithium mines of remus . spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a romulan guard抯 whip and you 'll soon understand patience .
but i have to pay the actors and the authors .
that 's no batlight , it 's a birdcall .
we planted it .
ash ?
i do n't know , i 'll get her a card or something .
well ... two million readers ... i know exactly what they want . chapter one : `` a childhood behind golden bars . lovely little princess plays with rasputin 's beard . ''
did he say `` making fuck ? ''
want some ?
excuse me , sir . i have an actual fact for you .
what do you mean ?
it 's just pearl harbor . people are a little crazy , right n ...
hello ...
f-14 's sir .
you 're not from around here , are you ? where you from ?
take us to vegas .
i would n't say that . but at least you 've put the camera to good use .
or an on-line computer .
roger .
that was a pity ...
do n't cane me , sir , i was led astray .
where have i been ?
well , george , who were you ?
maybe if you 'd come to the backers party , i would 've gotten the money .
i do n't `` want '' it , if you catch my drift .
squid ?
probably not .
not that i do n't have any respect for the law , but what 's your problem , man ?
i do n't know , boss .
what is it ?
what are you trying to do ? make bert look like a fool ? he 's made all the arrangements .
maybe i can buy him off . i got ta talk to mel .
to be frozen . to never change . a life of perpetual ice-olation . there is little perfection in that .
you make it all sound so simple .
do n't worry about it , all right ?
i need the job .
of course .
fighting抯 a part of it , annie . you know that , right ?
how about you ?
i need your help .
what is it ?
hey ! that 's a < u > prototype < /u > !
are you sure ?
not you . you抮e not disgusting . you抮e lovely . just the idea that they抎 bring an escort . i mean , a stranger who , um , didn抰 ... who never ... . i mean , someone抯 dead .
oooohh ! a fruit cake . thank you , mrs. sutphin . have a seat .
you said never to touch you before a fight .
i 'd slap his face .
so , in light of how the parents feel , and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute , i do n't think i can put you back in the classroom just yet .
i do n't suppose you 've ever seen this girl before either ? her name 's kristen , but i suppose you 've never seen her ?
oh .
donny --
he 's not even there . you do n't see him , you do n't hear him , you 're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys .
wait a minute , charlie . this should belong to the club .
i 'm sorry i did n't take another sock at him .
do you miss him ?
well then , let 's agree to disagree ... now how about a picture for my scrapbook ?
yeah , it 's fun for them , but it 's heaven for me . those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world . ooh , hey , i got ta run .
you see a black leather jacket , fingertip length , like the one pacino wore in serpico ? you do n't , you owe me three seventy-nine .
this is my friend josephine - she 's going to be a bridesmaid .
i want to watch you work .
we were just chortling over that . blas ? and epicene . it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary . so -- i hope you do n't mind , edward , i pinched it for my piece today .
i merely write the stuff . you 're the one that serves it up .
what did you tell them ?
just browsing . do n't touch me ... .
how so ?

oh , hell . drink ?
do n't guess . just come for my day 's pay owing and to tell you i 'm heading east .
all poetry was acceptable . the name simply referred to the fact , that to join the organization , you had to be dead .
that was a good fuckin ' movie .
roughly , one-zero-five . i 'll have it plotted in a minute , major kong .
naw . never did know too much of nobody . not to he'p me out anyway .
would you like to see it ?
elroy , what happen ?
bigger than that . for want of a nail a < u > kingdom < /u > was lost ...
no father , they 're edgy . on alert . like they act when they smell a predator around ... peeing on themselves and everything .
jesus . how much do you know about dyson ?
does he have your number , mr. jefferies ?
shut up .
that 's not true . besides , i do n't want you dusting . i want you to see new york .
do i know you ?
and i asked someone . charlie you think you 're pretty smart .
i 'd still go through -- even if i ended up in jail .
`` national priority . ''
not really .
what the hell are you doing ? ! !
i loved it ... he ...
hey , play that demo again , man . alright .
go back to the car and keep brian there . i do n't want him in here ... do it adele ... now !
yeah , he was probably drunker than my uncle , who fuckin ' knows ? so the cop goes `` stay here '' and he goes runnin ' down the highway to deal with the other crash . so , my uncle marty 's standin ' on the side of the road for a little while , and he 's so fuckin ' lit , that he forgets what he 's waitin ' for . so he goes , `` fuck it . '' he gets in his car and drives home .
church hill , that 's pretty close , is n't it ?
laz . i 'm gon na put my trust in you . i 'm gon na do it knowin ' all too well i can get hurt like this . and i have been hurt . just like you . woman like me , i got a lot of livin ' to do . but my days are precious to me . they all i got left . do n't want no more fuss . i want love in my life . you understanding me , laz ?
so hawkasaurus , i wo n't mince words ...
then what is it ?
it 's a damn company executive game , and she 's a damn company exec .
what now ?
go ahead , jay .
all right , this one time i 'll let you ask about my affairs , one last time .
i ran into complications .
what ? you talked to him ! did you tell him we dated before you were a priest ?
what the -- !
sharp -- real nice .
no . rajeev 's in india .
hey , what do you know . looks like we can have that drink after all . what 's your pleasure ? we got the downtown ramada . we got the travelodge on route 41. and ... the mallory .
it just goes to prove the theory of our state . if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you 're true to the collective spirit and stick together you 've got an omelet . that reminds me ... have you heard the latest they 're telling about the kremlin ?
the high lama ! who in blazes is he ? !
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot . shelly , i know where everything in this house is . sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is .
i < u > ca n't < /u > call an exterminator . i ca n't afford one . god , i ca n't even afford my < u > phone < /u > . i got fired .
it 's different 'cause you keep your own apartment . because you know it 's there , we do n't have to go to it , we do n't have to deal with it , but it 's like a-a-a free-floating life raft ... that we know that we 're not married .
i 'm looking ...
i guess so ... i know i felt something i never felt before ... and i did n't like it ... not a bit . i 'll tell you one thing ... sanctuary better be worth it . that 's the last place for me to live now .
what is it ?
do n't worry about it . you 're my guest .
he did . we buried him . there 's a place out in the woods ... if you bury something there , it comes back alive .
misty , if you want to lose weight go ahead , but do it for yourself , not for some boy you barely know .
thank you , mothershead . have a porter put them in my office .
but not now .
oh hi . forget something ?
i walked into it knowing i 'd get hurt , but i thought i could stand anything . i just was n't ready for that kind of pain . we were supposed to meet in l.a. when i got back there , he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife .
i give you my word . put the prototype into my hands , and you 're a free man .
as much as anybody .
how 's your mining operation going ?
how am i gon na sell things if nobody comes by ? this stretch of road runs between nowheres and nothin ' much .
i 'm fine , fine .
i ca n't breathe .
but why not ?
... the russia of piroshki ... people will eat and love it .
we 're practicing .
that 's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view . and that 's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar .
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips .
fuck you , grease-ball !
i 'll set john on you !
oh , he 's gon na be aces .
no . i really do n't .
fouls .
ext . dam - day .
so , like your father , you changed the rules ...
a lot ?
givin ' up that switch like a tramp ! behind my back and kill my baby ... !
most interesting .
order chinese for us and meet me the library ? anything but beef .
i don抰 think i抎 fight you on that one ...
blondes .
that 's right .
be good and be smart , little boy .
how do you know ?
okay .
little high .
oh no ! what man , jean-louis -- where ?
yes , bob , i do . excuse me ? am i being fired ?
we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours . what was the dream about ?
c'mon , norman !
good . you needn抰 worry about the austrian anymore . he抯 dead . i抣l be in touch .
i know you , detective carter , right ? you 're lee 's american friend . enjoying your visit ?
charlie and i were talking . that 's one reason i wanted to see you .
boy , he is great ! jeez , that old fat man . look at the way he moves . like a dancer .
bastard ! if you were a true american .
by car right ?
point of view is everything . to us , < u > your < /u > form of life is ugly as we appear to you .
dorothy parker --
yeah .
bet you did .
i lost him .
oh , go along with you ! as if it mattered to a grandma ! but p'raps you got an even chance .
crude and defiant as always , triple x. it fits so well because you 're obscene .
beasley 's dead .
uh-huh .
well , it 's a big canyon . honey , i 'm sorry but i 've got ta get back ... just for a minute .
cutting it out .
it 's today ?
why not ? just once . a trial run . what harm could it do ?
let 's forget it -- ca n't you see i kind of like you , too ... and i do n't want to get involved .
no volunteers , price . i said we 're all in on it .
jesus , would you stop ? you make my head hurt when you talk about this .
sure .
it is , is n't it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life .
you know dickson as well as we do . he 'll shut the doors before he gives up control .
i forgot to bring the champagne , mr. johnny .
say `` merrick '' .
we do n't have time . i 'll explain later , hurry !
i , uh ... thanks .
what ? ? ?
yes .
after our fencing match , i was rather hoping you would do the risking . more tea ?
oh , freddie . what could that wretched vampire say to upset you ?
says he is the man 's doctor ... you know ...
it 's obvious you want to talk to someone -- well , i 'm someone .
i inherited that money when i was thirteen , when my father died .
jabez !
many others .
that would definitely explain it .
well , actually
i 'm getting rid of the fucking animals .
what kind of words ?
how did you know we were on this island ? do others know ? will others come ?
who is this man ? you 're engaged !
you want a pint , go to the pub .
i do n't know . you seem ... different . you make weird jokes . your accents changed . you do n't even walk the same .
we can live like this ? off the blood of animals ?
no . but he 's going to be . if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side , i can say to him , `` you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight . '' on that we can build .
now , vera ... uh , simpson , you know my staff dietician ?
you 're not going to let me die , are you ! ? do n't let me die !
oh , really ? that 's interesting . do you prefer cuba or the united states ?
my fault !
he took the shotgun and a light .
you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that .
it 's sittin ' in your apron pocket , right where you left it . imbecile .
no .
you taste it .
[ do n't lie to me . ]
what is it ?
i 'm on my way .
i missed you .
ben damon . christine perkins . sarah darling . tom prinze . that 's four , last time i learned how to count .
where 's that deputy ?
there .
then why am i here ? what did you want with me ?
the day was n't so bad . we all got through it all right .
may i come in ?
madam grusinskaya 's car is to be brought .
give me a readout , dejesus .
naw , man . i just told you , i 'm comfortable . i ai n't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable . you bring your ass out here .
shhh ! they 're sleeping .
do your own mingling . i 'm not hanging around with some dandy named chauncey .
you must learn as quickly as your time allows -- believe me mr. kringelein , a man who is n't with a woman is a dead man .
what happened to `` degrees '' ?
you guys are fuckin ' sick .
this is the greatest moment of your life and you 're off somewhere , missing it .
aw , betty .
the point i 'm trying to make is that this is a blessing . it 's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way .
you probably mean ca n't get right . that 's him over there .
when you get your car together , man , let 's bail .
oh , right . cheating death . there 's < u > one thing < /u > you might try . only one guy in < u > history < /u > ever pulled it off . well , actually two . actually , no , there was that other guy who ... well , < u > very few people < /u > have done it .
yeah , guy banister . ex-fbi man . he died couple years ago .
that 's correct .
i must have frightened her away .
not true .
ten miles back on the texas side .
oh burke ! poor burke !
right . it 's incredible how you do that . remember things .
you ca n't just run home every time things get tough . first of all , we 've got enough dough to --
i need help .
do n't the reject guys get anythin ' ?
all right , all right . its true , what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago ?
that had nothing to do with the world . not this one , anyway .
yes . exhilarating , is n't it !
i want to be transferred to the new paper . you 've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - that 's not what i wanted to talk about .
well , it 's kind of weird .
congratulations , sir .
gloria -- sell the house .
in a word , yes .
someone should hurt them .
i 'm an ape , mom . i 'm an ape . and apes do n't drop lines .
half watch dog ?
there 's a nice-looking little short one for you right now .
yeah ... yeah , i 'm fine .
then why am i here ?
it 's deceiving .
six years ago this may . no one came any more . you `` know better than me , mr. di vita , the crisis , television , videos . by now the movie business is only a dream . the city 's bought it now to make a new parking lot . next saturday they 're tearing it down ... a pity ! ...
do n't lay any guilt on me . suicide 's a personal thing , best done alone .
the busiest land border crossing in the world . over forty-one thousand vehicles per day , twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot . i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through .
i-i can do the job , sir .
boy , you really musta made out good last night .
why , no .
how could you win a crazy bet like --
a little birdie whispered in my ear today ... about the needle-candy you 're chasing . it 's up here ... ... in the old curiosity shop .
i 'm from a small town in slovakia . like the south here . the police is right , a civilian is wrong . so i fled .
something exotic i hope .
take who where ? what you smokin ' ?
it was easy money . i did it in the can . shit ! i learned the junk business in the can , paulie .
unless you get caught .
w-w-whatta you mean ?
i told you . she kills him .
what ?
about a year .
hey ... you got a minute ? hey . he 's got two million in the box , am i right ? okay , you let him keep your jewels . we take the cash and the only other thing he cares about . huh ? her majesty . we go to europe . you dye your hair , get some pl-
and she sure does n't have one now , either . she needs to live .
how 'd you people happen to pop in ?
i was so afraid .
i think it is .
what is wrong ... ?
i sent bobo ten grand of my own money , like it was the winnings from my bets . i hoped that would cover me . it did n't .
for what ?
you were over half an hour late . then all you do is come over here .
what did you say ?
yeah . what are you going to do ? that toby 's a hot head .
why it 's perfectly plain , your the teacher at the college , you do n't want the building torn down .
-- i 've got to study .
now that 's too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you 're gon na have to work this one off .
dad , please stop . please . i 'm sure i know what you 're talking about .
i ca n't . i have to know .
hey , you know . i was thinking ...
i know people .
yeah , icky . this one guy stops and i look in and he 's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey .
please do n't shout .
whoa , check this out . she looks like you .
you asked me to model . remember ?
very good .
i do n't know .
actin ' funny how ?
that 's a probie answer . you 're smarter than that , brian .
forget the deal , jimmy . forget the deal ... you know me . the deal 's dead . am i talking about the deal ? that 's over . please . let 's talk about you . come on . come on . come on , jim . i want to tell you something . your life is your own . you have a contract with your wife . you have certain things you do jointly , you have a bond there ... and there are other things . those things are yours . you need n't feel ashamed , you need n't feel that you 're being untrue ... or that she would abandon you if she knew . this is your life . yes . now i want to talk to you because you 're obviously upset and that concerns me . now let 's go . right now .
what 's happening ?
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is !
i will , sir .
then go to the party . run with the herd kenny . just do n't spew out all that 'be an individual , assert yourself ' crap anymore .
no ! you let us handle this . come along , rool !
keep qui'te , will ya ! shet your mouth !
why do you think she says that ?
you like to call me linda now ?

that 's what they are . three business ... i wait till monday , my time limit runs out .
do n't know , mon . this is a jumpship . not meant for transport .

lori , do n't you understand ? i feel i was meant for something more than this . i want to do something with my life. -- i want to be somebody .
no scaredy-cats in the talamasca , huh ... ?
oh , i get the idea . yeah , maybe .
inside what ?
and when the fog lifted , there 's darren with his head under justine 's skirt .
oh sure .
i do n't suppose you got any idea where she went ?
i could eat a horse .
one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead .
they tore her dress ! ...
then make your choice .
pity they 're retiring us just as i was starting to understand you , spock ...
no .
some indian tracker you turned out to be , tom .
and you have n't made an ounce of progress .
do you think it 's done ?
she ever go with them ? like salvy ?
there 's the script to go back to the guild-
nice of you to join us . i did say three o'clock , did n't i ?
ah-hah .
you do n't want to know , believe me . but do n't worry , i washed my hands ...
yes ! i 've told senator paine for twenty years --
well which of those three ya want fixed ?
yes .
hey . the neighbors .
beaver ? you mean vagina ? -- i mean , you know him ?

... petrov and cicerno for sure ...
what happened ?
i read george jean nathan every week .
you did n't shoot !
i 'm sorry too . he simply does n't belong here . he 's be much happier somewhere else , where he could be constantly looked after . believe me , frederick , it 's better that it worked out this way . good day .
no , it 's just little bingy baker .
morning , boys . ready for a walking tour ?
the kurgan was a pussy .
it 's moving .
how will that be done , exactly ?
i should have told everything right away . i know that now , and i regret it .
all our friends ...
hurry .

i refuse .
why did n't you tell me ? ... . why did n't you hold him ?
so do i .
yeah . i had sex with jake , and it took him like an hour and a half .
no , no , you 're ... lookin ' good . you 've got good color in your cheeks .
what ?
yes ! do n't you remember the day you took that chinese vase from the royal palace and made it into a lamp for my night table ?
but , missus , this is an emergency . it 's a matter of life and death . me friend 's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death .
it seems like such a complicated game .
yes .
maya ? what do you mean ?

yeah , sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years .
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights , but she 's not completely unfortunate-looking .
the bottom line is , i 'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency ... especially after what i did . i lied to this poor girl . lied , man . she deserved better .
i am . i really am . and i 've been travelling . i just ca n't seem to get that far north .
the one to town is , but that 's about it . i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon . i told him who you were and what had happened . he said as long as there 's no infection , you 're not in any danger , and as soon as the road to the hospital is open , they 'll send an ambulance for you .
working hard ?
you killed him -- did n't you ?
shhhh ... !
john bigboot ? +++ $ +++ a black thermopod here ? on earth ? ! why , john gomez ? why ?
what did you say ?
yeah .
he never jokes ... perhaps the professor could use your computer .
he 's buying up pretty much everything : cable companies , baby bells , picture libraries , museum rights , film archives ... getting ready for skywire .
look around ...
no , i 'm going .
yeah .
is that right ?
what do you do ?
obsessive worrier . join the club . and you ? i 'd guess ...
w-w-what are you doing ? !
my mother , boy , she drives me crazy .
rob . please focus .

i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child .

looks like they 've got you strapped in pretty good .
but war does n't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right ?
you punched the president in the face ?
he has taken the presidential suite .
i like to do it . i enjoy it . take you aesthete 's taste to purer things . kill them swiftly if you will , but do it ! for now doubt , you are a killer louis . ah !
i needed to know .
that night , i went to the houmfort . i kept seeing jessica 's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart . the drums seemed to be beating in my head . the chanting -- the lights -- everything blurred together . and then i heard a voice , speaking in a sudden silence . my voice . i was possessed . i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie .
as i said , it is beyond our comprehension .
hey . you feel like a cup of coffee ?
hello , daddy . how are you ?
xxxxxx
dr. david ravell .
i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun .
oh , yeah . actually , i had an assignment in greece and i had to go through bari to get the boat at brindisi . but it looked so pretty i got off and stayed for a few days . breathtaking country .
< b > hey , guy , relax , put out ! you got ta relax , shut your mouth- baby i 'd do anything for ya ! now do n't make me smack you in the eye like last time- < /b >

damone ! you come here ?

general lee , welcome back . i 'm happy you 've decided to join us .

i do n't know what to say to ya ! i guess i just wanted to say i 'll see ya ... or whatever .
you 've cut your hair ?
i 'm sure . he 's dead .
professor !
apparently i can disappear .
nobody knows where he is . we know he 's all right , but that 's all .
... oswald ?
oh , bullshit , he 's a fucking convict . you know how much he hated west --
no -- they 're ... for my grandmother . she 's in a hospital nearby . thought i 'd kill two birds with one stone .
it 's time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border . it 's time to tell the citizens everything . will you write it ?
he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand . he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head !
it 's not going to work .
maybe ten minutes ... that韘 strange .
but he wants me to come !
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city .
see , that 's why you ai n't getting recruited .
annie ... it 's max .

i 'm okay . korda ... went down the side of the building ...
told myself -- if he shows up , we 'll stick with him .
d'you think you and charley 'll ever get back together again ?
i 'm not . i just did n't connect it .
heather chandler , kurt kelly , and rupert `` ram '' sweeney all had good looks and popularity , but there 's one thing they did n't have : values , ambition , and hope .
come in . i 'd like you to meet everyone .
he excels at gratitude .

i 'm positive .
i want to know what 's going on . dolores told me that you and that scuzzball michael fitzsimmons ...

mine have passed on . it 's just the three of us now ...
no . we decided that we 're friends . i mean , i know it 's a terrible word ...
correct me if i 'm wrong - we ! because when i 'm out on this very slippery limb for you , you have to know what 's involved .
i ca n't believe we 're stealing a plane .
this is awkward for me . talking about it makes me feel better .
where shall we go ? where shall we go ? spontaneity is what it 's all about . forget fiji . we ca n't very well drive to fiji , can we ? what about atlantic city ?
zowie ...
that 's a shame , john . a real shame .
it 's hard to say for certain , these things are --
we used pull .
great pipes .
no -- i worked too far north for lrrp .
what ? forget it .
yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that .
no . she asked about the trademark .
tryin ' to get a buzz on . but i 'm too buff . too much muscle mass .
she 'd punish me .
you 're right . only you can do that .
oh , i 'm awful tired . i could n't go through another day like this .
it is so your fault and ... and i guess maybe when we hit the ranch ... you andme better ...
no , i could n't . i feel too close to her .
if the subs are n't here yet , sir --

i could determine if he were dead < u > before < /u > he went into the hudson .

after work ?
well , maybe he has nice friends .
i do n't know . it 's so much money ...

you do recognize it then ?
nothing .

dr. zira , i 'd like to kiss you good-bye .
you still think i kill people , do n't you ?
more or less . it 's part of my college fund .
yes , did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope ? is that why you cut short your vacation and came back ?
my guess is that this little dive 's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime . this is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks .
this one will .
he 'll show .
kit ... maybe i 'd better get a shovel .
guilt . it is a most unpleasant feeling .
but , mr. president ...
annie , paul 's on the phone !

i 've run on . forgive me . we 're here to talk about you .
oh , we germans must get used to all climates , from russia to the sahara . but perhaps you were not referring to the weather .

you have n't told then , huh ?
what -- ?
mmm ...
the power of creation --
mr. president .

that 's right .
your excellency , you must n't forget your appointment at the house of representatives ... have you got your speech ready ?
sorry i 'm late .
stay awake ! you want to go hypothermic ?
now then , let 's run through it one more time , shall we ? what 's your job ?
royal petition , delegates to court , judicial redress , economic boycott , bribery ...
look , i told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house .
we all have our reasons . mine is simply to make them understand happiness , accept salvation , know the serenity that comes- -best i stop . one of the by-products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring . but i know god smiles on me .
she 's fine , as if you cared .
if you 'd read about it first , you 'd have no problems .
foreigners ! fuck !
i 'm going to the store .
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie . for instance : 1. you can never have sex . the minute you get a little nookie -- you 're as good as gone . sex always equals death . 2. never drink or do drugs . the sin factor . it 's an extension of number one . and 3. never , ever , ever , under any circumstances , say `` i 'll be right back . ''
i just got here . talk to you later ...
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
i 'm not goin ' in there , i do n't like the looks of it !
oh sure , pilgrims , indians , tater tots ; it 's a real party continent .

no further questions . thank you mrs. phillips .
... unmarked hundreds ... .
i 've been on my back two weeks . i 'm sick of it .

the girl worries me . if she walks down the street like that , an army will be following her .

who 's watts ?
oh . well , was n't it shakespeare who said : `` when strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again '' ?
you 've come to rescue me ?
tell you the truth , i do n't know . i started when i was eighteen , driving for my uncle cully and his partner , gus . they go into a bank this one time in slidell , gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg . all three of us ended up in angola .

i 'm neither poor nor innocent , but the truth of that particular ...
do n't know on a map . west told us it was there , we just found it . maybe the hurricane took it away .
that 's not bad .
i do n't think so . that was a grunt ; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles . i 'm a trainer . i know what that sound signifies : you 're out of shape .
lasher touched you and you loved it .
jack ... you get to save the girl and i get my third act ! it 's gon na be good for you and good for me !
mr. lundegaard ?
not here ! no overthruster !
that 's the breed ... course it might take time .
i told you , try to stay calm . you 're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch .
i did a lot of singing after that . i sang for charlie - i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that , i did n't -
everything flows from that , and what does n't ... can be easily purchased .
but you should make her laugh , jason . come , make jokes for her . i 'll bring your food to their table .

it 's a < u > sketch < /u > , anna -- it 's not to- scale cartography ; the tree was not the kids ' focus --

why not ?
romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! i conjure thee by rosaline 's bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh ! o , romeo that she were an open ass , and thou a poperin pear ! romeo , good night : i 'll to my truckle-bed ; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep .

is harvard gettin ' all that money ?
go easy .
i do n't mention that anna 's a vegetarian , did i ?
here 's how i see it . i 've got no house , no movie , no gun , and i 'm being stalked . because someone wants to kill me ? no , because someone wants to kill you . so now , starting now , i go where you go . that way , if someone wants to kill me , i 'll be with you , and since they really want to kill you , they wo n't kill me , they 'll kill you . make sense ?
dammit , man , it appears someone is stealing your ship !
what 's wrong ?

that 's blackmail .
it says she was originally schooner rigged , but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine . i think square rigs look so much more romantic .
since sixteen or so .
you 're out of your mind . we ca n't do a job like this with no rehearsal .

where 's my gun ?
just a minute -- your wife knows her own name , does n't she ?
dignan , he 's my brother . i ca n't just leave him there .
how 's that possible ?
they wanted to know if we 'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night . they wanted to know if you remembered anything .
who was she ?
but one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the king 's law .
well , officer -- do your duty .
< u > she < /u > did n't try to conceal it .
a hanger .
i must be . but i 'm not . your home . this is your home .

i know that . but --
what the fuck.. ?
she needs help .
you have to dial nine first .
goodbye .
comin ' up the central reservoir .
okay . i feel like i 'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they 're slipping because their standards are so high ?
but i 've seen her grave .
yes .
what difference does that make ?
cut the crap , you 've been taking the man 's money for years . now it 's time you earned it .
-- but he does seem very nice .
so that 's why casper is how he is .
but why ?
i set up fisher with the broker that found his house . took care of that one , did n't i ? prison communications .
last july i dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident . they asked me what number means `` good luck '' in jewish .
our next d.a . -- i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser . did you get your invitation yet ?
i 'm not sure , but it did n't involve getting blinded with poison .
you talked to him ? ! is he mad ? did you tell him ?
they 're putting me on film tomorrow .
for good luck honey .
please.. you should n't laugh --
he ate his fill , and was forced to continue eating ... till his body rejected the food . the killer held a bucket under him , and then kept serving . he took his time . the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours . the victim 's throat was swollen from the effort , and there was probably a point where he passed out . that 's when killer kicked him in the stomach . popped him .
hell , i do n't belong here . i do n't know what i ' been thinkin ' .
what 's wrong with it ?
good swell .
by god , i 'll fight the lot of you
you think he 'd believe it if he did ?
the youngest applicant by eight years .

god ... that 's in a week !
o'neill just tole me . it 's sooo great ... i do n't believe it .
well , i 'm really am most awfully sorry but i ... i can explain everything ...
so , things change . the government has moved to the circus . you 're going to fight last . and commodus is going to fight first .
where is it ?
nothing ?
i have one question . how could a kid who wails on the drums like it 's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say ?
what was the bottle that did it ?
lots of history . for example , did you know , according to legend , this coastline used to harbor sirens ?
what do you mean ?
surely i have made my meaning plain . i mean to avenge myself upon you , admiral . i 've deprived your ship of power and when i swing round i mean to deprive you of your life --
nothing personal .
really . you think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf ?
you 've got an inferiority complex , you have .
i feel lucky tonight .
treason . against whom ?
there sure is ! i 'm going to tell you somethin ' ... i was n't going to speak of it ... but i 'll tell you now . did you notice them scalps strung on scar 's lance ? did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance ? long ... wavy hair ...

... which i hope will make you very happy .
so ?
i get it !
who might these friends be ?
christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives , just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people .
the fabric of life . the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another .
the one that slept in my mouth last night .
you 've been training two years to take me out . here i am , the big , bad vampire hunter . so do it .

no . i mean yes .
wreck is a harsh term . disturbed is more like it . mildly disturbed even .
never mind that . what 's the story ?
i love every square inch of it . but i can feel the edges closing in on me . a man 's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this . so what do you say ? join me ?
they perpetuate mechanical living , sir . they limit your mind .
screw the flashlights . where the hell were you ?
a bikini ! i 'll need to buy a new bikini , lex . c'mon . after being cooped up in that prison , have n't you thought about me in a bikini . . ... once maybe ?

hey . . . hey . where did the building and loan move to ?
yes . he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect . it held that evolution was n't always gradual or driven by natural selection . the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a `` monster species '' . it made no sense . but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster , living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years .

excuse me , general , but may i ask how do you feel ?
i spend a lot of time on e-bay . buying , selling -- sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up , sometimes just selling crap i find in the street .

find a chaplain .
you did n't kill her ?
yeah .
well , they sure did n't ask us to come forward and tell the truth .
no . you 've got me all wrong . i mean , in you own pussified way , you actually got some nuts in your little sack .
do you know her ?
think of the scientific data we 'll gain . come on , lets get out of here .

but -- who -- what -- ?
kid , you gave them what they wanted . this committee , it feeds on names . the more names , the better . but for some high-profile witnesses , like yourself , any name will do .

looks like those boys are headed south , so they were n't the same ones that jumped me . which way you going ?
that 's why he has the parties , he says it 's like bringing the world to me .
i 'm fine .

yes . as i said , i could n't keep my eyes ...
our other dinner guest .

nothing further , your honor ...
definitely . two days . that 's the industry standard ...
o-kay . we 'll cook up some soup and put it in a coke . sick , eh ? now should it be chicken-noodle or bean-with-bacon ?
i 'd like to .
remember how we were ?
i 'm meeting someone .
i hope the dragon of the north sea gets you and your lord .

hey , i 'm just waiting for cousin itt to show up .
if you do n't want to be so appealing , why did you touch the rose to your skin ? where was it ? here ?
i came up here to sneak a smoke .
see , ray , this is what we call `` good cop , bad cop '' . she shouts , i stand up for you , you 're grateful , a bond of trust is established .
at first i was n't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before . but i found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to `` the other world '' and neve do . it has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that 's sending signals .
rug samples .

this is strange . do you feel it ?
this is so weird . it 's happening , but it 's not . it 's like a tv show , and we 're part of it .
i 'm an investment banker . i see blood bathes everyday . besides , mine is not to question why , min is but to do or die .
well , okay , you 're not privy to all the new shit , so uh , you know , but that 's what you pay me for . speaking of which , would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash ? i got ta check this with my accountant of course , but my concern is that , you know , it could bump me into a higher tax --
hey , mr. executive . buy you a drink sailor ?
then this is it .
silence , romulan !
everybody shut up .
i do n't know .
i take it you learnt to live with yours then . take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being ...

oh , i ca n't stand it .
no , i 'm just going to head home .
i do n't know . i kind of thought i ought to be here . you know , this is n't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from .
and you think this creature is one of them ?
that 's really romantic .
i have always thought about her and missed her .
okay .
the three of us are going to do some traveling . we 're going to take your car to el paso .
then what are you complaining about ? look , we have work to do . when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges . `` first , the breath of god . only the penitent man will pass . second , the word of god , only in the footsteps of god will he proceed . third , the path of god , only in the leap from the lion 's head will he prove his worth . ''
nothing . why , do you think i should ?

the wounds are the same . cauterized . no chopping or half-measures either . one stroke took the head . have you seen , doctor ... ? even the spinal bone ... sliced as smooth as butter .

now how the hell can i help you ?
i 'm fine .

with your permission ...
trade re1ations .

under the stone in the floor .
is it ? william says now you have requested a british commission , why not colonial ? i 'll clear it up for you , sir , because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that , it will even get you into polite society ! your dream come true , george , the only dream that really matters to you .
we 'll get a tail put on him .

i mean , nicky 's a made guy and i 'm not . i ca n't do that .
salina , kansas !
i do n't know . but he did die . starks falters under the news . jackie looks around , through her now blurred eyes , like she might find some help in the apartment . she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table , lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink , then laughs nervously as she looks up .
they bloody hurt me .
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil , now it 's insignificant burgel . if indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you 're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all .
we got word from chicago . they got one of the grifters last night . the nigger .

who was that person mother ? was it you ?
all new people start with that ...
then you have to trace it . michael , people here look at me as a reliable man . i ca n't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man . but you know all that ; there 's nothing you can learn from me . you should n't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner .
i know you saw me .
i said , i ai n't got you ...

in my town , when i was little , there was a brute , a bully who terrorized the place . but he was not the problem . he had a brother who was worse than he . but the brother was not the problem . one or the other of them was usually in jail . the problem came when they were both free togther . the two became different from either alone . alone they were only brutes . together they became lethal , together they killed .

i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ? i was walking toward somebody who did n't have any idea who i really was . and it was only half the other person 's fault , because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted . so it was good that i did n't go through with it because it would have been a lie , but you -- you knew the real me .

the targeting sequence should take about four minutes .
then who goes ?

the ultimate expression of evolution , it reproduces asexually . think about it , all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction . that 's why he came to new york . like every species of insufficient progenitors , he 's nesting !
i 'm sorry .

so did i ... .
i do n't know ... me .
what ?
you were behind the door ?
if those corpuscles can take on air , no reason why we ca n't . all we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about , and when benes inhales , there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank . how 's that sound to you , skipper ?
clark , it 's lois . this is the fourth message . i 've left . . . where are you ?

no problem . a pair of deuces ? less ? so what ? i bluff . it used to tear me apart when i 'd get one of my men killed , but what was i supposed to do ? break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ? of course not , so i bluffed , and after a while , i started to fall for my own bluff . it was great , it made everything so much easier . sarge is that why your hand 's been shaking ?
i 'm just --

you know what 's in the bag you 're taking ?
no , have n't heard of it .
no -- we do n't want this case in court .
state your case , mr. prosecutor .
go on , there 's a good boy .

he finished it . he wrote the worst notice i ever read about the girl he loved . we ran it in every paper .
what the hell ... ? bork ! that bus we picked up . where was it headin ' ?
to begin with , your methods of dating the past are crude , to say the least . there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations .
this game is pretty important to him . he made all-stars in high school , you know .
why you got ta go and do that ? i 'm trying to make a point .
same old daniel .
you got an 8-track tape player on purpose , just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin ' opera .
no way .. not me , mister . i 'm not going up there again . might find someone 's prick in a hot-dog roll .
you do n't move soon . i 'll begin to decompose .

and do n't be shy about your english . you speak better than a lot of people i know . take care of yourself .
the vice squad ?
because she 's sick .
this was n't your first time , was it , ted ? how many we talking ?
who did you bribe for your visa ? renault or yourself ?
nothing is the matter . i 'm having a great time . show me some more .
dude , this is smokey . look , i do n't wan na be a hard-on about this , and i know it was n't your fault , but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gene and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round . or maybe forfeit it to us --
he married you , did n't he ?
who are you ?
they never find that girl .
thirty-four seconds !
how did you know about that ?
it 's a little late .
perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad .
how is it ?
their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum .
would n't be funny ... listen , i 'll be back in a while .
yeah . maybe .
show some compassion .
i just want to get it over with . my mom 's making me do this . i just want to forget it .
jesus christ ! listen to yourself ! i ca n't do it , grace . i ca n't do it .
oh -- commander . i did n't see you ...
yeah , can you believe it ?
do n't spend too much time searching . you ever vetted somebody 's old code before ? it 's a different skill . stay close to the surface . the best-hidden secrets are in plain sight . you know the best place to hide a leaf , right ? in a tree .
keeping your word is something i can actually respect , ted .
where are you ?
or ... ?
wait , i want to say good-bye .
ah , there 's something poetic about the simple processes of labor . counterpane , blanket , blanket , sheet , sheet ... it should be set to music !
just to be certain , i wonder if you could show us a list of your patients ?
that 's what he said .
... but it is good . you know , over to the left , you can ...
what are we waiting for ?
look . i been fightin ' , mister . i been fightin ' for what feels like a hundred years and i 'm finished . i do n't need religion . i do n't need prayers . i need a couple guns and a couple hands . we can sail on outa here . find another island where there ai n't so much ... .traffic .
meet point 's up ahead !
well , someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of mrs. rosson 's cabin this evening -- even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched . get me ?
it 's sunday .
yeah , this insurance business is too slow for me . i 'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai .
`` wake up , your highness '' - we should start getting used to saying it .
briefs .
i did n't say anything-
and before ?
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty .
uh , no , i did n't know that , brad .
not a clue .
we 've got to keep moving while there 's still light .
just wait a second . wait one second . okay . what are you doing ?
i do n't know . i hope craig got a good idea . we got ta ask him when he comes out . let 's go and clean up before pinky gets here .
thea , your choice is a very simple one . either you want to claim him as your father , or you do not .
activated .
really .
i 'm not jealous !
well , the sheriff found < u > two < /u > batteries in your well . if you left one with carl heine , how is that possible ?
miami beach is the only place for a real hustler . florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world . they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes .
what 's going on here ? daphne - daphne -
it 's three years old , it --
oh , that 's a relief .
but if elliot harmsway is involved with that uranium , i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth .
er . well , nowhere special .
sugar-lips shapiro ! frightening , ai n't it ?

ash ?
islamic .
push 'em back .
walter , listen , i 'm at my place , i need you to come pick me up --
god , you two are sensitive . all i 'm doing is implying some sort of sordid , ugly , sexual liason . why , i 'd be proud of that sort of thing .
what 's wrong ? is everything okay ?
klaus tauber .
shut up , you ninny ! you were never to come here again -- for any reason whatsoever !
you 'd < u > heard < /u > of aids in 1984 , 85 ?
what 's he joking around for ? he 's been shot .
i 'll take some laughing gas , ma'am .
when we backed you --
pass .
harrington .
you look like dogshit .
look , i talked to him and it 's not going to be a helicopter - they ca n't land on top of the roof - so they 're comin ' with a big ... limousine bus and they 'll take us to the airport - and they 're gon na get a jet ... so things are rollin ' ... they 're movin ' ... i also ordered some food ... i got some pizzas for us , all right ? i got some things to drink - i got sodas ... i even asked them for aspirins ... i 'm doin ' what i can ... now i got ta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills ?
we 've got seventy-five rounds for your glock 9 , but only twenty for the sig sauer , one pair of visco glasses with monitor , plenty of passports . you said it yourself -- if i 'm not dead , i 'm with you .
come on , baby-bear , open this door ...
they 're yours .
`` ex-cia '' ? there 's no such thing as `` ex-cia , '' john -- they 're all ivy league establishment . is he one of these guys with a beef against us ?
maybe because you 're shot in the leg .

i do n't think , he ca n't ...
cherry bail bonds .

it 's ok. just have him bring you to dinner at mr. chow 's later . we 'll be there .
we got a party tomorrow night . ca n't have the place smelling like shit .
just get outta my bed .
you always get what you want ?
no .
trip , you fuckin ' asshole .
hello , anna . delighted to meet you .
because i got off to a wrong foot with my own thing , you know . b-b- b-but i need a dramatic change in my life . father you 're gon na believe in jesus christ ?
we all know you 're gon na get over with the insurance money anyway ! ya know da deal .
i hope to go up next year .
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up ?
like hell , you did .
i. yes . it is .
then i guess this is where we part ways . sorry .
hey , do you think you could eat me if you had to ? and if so , which part do you think you would find the most delicious ?
funny , i never thought of you that way . you were so close too . we were all pretty stupid about you .
thanks a lot , buddy .
let me get you some help , truman . you 're not well .
for the same reason you are .
you could n't come up with something a little more discreet ?
i 've been called everything under the sun , jerry . call me whatever you like .
you used to carry a gun , did n't you ?
to go up .
hell , man , that do n't matter . we 're loaded . we were big wheels in the black market in seoul .
article 42 ! you do n't mean- ? !
because i found out about her ...
i 've wondered , diz -- maybe this don quixote 's got the jump on all of us . i 've wondered -- maybe it 's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me --
they never kill themselves . how do you know it was him . you never met him . you never even saw a photograph ...
it 's orange !
no . they are here -- somewhere . a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs .
the clitoris ? ! i did it ! ! i found the clitoris ! !
it 's the only place i 'm happy .
jim , pat , mick , what the fuck . long as you remember you 're not at lords .
you do n't know what you 're getting into here .
we 're not going anywhere .
that 's illegal , you know .
that 's not food . ca n't be food .
... i will .
leave . go .
actually , no . i 've got everything under control . i 'd like to clean up myself a bit . i 'm going to take a bath . dinner 'll be ready in about a half hour .
no , no , of course not . you are young ...
god -- could have killed me -- bad girl , nell ! how did you know to do that ?
no weirder than a sharp , young , good- looking woman working in a lumberyard .
it does n't matter . i think about you every day .
what ?
with the compliments of colet and company !
obeah evil . i not evil .
my mare is saddled and ready ; who 's the captain 's second ?
yeah .
he did n't tell you to cut all your hair off ... !
little boys . looking up my skirt as i danced . giggling .
like that !
he 's three . why do n't you wait till he 's a little older ?
go hard !
you bet ya , coach .
as recent as we have .. what ex- actly is your interest in amber ?
we did not .
you were there to help dr. marx deliver her baby . were you not ?
i do n't think there 's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks . next time , we 'll design a bigger one .
did you ever own a saw ?
not to terrify you , nigel , but it 's worse than you think- i 've never even seen one .
i work in the immigration department there .
it was n't difficult . only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone . i see you brought along the female of your species . i did n't realize a man could be monogamous .
right .
i said it . is n't that enough ? do n't forget to write !
but could n't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat ? the same person who planted it in cotton 's car , framing him ? the same person who really killed your mother ?
put the fucking kettle down . tell , yuri , tell him put it down or i 'm going to make him .
so modest .
as we near the pole ...
kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas , so we figured , give 'em a cheap thrill . walter supplied the decorative touches ...
i only have your word for that .
that pain is hunger .
so you lost the job . is that what you 're telling me ? he just up and fired you ?
what -- what 's on your mind ?
how do i look ?
are you crazy ? what makes you think you 'd survive ?
this is a gift you 'll not return .
why should everyone dance the same way ? it 's as exciting as watching fungus grow .
hope for the best ? i do n't understand all this skepticism . i thought you liked rose .
i should 've told you it was the blood of christ ; you 'd believe that , would n't you ?
she coulda killed me last night .
i 'm hungry .
left here ! left !
they designed the ship from watching you . so ... take her out , lieutenant ...
all right .
stand back .
let me get a little action started here .
yeah .
no , man , just wait .
fine , now .
oh , your excellency , is n't there something i can do ?
do i get a country-western name ?
sam , give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit , will you ?
i think you have the wrong number .
how ya doin ' , ainge ? evenin ' , lily .
i want to come in , and see if everybody 's okay .
good move : when all is said and done , she 's nothing special . i saw her taking her pants off and i definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there .
it 's home .
buy it ? they 're paying for it . and around here that 's how you really know they buy it .
having considered my position here at court , i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign .
you open your mouth and stupidity pours out .
... you know , chauncey , there 's something about you ... you 're direct , you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly . you do n't play games with words to protect yourself . i feel i can speak to you frankly ... you know what i was talking to you about last night ?
shut up , merle ... williams .
look , i got nothin ' against you , but you 're in trouble here . all you got ta do is tell us when gondorff 's gon na play his chump . we come in at the sting , make the pinch , and you walk out free as a bird . no questions , no court appearance , nothing .
aw , i do . but 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin ' . it 's the whites that need it real bad .
oh ! i thought maybe we could have a drink together ?
no blood vengeance ? no re-proach or insult ?
actually , i already work for you . or did . your arboreal preservation project in south america .
carla pestalozzi ? no . definitely not . you could have posed for the mona= lisa . sophia loren looks swedish next to you .
i just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates . so scientists can come back and study it and find a cure . so that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth .
no , that 's quite all right .
i 'm a forensic specialist , molly . you 've seen my diploma ? i got a diploma and everything .
... that 's fine .
alright , i will .
if you do n't like them , why wo n't you be more concrete with me ?
well ... to be honest ... i 'm really crazy about you and it 's making me nervous and when i get nervous i 'm not myself and i 'm afraid i 'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure .
listen to you ... the old `` mouth-to-mouth '' resuscitation routine , huh ?
you lied to me .
uh ... i mean you 're on right after this act .
no .
victor .
no , no . i on holiday .
i will . i 'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five , okay ?
they are english . they do n't understand .
have you ever felt like this about anyone else ?
what kind of place is this ?
are you going to be able to sleep ?
i 'm jack dawson .
hi , ma .
i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us , that 's all .
ouch . come on , do n't bust my chops . i know it 's corny , but i do love it .
oh , jeff , give me a break . you did n't even have the guts to go look in the van , did you ?
do n't do anything rash , please , benedict .
just remember two things . first , the law is a living thing . it made us free and it keeps us free . sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes . sometimes it makes mistakes , sometimes big mistakes . but in the end , the law prevails for the just . sometimes , it takes a while .
i promised them i 'd ask you where west and the others are ...
he 's beautiful .
sir , i ... come to beg you to confess all , and swear allegiance to the king , that he might show you mercy .
like what that moses guy did to that pharaoh guy ?
read < i > mein kampf < /i > ? hitler had all his best ideas in prison .
where 's ricky .
i guess ...
when i opened up the blue envelope , all that was inside was a blank piece of paper .
wait a minute , wait a minute , let 's talk a deal , superman . we can take a lunch on this --
i 'm probably not interested in whatever you 're selling .
no ...
maybe pants .
nice tent .
and after the steak ... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama 's picture to the wall ?
i 'd like to live a little longer but -- i 'm not afraid to die -- i 'm not ...
right .
current levels may not be sufficient .
i said i would get you to your ship and that 's where we 're going to say goodbye .
why did you do this ?
did i promise that ? i do n't remember that ...
listen , you 've got ta keep this a secret . you ca n't tell a soul . promise ?
my documentary is due on tuesday .
that would give us only three seconds to revive him ...
hey , mister . mister . i just . . . i just wanted to thank you .
give me the gun .
can you imagine , if dickie did kill freddie , what must that be like ? to wake up every morning , how can you ? just wake up and be a person , drink a coffee ... ?
do me ? do me like this , you mean ? like chainin ' me up ?
well , sure i would , but -- aw , i 'll bet you 'd be scared .
i was doing my job .
kay ... kay ...
leave him behind !
those are ancient history .
i still do n't think it 's loaded .
man 's rep travels .
i said let 's go , charlie .
draw .
no , not so fast . we have nothing concrete .
guess there 's no way i 'll ever know . for sure .
yes -- 'hildy , darling ' . i 'm just a fool . that 's what i am . i know what it 's going to be like .
yeah , that 's out of context . okay .
well , that 's something never happened to me before , you can bet your bottom dollar . uh , where 's the matches , ma'am ?
i 'm all right . i just ca n't stand to see people tied up . i 'm in the waiting room for hours , listening to noel screaming . the only reason he 's screaming is 'cause he 's tied up .
or we could write `` expletive deleted . ''
another free program off line . what 's his user s'posed to do -- ?
what 's it all about ?
the letter --
thank you , thank you . you know my son , do n't you ?
what are you doing ?
you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles . you know who filled that bag for you ? not alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself . men with guts filled it , by god -- men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles -- suffering , ingratitude , loneliness , death --
mr. gittes ...
it is truly , what抯 the word ? inspiring .
let 's just say he burned me once .
do n't think .
pigeons ... it 's a sign ! if clear 's right about the order , then nora and tim are going to be attacked by pigeons !
i 'll do nothing of the sort .
sure i do .
farewell , ancient lady ; farewell ,
yeah . i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it .
how many times do you want to hear this ?
you 're not accompanying him to new york ?
ca n't do what ?
look at me , hildy --
worked my black ass off , first as an intern , then worked my way up to this position .
cross my heart .
i just know - any minute he 'll find out , we 'll barge into somebody we 'll - and it will ill him .
what ?
rita . i met her last summer . she 's cool . you 'll really dig her . she 's got this great little cabin in the hills , just outside of provo where she raises chickens . i 'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us .
well , i do n't have any money . . .
why do n't i make you some of this new mococoa drink ? all natural . cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua . no artificial sweeteners --
you 've really got a problem .
there 's nobody here . jason ...
they 'll have me . teach them . do n't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history , without philosophy , without meaning . teach them of the greeks , the babylonians , the hebrews , the numidians , the egyptians and the great romans . teach them , who we are !
what do you expect us to do -- shut down the city , evacuate two million people on a hunch ?
peerless , i did n't raise a buffoon . we have enough of those on television already .
i 'm not burying him here ...
would you like a glass of chocolate milk ?
nasty .
funny , jack . i抦 laughing on the inside .
well , over the next seven days , do me the favor of remembering it .
lord forgive me.. they already know too , much..
uh -- forget that . look , is that all you 're interested in ? ways to get your girlfriend into bed ?
seventy-two clients . one stayed . jacket on , tie in pocket . _ 44 .
i 'm maybe about six ... which would make her four .
your boss got a serious problem , bill . real serious . we know what 's been going on at your office
okay .
do you love her ?
yes .
then i 'd say you 're a lucky fellow .
the whole town 's in an uproar . we 've got to find him . the letter 's our only clue .
-- he wo n't .
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department , so do n't be worried if it takes a while --
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .

donovan asked to see you before you leave .
it 's hard to swallow .
well , you got the first down -- there 's one more to go . come on , we 're ready to start right now . come on . just keep stiff .
uh , do you mind if i wait ? i really need to talk to her .
now , now , do n't fret .
no further questions .
mom , mom , we need to be more constructive here . i do n't see this as a gender-related issue . she 's still tense . we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening . right ?
i have to finish my job --
ucla ? my cardigan sweater period .
i 'm still not clear on chaos .
yeah , you .
well ... ... you see , you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
i could not come . i had other responsibilities .
i need you to interupt him , i need to get him on the phone with me right away --
my father was a great man , you know . there was nobody he would n't help . you know that crazy guy noel who i gave water to last night ? he lived in our house for almost a year . a total stranger he 'd do anything for , his own family though ...
that is so cool .
you抮e wrong about my being there , though . carlos borrowed my car that day , his had broken down ... leon saw it , like you , assumed i was there , thought he抎 wait to ask for a lift . but carlos turned up , with the tape you found ... leon got his lift , and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out . he watched it , confronted carlos , threatened to tell the police about the hotel ... i don抰 know how he knew about the hotel . perhaps carlos talked too much ... my husband did not tell me ... you more or less guessed the rest ... i didn抰 know any of this before you left for los angeles .
do n't you know ?
irena . but who are you ?
... popescu ...
has he been prepped ?
why ?
if it 's alright , i 'm gon na pick up the rest of my gear .
a gang of terrorists seized the eiffel tower in paris
you seem a little hinked-up ...
i was n't made for this .
well now , mr. stone , did you make up your mind ?
je ... sus christ !
i know , i know .
how could witwer have accessed the case file ?
as an unmuddied lake , sir . clear as an azure sky of deepest summer . you can rely on me , sir . deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass . he groans and retches .
because she will lie ?
we 'll see about that .
to the other side of the street .
yeah , it 's gon na be a great picture ! you 'll love your character ! bunny , bela 's here . look , hit the bars , work some parties , and get me transvestites ! < u > i need transvestites < /u > !
the usual -- a girlfriend .

oh , baby , you cruel ...
she ca n't hurt you any more .
well , mr. proudfoot , this call came in past three in the morning . it 's just hard for me to believe you ca n't remember anyone calling .
actually , i 've decided ...
you 're attractive , tita . if you just did a little more with yourself ...
and what exactly do they intend to do ?
mild stroke ?
immediately . is this the daily news ? melanie daniels . would you get me the city desk , please ?
she 's still alive . he 's adapted his freezing technology to reverse mcgregor 's syndrome . he 's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease .
do n't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that . you do n't want to look shifty , do you ?
i did n't even scratch the surface . you 're lucky , boy . you come home , and nobody 's here . when i go home , everybody 's going to be there .
bullshit . it 's all coincidence .
yeah ? ... well , i gave 'em a taste of american lead ... and i do n't see 'em coming back for seconds !
not a very good one , but --
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ?
look , spare me the macho bullshit about your gun ...

ball park sausages .

sit here , near me . i am an old man and can do no one any harm .
chosen me ?
... what ?
you 're right , i was n't looking to fall in love with a casino worker . i 'd given up trying to find anyone . but there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart .
we have to .
well , i -- it 's just -- i do n't know , a user , i mean ... users wrote us . a user even wrote you ...
the sex is better .
for the record , whenever you hear me sliding out of control , i 'm never alright . when i secure the line , come on up .
at least i would n't be pulling the trigger .
good idea , o lord !
you 've won with the two chips you placed earlier , but the third chip was a late bet .
no thanks ?

you are about to witness something few have seen -- watch ! watch !
i 'm not trying to pull against you , cooch . i 've just been having nightmares about the way leo was killed .

wait a minute , walter . you ca n't do that !
you handle your front office people , i 'll handle the press and leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board .
well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .
have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband ?
this better be good
no shark fin , no camel hump . what you listenin ' to ?
nyah , you 've done more than enough . even the best of snake charmers get bit .
a undercover cop has got to be marlon brando . to do this job you got to be a great actor . you got to be naturalistic . you got to be naturalistic as hell . if you ai n't a great actor you 're a bad actor , and bad acting is bullshit in this job .
he 's fine .
who was paying you , dave ?
we 've found all of them .
not very .
captain there 's someone here to see you - he 's waiting in your office .
would you like to sit down , joe ?
but i do n't want to be like that . i want to do something ...
seeing you were her sole benefactor , and i 'm the executive of the will , kirsty 's entire estate would have to be donated to the city .
that would be totally out of character . helping people is against my principles . see , he definitely does n't know me . now , i 'm going to go back and listen to my father 's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science while you torture this intruder to death .
you put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate ... make him spin out ...
going nearer to god !
how could she not be real ? i can smell her , taste her . she does exactly what she did ... it 's not possible .
they get some turnout for this stuff .
four years . girl , i 'm surprised he did n't ask you to marry him .
just watch me . if anything weird happens - like if i start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here , you got ta try to bring me out of it . his me over the head if you have to . just do n't let me leave .
at the bus station . he said i 'd be a perfect call girl . and that he knew an agency in california that , on his recommendation , would handle me . they have a very exclusive clientele : movie stars , big businessmen , total white-collar . and all the girls in the agency get a grand a night . at least five hundred . they drive porsches , live in condos , have stockbrokers , carry beepers , you know , like nancy allen in `` dressed to kill '' . and when i was ready he 'd call 'em , give me a plane ticket , and send me on my way . he says he makes a nice finder 's fee for finding them hot prospects . but no one 's gon na pay a grand a night for a girl who does n't know whether to shit or wind her watch . so what i 'm doin ' for drexl now is just sorta learnin ' the ropes . it seemed like a lotta fun , but i do n't really like it much , till last night . you were only my third trick , but you did n't feel like a trick . since it was a secret , i just pretended i was on a date . an , um , i guess i want a second date .
who 's this guy ? this is n't who we 're looking for ... her name was hannah .
do me a favor ; take a picture of me with her .
it 's a letter from her lawyers .
i have not , but i very much want to . what do you know about the trouble in devil 's cauldron ?
well , i 've been accused of many things , mrs. mulwray , but never that .
no , it 's weird , man . nobody knows where he went .
to our brave guests . few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes . we are blessed to count ourselves among them .
granny 's dress . oh , mom .
not at all . your highness , may i present madame yakushova ?
i am not comfortable with this . i 'm not a good liar .
yes , sir , i 'll do that .
what 's he talking about ?
that wo n't work , chick . this boy 's honest , not stupid .
i 'm gon na have this stuff sent over to the hospital ...
i 'm not fucking angry , for god 's sake .
do n't you have a kiber crystal ?
everything 's gon na be okay , sweetheart . do n't be upset .
dear christ ...
no , just not the type .
because i love it so . it 's beautiful there . especially at sunset . ah ... thank you for the fire .
why ca n't they just shake hands and be friends ?
what a relief !
yes . very good .
i think you like learning .
invulnerable .
i 'm afraid she 's going to walk .
oh , man , there you go again .
why are you looking at me like that ?
we run . you crack the pattern ?
it-but it-it ... does n't make any sense . he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound . so-how is it possible for oswald to have fired from two angles at once ? it does n't make sense .
whatever it is you 're upset about .
those cowboys messin ' him up ?
god , you ... you 're mean .
you try that you little monkey .
fucking . i 'm talking about fucking , harold . you ever think of fucking other women ?
i do know , gary . i feel the same way . i thought i was coming here for a job . but it 's meant a lot more .
you do n't give us our due credit . our scientists have done things no one could ever do before .
uh huh .
better reassure him .
youse so fucked up man .
you < u > slut < /u > ! no sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair .
yeah ?
the shopkeeper on 13th street wo n't drop the lawsuit -- he still claims one of the lasers we fired at the jenkins gang burned down his store..
that 's me .
we could n't have done it better ourselves .
sure . let 's go home .
okay , seeya .
uh , hold on ...
but there 's this < u > psycho < /u > . really . mom , there 's a psycho i have to deal with < u > every day < /u > . i do n't know why they let a psycho even go to school !
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin . it often bothered him . so i looked for it and i found it . gim me .
i 'm in charge of the conversions . when first bank buys another smaller bank , i 'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things .
no , i do n't want you going on the street .
i 've got frank ... frank earl 's son . he 's ... he asked me to get him and i did --
we went over to johnnie 's place just to check it out and it was busted up , bad .
i do n't know . any new bodies accumulated out there ?
oh my god . what 's wrong ?
absolutely -- what time should i expect you ?
oh , dollface , it was just your passion for me taking hold .
you are much younger , and much more handsome , than your pictures .
oh , my poor stomach .
okay . in that case ... i 'm at the airport in nice .
see the tape . then we can discuss reconciliation . rex screwed up and i nailed his ass . now i 'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it . then i 'm getting on with my life . that 's all i 'm after .
oh , it 's nothing .
because we 're fine here . i do n't know what mary told you about me , but i do n't need company , i do n't need to be looked at .
how did you come to have my address ? found it , did you . among her things .
yeah . but , hey , anybody who 's not `` comfortable '' with the rules , you 're free to walk , anytime . seven digits poorer , goes without saying .
she 's an awfully good reporter -- i ca n't remember her getting too much wrong before , can you ?
you ca n't hold it by yourself !
he was a computer program for crissake .
you baby sugg 's kin , ai n't you ?
pony 's coming here to the corner ? !
i ... what ? are you , are you , that 's why ... ? are you nuts ? i 'm ... i 'm going to close for you , i 'm going to ... here , here , i 'm going to make this office ... i 'm going to be back there number one ... hey , hey , hey ! this is only the beginning ... list ... list ... listen . listen . just one moment . list ... here 's what ... here 's what we 're going to do . twenty percent . i 'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales ... twenty percent . for as long as i am with the firm . fifty percent . you 're going to be my partner . fifty percent . of all my sales .
so you 're telling me it was one guy with six guns ? a-and he was a senior fucking citizen ?
you ca n't get no loaf a bread for a dime . we only got fifteen-cent loafs .
what you just did for laszlo , and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him . i know a little about women , my friend . she went , but she knew you were lying .
wallace 's followers .
i got your message . that you were trying to get me -- right ?
what ?
you are frightened , no ?
i 'm sorry that was out of line .
why are you saying that phrase over and over again ?
he 's blunt , but he 's got a point .
he was here . you fell asleep . we took him . you looked so exhausted , frankly , we did n't wake you . besides , the young woman , julie , is with him . believe me , everything is fine .
ho-yah . him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun , above great river , near eagle rock .
yeah , well , i think i 'll stick with what i 've got .
yeah . but i 've got gorignak staring me in the face . i think i can take it though ...
after i left ... when i was in california , i began to think , what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child . it got to where i could n't tell anybody about billy -- i could n't stand that look in their faces when i said he was n't living with me . finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to billy and to me and to the world how much i loved him ... and i did ... and i won . only ... it was just another `` should . '' ... sitting in that courtroom . hearing everything you did , everything you went through ... something happened . i guess it does n't matter how much i love him , or how much you love him . i guess it 's like you said , the only thing that counts is what 's best for billy . i do n't know , maybe that 's all love is anyway ... ted , i think billy should stay with you ...
what are you doing here ?
be sensible , martins .
sure -- and they record your voice . and later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder . that 's out !
suffer ? we 're living in america .
run for your lives , boys ! it 's that great two-gun dog-catcher from kansas !
i am a suicide risk .
marcia , why are you doing this to me ? do n't you know i 'm scared enough ? do n't you think i remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books ? you think i 'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness ? i 'm doing this because i have to . now , i 'm leaving for colorado to try to finish this and i want your good thoughts -- because if i can make it work ... i might just have something that i want on my tombstone .
forgive me for trying to be nice .
i will as soon as i get the sand out of my nose .
hello , venkman .
you like ? it 's all yours .
what 's that pounding ?
george is a hairdresser , is n't he ?
i could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but i waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs .
pardon my french , but bull shit .
and after that ?
you抮e too good for him .
that 's right , 'cause it 's an important issue .
i work better alone . why do n't you do some snooping around the set ?
let me show you ...
you 're not my therapist . you 're hear to study me . face it 棗 i 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you .
what do you mean ?
terrify me ?
we are with the police department . this is sergeant sykes , and i am --
i ...
six thirty -- and he was very much alive .
this is it , james ... what you 've been working for .
we have a deal worked out with irvine .
your friend ?
you takin ' his side ?
i just had a drive ; besides , i want to see my brother-in-law michael .
tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus . probably did n't de-stem , hoping for some semblance of concentration , crushed it up with leaves and mice , wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit . fucking raid .
what i need this for ?
we 're standin ' on broken treaty ground , ray . this ai n't supposed to be here . it 'll poison the water .
he climbed when he was ready .
where were you ?
-- took a bus .
negative .
and what was the weather like at this time ?
when you have a lot of time to think , it 's funny who you remember . it 's the people who challenged you . it is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning . i never told you how sorry i was about what happened after we returned .
you talked to iris ? when ?
i do n't think so .
goddamn it , i ask you a question , you better answer it , or i 'm gon na blast a hole in ya !
that 's the idea , rat . that 's the attitude .
i 'm sure we 've met .
did n't you see < i > raiders of the lost ark < /i > ?
sal , just this once , do me that solid .
you would not believe what --
what makes you think he 's my friend ?
what 's wrong ?
i 'm sorry , sir , we 're not allowed ...
could n't make the last edition . it 'd take me four hours to translate your story into english .
no doubt you would , baron . but do you know , i 'm quite indispensable to her . i 'm her ballet master and her nurse . i hardly belong to myself anymore . but , there you are , it 's grusinskaya -- you ca n't help adoring her .
any particular reason ?
i got eyes , do n't i ? how my not gon na see something like that ?
that is my permiso .
mookie , i always liked you . not the smartest kid , but you 're honest . do n't make me dislike you .
we 'll ask evelyn . evelyn ? evelyn !
what ?
`` blood , sweat , and canvas '' .
i 'm ... just looking for parry ...
oh , twenty-four hours , give or take , staying cloaked . after that , admiral , we 'll be visible -- and dead in the water . in any case , we wo n't have enough to break out of the earth 's gravity , to say nothing of getting back home .
that 's right .
i think we got a couple of live ones .
he did n't hang around us . he 's like one of those hippie kids . i 'm not part of that group . it was a party in all these rooms . his girlfriend who i barely know was completely hysterical ... he 's blue , he 's puking ... we did n't want to get in trouble , but what were we supposed to do ? i mean , what would you have done if you had been us ?
a piano ?
christ ... where the hell is the bathroom ?
you know , i made a reservation at marco 's for peter 's birthday dinner , but maybe you should cater it .
oh ! oh , zeke ! help ! help me , zeke ! get me out of here ! help !
yeah , why ?
no . not at all .
the heck d'ya mean ?
but he 's never said a word-
come on -- let 's take a swim .
i know how he feels .
you paying for the gas ?
no .
aye , sir .
tom ?
you better heat up that miracle * you were talking about . we broke through on number six , and the electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer ...
we 're hungry do you have anything to eat ?
i had him in view . i was peeling over the egg , into a dive . he saw me when i moved in for the kill . there was n't any danger ...
suppose i 'm not exciting enough for you .
i had a good teacher . mclean versus urban transport ...
that has n't stopped you before .
two fifty-three , five --
but there were more of you ?
you 're so sweet .
this sophistication ai n't tough . all it takes is a credit card .
he said he was the brain trust . said he was smarter than all of us . he started reading `` atlas shrugged , '' staring at himself in the mirror .
maybe he 's that one in a million !
if i do n't have a sea anchor i 'll capsize .
what do you want to do ?
every morning .
never leave home without it . lee , this one 's on me . you save your money .
i do n't want to . it 's different .
wait , wait . you do n't believe the dead guy , do ...
we got your black ass now , washington , wan na bet another twenty ?
she seems pleasant enough .
thelma , i 've lost my wife , i 'm not losing my child .
what ... what must i decide ?
yeah , man , male , significant other , whatever the fuck i am .
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries .
but , jake , i was just ...
christ , i have n't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 .
: what are you up to ?
oh , your majesty , it would be such a tremendous honour !
as far as i can tell , the guy 's what he says he is - alone , and unarmed . all he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public .
you lost someone .
oh , sure .
a cab ? ma , come on . my car 's just a half block down . you wait here .
something 's wrong here . your friend lando is very charming , but i do n't trust him .
if you do n't , we will . it has to be total , deckard . that 's an order from as high as it comes . got it ?
what kind of talk is that ? so you got a little over- emotional -- but you 're fine now .
jeffrey . are they important things ? well forget me - you have to tell him . jeffrey . i mean it .
hey ! fuckin ' a ! time to roll ! ! !
`` oh ! ? '' what is `` oh ? '' what does `` oh '' mean ?
why would you ask if it 's a guy or a girl ? !
yah , ya think ?
yeah , i 'll bet ! so , how 's it going with what's-her-name ? dana ?
about the girl .
einstein . had two marriages , both train-wrecks . the guy never saw his kids , one of whom , i think , ended up in an asylum --
do n't touch that car .
marty , i know i 've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future , but ... .well , those loud bangs on the tape recorder ... .are they ... .
we were sent here and you know it . others have been sent here . where are they ? hiding ?
take a bow , steven , you 've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me .
what kind of exercise ?
son of a bitch !
'go ! go ! go ! '
there it is !
well , you know , i 'm not gon na kick so easy . i 've got a few things the other girls did n't have .
but you 've just taken care of the spirit all right .
i judge military matters , captain winthrop , not you .
make them eat the figurine .
well , i gu-guess they had it ... comin ' .
he told me about you . that he had no other friend like you .
and three years after the royal wedding , the king abdicated . is n't that terrible ?
yes ma'am ?
if i 'm so all-used-up ben , why do you try to hook me up non-stop ?
wait ! professor ... ?
something is gon na hit your butt if you do n't quit complaining .
fifty shillings . pounds .
... i 'd say around nine-thirty . somewhere around nine-thirty .
i know what it is . she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle . inside there 's a silvery ring ...
it 's beginning ... .
it 's made from cherry . that 's a hard wood .
the answer 's not in the box . it 's in the band .
i ca n't help it . it just keeps ringing .
you want me to buy dead cat ? it 'll scare people away .
do you have many patients , doctor ?
norman !
you hired jackson and rudy. , not me .
do n't be afraid to say hello . your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase . so i 've taken on the task .
they let you out ?
really ?
her name is gretchen .
it can be done . take two days to shop ; one to prep . i 'll offer up my bible for a small fee . you also have to hope kip 's jerk-circus did n't undo castlebeck 's linkage so much so that he 's setting up surveillance teams on every city block . and then get yourself a crew ...
would you step outside , sergeant ?
talk some sense into him , will ya ? you 're still his brother . if he ai n't gon na listen to you , he ai n't gon na listen to nobody !
y'know what ? i 'm ready to cancel our trip . i really am . i 've had it .
this is insane ! ca n't you see what 's going on . the killer wants me out of the way . he 's setting me up .
she comes along too .
you said it ! how about a little action ?
dan , great to see you again . like i said , you need anything at all , i 'm your man . i do n't envy your job . i mean owen was a ... complex man .
his car 's still there .
you think you could find me a pencil and paper ?
-- an investigator for the internal revenue service ?
sartorius wants to destroy it .
aye . that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells . oona ... lure her out . play the part of a girl-child .
gary , do n't worry , we --
tonight 's the night ?
small talk .
why not call for help ?
we had just gotten away from the cops . he just got shot . it was my fuckin ' fault he got shot . he 's a fuckin ' bloody mess - he 's screaming . i swear to god , i thought we was gon na die right then and there . i 'm tryin ' to comfort him , telling him not to worry , he 's gon na be okay , i 'm gon na take care of him . and he asked me what my name was . i mean , the man was dyin ' in my arms . what the fuck was i supposed to tell him , `` sorry , i ca n't give out that information , it 's against the rules . i do n't trust you enough. '' ? maybe i shoulda , but i could n't .
[ beat ] i 've seen a time that 's not this time . and i 'm only able to see it when i 'm in the jacket .
oh no .
he means the last that we know of .
what , you think i 'm made of money ?
so did your father ...

i brung you a little basket of goodies . fresh squash , tomatoes , some okra , butter beans .
whose then ? lindsey ? talk to me ...
no . why should rose be in my room ?
my own undercover feature - `` written by josie geller '' .
trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on earth .
i tried to borrow a gun from chad , but --
no , i 'm through with that shit . ashley 's right . got ta start doing something i got a stake in . get a business going .
maybe i 'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does . or maybe i抣l snap its ugly head off .
-- what car ? -- go to sleep .
you have n't even looked at them once .
if you had n't been gassing about hoagie ... .
dave , these things get awfully complicated sometimes ...
so , he put aside some jewelry for me . a lot of jewelry .
dude , somebody 's on the rag .
i ca n't believe the way you guys do business out here . i ca n't believe how fucked up your organization is .
no problem . thanks for letting me crash . it was the best sleep i 've had in months . i used some of your soap .
you were rich before . this is the first time i was ever rich .
i do n't care what kind of mood you 're in at the start of that song . when it 's over , that mood has been altered . wow . great shit . what 's next ?
i want to talk to you , pierce .
satchmo .
he keeps asking me questions about you . do you know him ? do you recognize him ?
who 's my real father , man ?

that thing 's not going to get us down there fast enough . face it , he 's dead .
she 's a ho cause she 's sending her coochie through the mail .
it reminds me very much of this one . nicht wahr ?
where 'd you say eric is ?
sorry . i 'll be on the bandstand .
thirty-three --
i do n't care what his family 's like or if he does n't have any brothers , but he does n't have to lie to me .
i mean first you 'll pretend not to care , not call -- whatever , and then , eventually , you really wo n't care .
hey jeff .
what do you need ?
that 's wrong , sam . you know that . we 'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years . this is never going to go away ...
that 's terrible .
greetings , mr. george .
frida , i 'm your friend . i 'm not judging you ... you did n't sleep with the creep did you ?
yeah . i feel real up to it right now . come on , david lee , you and me 'll do the loading .
`` i saw you waiting there , by the gate . ''
that 's mcdermott , but yeah .
oh . oh , you 're sorry are you , well you must think i 'm awfully stupid . he slaps alex in the face .
damn . now i got ta go in early .
if you want any - there 's some left in the kitchen
i can not tell you . suffice to say is one of the words the knights of ni ! can not hear !
we 're gon na do it , boys . gon na get ours . feel it in my bones . all we have to do is keep our eyes on that brass ring .
your brother stumbled upon adonis抯 little secret , didn抰 he ? and traded his silence for a kid and some cash . and adonis fell for it , bought him his kid , sent him away , and then killed him when he came back for more . leon didn抰 come here to borrow money for prints . he came to extort a second kid抯 life . your flunkey let him in , so his visit couldn抰 be concealed , hence the exhibition story . there was no exhibition . just as you suspected . remember , deborah ? 揕eon does his own prints . wouldn抰 want anyone to interfere with his 慉rt挃 . i should have paid more attention to your words . perhaps it抯 the way you say them ...
why do you always focus on the negative ? did n't you see how friendly she was to you ?
we loved each other once . have you forgotten that ?
how did you she was a nazi ?
for bravery .
the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people 's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .
you 're mocking me , are n't you ?
neighbor ! doctor ! i live across the hall .
you 'll tell , or you 'll be back in that corset ! come on !
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .
you 're a window rattler , son .
i should n't really - i 'm not your surgeon ...
good work , my brothers . fan-fuckin'- tastic ! i think that interview stuff 's too long , we can lose some of that . keep the girls , keep the long hairs , keep the hun brothers , keep the black guy , keep the movie shit , and keep the cop at the donut shop . lose the rest . and cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that . cut it after i ask , 'i take it by your answer it was a whole new team . ' do n't even let him answer . fuck him . then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in dr. reinghold laughing .
what ?
you 're kidding .
no . it 's got ta be more than that . that hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart . too powerful .
i need very little sleep . we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange . i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs .
keep it .
and locked it .
my brother says the guy 's a thirty- five year old virgin , so maybe he wo n't know how women usually feel . plus he 's got bad eyesight , almost legally blind , which is helpful in this situation . plus he 's got an extremely small penis , of which he is `` mortifyingly ashamed '' , so chances are he 'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention , that he 'll be yours forever .
you women are crazy !
all right gentlemen , let 's get down to it . i need to know if you 're for real .
do you ?
i do n't care . cretin .
how am i supposed to not get excited , listening to you trying to extort your employee , you sarcastic prick ?
exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks ?
what 'd you say ?
you might not think it to look at me now , but there was a time when i was at the very pinnacle of my profession . the horror movies were behind me . i 'd done `` show boat . '' major success . great box office . now i was to do something important . `` the road back . '' an indictment of the great war and what it did to germany . it was to be my masterpiece .
who ?
and that 's another thing . you could lighten up a bit , yourself . this severe routine is getting old . smile once in a while .
she most certainly was not !
1 , 2 , 8 hit , did n't it ?
what ?
that 's swell . i like you , lloyd . i always liked you . you were always the best of them .
karen , i 've been with the bureau fifteen years , on all kinds of investigations .
congratulations .
hello !
< u > yes < /u > , for my wife , what the hell kinds of questions are these .
all right ! might save me a lot of leg-work if i could just talk to your mother . but i 'd need a warrant for that , wo n't i ?
time is running out , dana . soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and vigo 's . well , mainly vigo 's . but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship .
you 're out of your greedy goddamn mind .
you 're wrong , mr. stone . there are people who live and die without e'er seeing it . they ca n't see the country for the money in their pockets -- and some think their state 's the country , or the way they live is the country , and they 're willing to split the country because of that . well , i hope you 'll meet all those , when you 're grown . you 'll meet the fire-eaters and the circassian beauties -- that 's part of the fair , to be sure . but if we 'd had to depend on them , in a permanent way , the country would have stopped at the allegheny mountains .
ever ?
he wants to kill us !
and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer . steve how do you think i realized i love you ?
how long do you think you 've been here ?
a sponsor .
me , too .
we must abandon .
my mind 's lovely . and yours ?
that 's the plan .
no .
could someone have hurt you that bad ?
you 're late .
yes . no . both . when i was a boy , i see movie at school called `` it 's a wonderful life '' directed by frank capra . ever since i want to come to america . land of the free . home of the brave . a land where anyone can be anything . as long as they are white .
what do you think ?
you were . infantry right ?
scout 's honor .
no , madame , it 's the way you < u > follow < /u > .
i thought you were my mother .
got another twenty years in it , boy . by the way , son , do you recall rose , that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion .
you did n't happen to be going to worth 's place , did you ?
i have n't quite made up my mind yet .
so we 've got guns , kitchen knives , pipes , fire and sticks .
good . she 's been through it before . me too . you were too young to know about it . you better wait outside ; there 're some things you should n't hear .
why are you here ?
father , i 've lost respect for you . i thought you were a man of principle .
i could see you were pining away --
do they come in dreams , these visions ?
you fucked up , glen .
yes , of course . my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism .
radiation shield , you think ?
it 's gone . i feel it !
what the hell are you talking about ?
it 's just a party . daddy , but i knew you 'd forbid me to go since `` gloria steinem '' over there is n't going --
brother earl .
it 's called sarcasm , dr. rosen .
i 've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed .
what ? you want to fight ? over her ?
i know you do n't uncrate your emergency ship unless there 's a fucking emergency .
i *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future !
but , we 're all going to heaven !
no means yes .
well , they 'd be very stylish in finland -- just before you froze to death . begin to get the idea ?
no way .
yes sir !
sure you do n't need one ?
then if emma turns me down will you marry me ?
that 's okay .
what ? ... oh suck my fucking dick !
have you fantasized about me ?
mother ? but your mother --
i wish you were coming with me .
two pounds , fourteen ounces .
there is no --
which part of no do n't you understand ?
you must n't speak of ...
wladek , stop that . it 's over now . just be proud it happened . my god , did they put up a fight .
she dreamed this would happen ...
i do , please .
disney ! how inter ...
you blabbed , quaid ! you blabbed about mars !
yes .
think about it .
you do n't have an investigation without me . you got that ?
hey , wan na ' share a soda ?
really ?
why ?
do n't tell me that was any meteor shower .
her own people start to suspect her , it creates discord from within . the warriors do n't know who to trust , they start infighting , and jimmy loses his support .
-- who can say . he 's off his onion , y'know , he 's old school sicilian , this is how they hate .
california .
corrado , why do n't you ask them to give it to us as a gift ?
you better have that looked at .
can i have the gun ?
hello .
don ? where is he ?
yeah . ah , i do n't want to panic you or anything , but , i mean , the way hobbes designed them , they 're supposed to get out of hand real quick , so you do n't have much time to think about what 's happening to you . once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream ... i dunno . but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive , maybe even bizarre sexual things ...
well , that 's all i can do . sorry .
i say it because it 's descriptive .
i 'm positive .
to tell you the truth , not very much . i can not lie . i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially , but otherwise ...
what is he up to now ?
we 're taking this ship out of here ... this mission is over ...
but here 's the thing . i retraced your exact steps according to your statement . you could n't have seen detective eckhart from there . i mean , not in that fog .
if ... if ... when we get to san francisco ... if they 're already there ?
yes , madame .
well , rose , going out to look for a job today ?
maryjane . we call her m.j .

you do n't know the procedure .
mmmmmmmph ?
you 've got an awful lot of orders in you . always giving orders .
that somebody out there knows what it 's like to be ... in here .
come on !
put it down , i said ! it 's nothing for you .
oh my gosh , i do n't think she 's even wearing underwear !
you 're weird and i 'm afraid of you . seriously , cassandra , there 's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework .
he fools around with his patients too .
yeah , well i guess you should 've .
could you tell me how to get there ? the exact location ?
what should we do , sir ? the time is running out .
you walked ?
yes . seriously .
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part ? have you any idea how humiliating that is for me ? i 'm an actress ! it 's about our marriage for fuck 's sake . everybody knows that ...
... it 's kind of a pro bono job .
do you always transport through the air ?
is he here ?
of course not .
what do you do to him ?
can i talk to hearst ?
goodnight .
i am king , d'artagnan . i will change my mind as i wish , and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish !

of course , of course . well , any time , just drop by .
jesus .
martini .
yeah . mall madness , huh ?
you men are all so dreadful !

i certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one .
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs , major , and if you 're walking me into a trap-
tell that to private james ryan . we 've got our orders . let 's go .
right . hey , shut up . okay , sir .
one toy per kid is doing something nice . four is ... something else .
he sold the feed to me , did n't he ?

roger .
hey , bud .
excuse me , ladies . i 'll just be a moment .
and you stand aside while we drive it in , then shut the hatch , launch the boat , and --
do you want me to work the case , phil , or do you want me to --
it 's poison gas , this is the antidote . drink it .
right . just remember , mates . billy baird 's the name . anything you need to get , move or watch , i 'm your man .
but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you .
you getting scared ?
but there 's so much to tell you --
what do you want me to do ? pick up after five dogs ? i 'm eighty-three years old . god in his heaven understands that i can not pick up after five dogs .
you 're coming .
all this nothing ? it does n't get to jake like it gets to me . he says he do n't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
so . wide cross-section of men to evaluate . and the day that the defendant volunteered for this ... demonstration . did you find him eager ?
you mean you have finished the whole investigation ?
no problem .

uh ... it 's ... uh ... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ... ah ... take certain license in depicting the cover scene ... for ... ah ... purposes involving the ... ah , market place .
melvin ... i 'd like to know exactly where we are going .

it you really loved me , steven , you 'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds .

you 're years away ... i do n't know why you 're thinking of these things , much less talking about them . want to try ?
this guy 's kinda dorky lookin ' .
you 're a drunk and an idiot .
no , wait , no wait , that 's too much , man , that 's like overkill , nobody can take that much , you 're wasting it -- !
i do n't know .
did he bring that with him ?
ro , how long have we known each other .
because i would n't want you to do it unless you really wanted to !
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge . i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people .
i , uh ... changed for dinner . i get dressed for all my meals . except breakfast and bath-meal . boy , it 's hot in here . mind if i open a window ?
who 's to say he ever will ? he 's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone 's toes -- in fact , i 'm the only one he trusts and he would n't even look at a document if it did n't first come through me .
course not . he ai n't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him . he 's there 'cause he back sassed a free man . they got their rules and we ai n't got nothing to do with that . woulda probably happened to him sooner or later , to a complainer like him . he 's got ta learn the rules same as anybody else .
yes , you lost your control .
coolin ' her jets in a holding cell .
um ... look , there 's something i 've , uh , that 's been bothering me for a long time , and i just thought i 'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here , and that 's this .
she said i was so much like you . i said , no , i 'm not . i 'm like i am because of you , but i 'm not you , not as good as you . everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder . but you saw the better part of me , the part of me that could be like you , and changed me . you made me who i am .
you got it , g.g .
my stockings .
i could give it some thought , ben , but my leg is very sore .

we just do it ... we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do , i guess ...
three days later , he called me . he told me to meet him at overlook park .
half and a dollar .
nice . very nice .
can you tell us what 's on the disc ?
you 're the psycho ! you have n't been able to deal with anything since high school ended !
answer the fucking question !
oh , shut up . i thought it might help you get some sleep .
aaah , let me tantalize you . you 're a top operative , back under deep cover on your most important mission . people are trying to kill you left and right . you meet a beautiful , exotic woman ...
i flat do n't like the guy , glory . he 's dirty . and i 'll tell you something else . you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan , on a little item known as the salt creek land deal . it was after the war . van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where van ryan wanted it .
i understand . pity to mess up a nice clean boat .
shit . i meant the other way around .
i was talkin ' with ya man , mike . -- hey , how come i been put outta my locker ?
in the name of elric , prince of elves , demon begone .
why ? why have you got to go round killing and looting ?
uh ?
he filmed his victims .
well , what 're your ideas on these guys ?
quite . any childhood friends ? enemies ?
but you think about him -- it -- her .
thorgan , quit screwing around and come on !
when ?
looting and pillaging , eh ?
look at me .
we are simply respecting the terms of the seventeen point agreement .
yup . that 's him goin ' . i love to watch him go .
come where ?
we 're working for the king .
a lame ?
you ought to stop this nonsense , loretta , these two dollar bets .
yup .
yeah , that was honza 's idea , i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear .
i must speak with you , miss flaemm .
... i do .
no , i ...
what 's on your mind ?
what ? !
yes , i did -- but you tricked me into signing it ! you told me my soul was nothing ... that i could forget all about a soul , in exchange for money . that was a lie , a lie , a lie .
they said you 're the one .
you mean ... the laboratory ? ?
ride like wild fire , jack .
it 's < u > freezing < /u > .
< u > listen < /u > ! we both got something out of it , all right !
i beg your pardon !
yes . i did n't confess today .
the bridge ... ? i 'd better get going !
dance ? tonight ?
i 'm a blimp .
shrink , actually .
you 're lying .
what 'd you want me to do . stay at home , twiddlin ' me thumbs . doing sweet f.a . [ fuck all ] .
but of course ! please make yourself comfortable . perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar , or une petite glace , or -- ?
if the police focused their search in her room , her belongings , well that 'd be only natural , but they may have been looking in the wrong place .
no -- he 's lying .
you 're right . we did lose a million dollars last year .
not because you have to .
who ?
i am the liar . where should i take you ?
not to me ! i was n't fucking married to her !
we missed him .
no , that son-of-a-bitch walker is alive .
hi honey .
least i could do for a captain of the enterprise .
it 's all right ... charlie , let 's move outside .
i 've made arrangements with dr. gynde for 10:30. but jeffrey , you 'll have to walk over ; i need the car this morning .
i do n't believe it 's right for you to involve a boy who 's not seventeen years old yet ...
yes .
he 's fine . we 'll come right over .
no , captain , please .
thank you .
yeah .
i suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels ?
hey , you wan na test my limits , you better line up a couple dozen women on the ground ... cause i got no limits in the air !
yes , hello , i wanted to place an ad . hi , are you craig 's wife ?
we done ?
you 're never going to believe this , but the canyon road ... we were on it not two hours ago ... well , it 's completely ...
he thinks he is . he says his mother was apache , but i suspect he 's lying .
fuck you . you owe it to me . tomorrow i 'm gon na wake up and i 'll be fifty and i 'll still be doin ' this . and that 's all right 'cause i 'm gon na make a run at it . but you , you 're sittin ' on a winning lottery ticket and you 're too much of a pussy to cash it in . and that 's bullshit 'cause i 'd do anything to have what you got ! and so would any of these guys . it 'd be a fuckin ' insult to us if you 're still here in twenty years .
johnnie ?
you always get to go first .
barks his agreement .
sure , they will , they will . we 'll have a - - coupon day or something .
what ? oh , yeah , sure , if you want . i tell you , every letter this guy writes to you is the same : they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography . i dream of your thighs , the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire , while i , aroused and inflamed -- '
s.o.p..
her cleverness , that hard edge -- maybe they 're the weakest part of her . the strong part is ? what 's underneath . the part she was protecting . there 's no reason to protect it ... i think she 's just finding that out now .
duh . i 'm in your class at school .
tomorrow
pick up a burger for fred . he 's going crazy .
no . why ?
a drink ? i 've got some nice gin . if you 'd prefer something else , they 'll send it up ...
the clock 's already ticking .
but how do you know ?
but ... just to be sure , maybe we ought to shatter each other 's unrealistic images of perfection . you know , each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves .
come on , you ! before we slap you down .
it 's desperate that i talk to her .
visitors ? some friends maybe ? someone you talked to ?
yeah -- why --
you ... i should 've killed you myself . should never have left it up to him ...
well , i can certainly understand why you left him .
tell me about it . name 's kyle troy . ca n't we bring up the bass .
we went to chapel for vespers .
you do n't think i 'm good enough ?
the woman you 're stuck on .
you 're repeating yourself ! that 's the speech you made the night you proposed. `` -- any time -- any place -- anywhere ! ''
i just ca n't seem to focus on anything these days .
robert del rio ?
i 'm in , too .
well claire do you ? have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them ?
there has to be a threat of some sort , nobility of some sort , glamour of some sort , sport of some sort . these elements are lacking .
they ca n't come in , right ? unless you invite them . is that true ?
anywhere but here . i 'd just sit here and cry about the way my father 's been forgotten .
departure angle on viewer .
no harm , no foul . but you want to watch out for that road . those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night .
i told you , the octopus is made of rubber . this is a piece o ' cake .
i 'm gon na do you one better . i 'm trying to marry you . you want to marry me ? i 'm serious . i mean , i - i want to settle down . i want a family .
down to your heart . i 'm gon na clean some fat out before you drop on me .
three , four hours .
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . you 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .
a little more so this time .
what can i say ?
that the virus was taken from philadelphia to san francisco , then to new orleans , rio de janeiro , rome , kinshasa , karachi , bangkok , then peking .
yes , well , i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem . i 'm bringing in some people from upstairs .

near the top of the hill , you 'll see the school and right behind it , the church . you head for the school . now just past the school , you 'll see a little house with a red mail box . that 's where annie hayworth lives , she 's the school teacher . you ask her about the little brenner girl .
i think i liked you better when you kept your trap shut .
the prince of darkness .
come out , come out wherever you are ...
i do n't know shit , man ! goddammit --
he 's your brother , you figure it out . maybe he made another bomb .
i do n't understand ... the holy oil of clovis ... it was quite full the last time i saw it ...
she 's a programmer ?
because i think they 're after you .
well , what do you expect from a pig but a grunt .
every last bit of it . the big guy 's room was empty .
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ...
poor taste . i know . listen , i respect homosexuals . when i was young , my maid was a homosexual . my maid was a homosexual .
... it 's like a visit from my oldest , dearest friend .
then why are you compulsively eating ? if you 're not hysterical ?
repartee , dick -- very good . hey , i feel ten years younger ! it makes a helluva difference , let me tell ya ! how 's the lawyer life ?

grandpa does not own a t.v . have you noticed ? there 's no t.v . santa carla has no malls , no cineplexes and now i wo n't even have mtv . i will not know anything hip happening anymore .
roman , from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way . honestly though , tell us , what's your favorite scary movie ?
you do n't have to eat the carrots . just passed a pond with some ducks in it .
maybe i do n't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here , but i do n't work the same way .
money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns . because when money and guns get together , there is violence ...
give me that gun .
okay , you two , have a good life without me . i got ta go .
this is really nice . makes me feel like a kid . i want to do somersaults .
but even < u > after < /u > you had an attorney . you still claimed to know < u > nothing < /u > . claimed < u > not < /u > to have seen carl . am i correct ?
then we 'll find another way .
no , do n't do that .
you do ? is he a funny uncle ? 'cause if he is , then he and i got somethin ' in common .
look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
only a fully trained jedi knight , with the force as his ally , will conquer vader and his emperor . if you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path ... as vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate , despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now .
she 's got enough money to burn this whole department down .
there 's a car following us . probably another one flanking us the next street over .
that 's all you got to say ? `` yes '' .

since the initial transmission , there 's been no further contact . just the beacon , every two minutes .
i can do it , captain .

if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese .
how many terrorists have you met ? actual terrorists ?

we 're not gon na do that now . we 're not gon na do that now and that 's over .

it 's a big building where the generals meet . but that 's not important right now . they 've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid . is n't that good news ?
stop it , stop it , stop it .

yeah .
i think you have the wrong number .
personally , i 'd prefer stupidity .
i 've forgotten .

i 've had girlfriends , but all they wanted from me was weed and shit . shit , my grandma used to say , `` which is better : a good plate with nothing on it ... '' no , wait . i fucked up . she said `` what 's a good-looking plate with nothing on it ? ''

why did n't i listen to my mother ... why 'd i have to go looking for trouble ? any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position ... what 's < u > wrong < /u > with me ?
well . there 's the bible story . god took a rib from adam and made eve . maybe men chase women to get the rib back . when god took the rib , he left a hole there , place where there used to be something . and the women have that . maybe a man is n't complete as a man without a woman .
oh -- here you are , baron . a drink -- a louisiana flip ?
but i 'm going insane ! all these people do is pray and work , work and pray ! i do n't get it -- when 's the weekend ? they have gruel , eddie , that 's what they call food ! gruel -- it 's like alpo for nuns ! i sleep in a cell , on a board , and i pray five times a days do you know what i pray for , eddie , do you have any idea ? check your crotch , eddie -- anything fall off yet ? get me outta her !

george , i 'm afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide . i see where we 're headed , you 're putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold ...
as you observed , a primitive culture .

what exactly do you mean by that ? i do n't understand .
directly , mr. president . this wretched man , the accused , is only a pawn in the conspiracy . we know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture . the state charges that dr. zira and a corrupt surgeon named galen experimented on this wounded animal , tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...

ah , but therein lies the paradox . it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents . the longer she is away , the stronger they become ; and who , honestly , can promise security against that ? however many doors you lock , someone will always get in . even here .
stop ! get back ! ! she has the weirding way . why did n't you tell us ! great gods ... if you can do this to the strongest of us you 're worth ten times your weight of water . as a leader of my people i give you my bond : teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary . your water shall mingle with our water .

it would be the beginning of the end for my family . how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that , and then give it to them ?
jesus . do n't ask questions like that up in the wine country . they 'll think you 're a moron .

poor missy . god , i was sorry to hear . i remember when she was no older'n ellen there , walking down to the store with her raggedy anne doll draggin ' behind her in the dust . i do n't know why god takes someone like her , who should have a bunch of years still in front of them , and lets an old shit like me just go on and on .

do you dream ?
no . they would never do that .

i have smarter men .
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .
interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic , by the college-girl mentality .
i told you . he tried to steal our gold . he tried to kill us .
in time . but mirabile dictu , do n't you agree ?
go away . i might hurt you .
what does he know about the highlands ?
you have every right to be upset .
'lying . he was lying . ' i asked you what you thought , not what he did .

god damn it i 'm sick of you calling me `` meat '' ! you wanta step outside !
you miss the good ol ' days . even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they did n't have to . and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat . those good ol ' days ?
wait a minute ! no buzz ! this way ! there 's a special ship . i just saw it !
i knew she would intrigue you .
we have done something -- hell , we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it 's the only one in 2000 miles , y'know .
`` ungrateful fool . . . ! '' those were my very words to myself last night . `` here are these people in shangri-la doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and i have n't done one single thing to show my appreciation . ''

cia policy ? the cia has no policy , mr. helms . except what i dictate to you ... i try to adjust to the world as it is today , not as you or i wanted it to be ten years ago .
he wants me to break a leg ?
i blame tony pee-pants !

me and tiny , we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle .
the zoo tells me that chimpanzees , like all apes , are vegetarian , sir .

she 's right . if you two are doing the horizontal polka , the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around , knocking over furniture and calling you `` daddy . ''
you get to your feet in the senate and present it . then you take the bill and put it in a little box -- like a letter box -- on the side of the rostrum . just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in . clerks read it and refer it to the right committee --
i understand , betty . i understand perfectly .

jesus christ , pop . you got two hours until your plane leaves .
you know - i had a job once . i used to work in a bank . i had been training ... i used to have a boss ... mr. don frio ... he wore a toupee ... i wonder if you 'd hire me if i came in here and asked you for a job ...
you 'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again . you used to eat it up .
you have to say that .
you 're late .
that we did . john . but the horicane is near trapped out .
of course , the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more .

first , let 's get something straight . we ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime . if you want to kill yourself , mr. case , there 's much more entertaining ways than working for me .
once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school . it took me only a day and a half to finish it , and i got paid six million lire . ever since then i 've been doing estimates for other people 's designs .
i feel like a jerk .

terry , what 's wrong ?
you do n't s'pose one o ' us has it , like the man said -- i mean , that 'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein ' vet'rans o ' the same war 'n ' all .
you got it ? ! you got it ?
our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago . even if they stayed in the car , the grid is huge . this is it . he 's trained -- conditioned -- they 're built to disappear . you give him another day to run and we may never find him .
sonofabitch .
how could grendel records sign such a wick-prick ? i guess julian grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob . i hear ray charles is going to head up the video division .

and now is definitely not the time to bitch up .
map is kinda dirty , monster ...
good night .

my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet .
you 're pressuring yourself ...

you take the cake lloyd . come on , she 's not here . let 's check out her psycho ex .
ahhhhhhhhh !
you 've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man ? ? working at him ? ? turning him against thea .
it was n't a suicide attempt . i regret ever saying that .
you be our guest , jack .
yes , it 's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer !
there 's not a moment to lose ! wake her up , but be gentle about it ! this woman is mankind 's most precious possession ! she is ... perfect !

i 'd better go on home now , it 's late . i have to work tomorrow .
underwater ?

i 'd love for him to get a good education . that 's it .
okay .
let 's just go sailing , okay ?
how 's it going upstairs ?
in a minute !
hrummm ... and where are you off to , now ?
... necklace ... pearls ...
i took the bandage off yesterday .
he does n't want to fight .
i do n't know . someone who ... knows about this kind of stuff .
you have a free tongue , captain hamilton .
no , thank god ... just missed him .
i promise . we 'll talk . you 'll be great . you 'll be fine . go ahead , just imagine that , uh ... just look into the lens and imagine you 're talking to me .
no . no , you 're not hurting me . but i think you better quit it .
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds ! they took the idols and smashed them . the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos . and who have they got now ? some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
how about a hippopotamus ?
... i have to stand up for her ...
his name is andrew . i know that guy .
after glenn was finished , he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home . the next day , i finished my shift and met him around back , like we always did . i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest . three or four times .
no . no , it 's ok. i ... it 's my father .
you 're even sadder and more burnt- out than i thought .
is that true ?
i 'm on vacation . on my way back to school .
what do you want me to do , johnny ?
no , mr. white . pierce morehouse patchett . now , i sense you 're on your best behavior , but that 's all i 'll give you . if you persist , i 'll meet you with my attorney . now , would you like miss bracken 's address ? i doubt she knows anything , but --
you little shit . when did they get to you ?
to old madrid .
jesus , what 'd you crawl through , a sewer ?
do you have a good answer ?
i 'm not lettin ' no one go .
he does n't know you 're up there ! just stay right where you are ! call the police !
you too .
you got this under control ?
my mouth -- my mouth !
really ? bulimic headcase .
: ... finer spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black .
listen , i know i 'm just being neurotic , but i ca n't shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary , ms. fagina . i mean , i do n't want to sound paranoid , but i 've had some bad relationships in the past , and i have some jealousy issues . you went to her penthouse . it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities , but i ca n't help but feel this weird , irrational , unfocused ... well , jealousy . i 'm sorry .
he 's got my grandson , sanchez .
and his soul black as the ace of spades .
you stare at him non-stop , like every lunch . like this . like most people stare at car accidents .
rule of thumb ?
oh , come on , amado --
just a minute , neighbor stone . i promised you money and all that money can buy . i do n't recall any other obligations . but let 's look at the contract .
father , i was n't disputing you .
we 've got a full crew , but we can squeeze one more , right .
do n't forget your towel .
citizen kane there 's your title .
okay , i 'll drive you around there some day . ouch !
not a clue . you ?
no tom , just listen . all my people are businessmen ; their loyalty is based on that . one thing i learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think ... and on that basis , anything is possible . fredo has a good heart , but he is weak ... and stupid , and stupid people are the most dangerous of all . i 've kept you out of things , tom , because i 've always known that your instincts were legitimate , and i wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice , for your own protection . i never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under sonny ; i know you were in a position of limited power , and you did your best to advise and caution him . what i am saying is that now , for how long i do not know , you will be the don . if what i think has happened is true ; i will leave tonight , and absolutely no one will know how to contact me . and even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary . i give you complete power : over neri ... fredo , everyone . i am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children , and the future of this family , solely resting on your judgment and talent .
indivisible and inseparable .
but besides the operation , we 've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf .
well considering what a colossal douche bag you are , david , maybe i 'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol .
no .
... i do n't think he understands ...
come on , that 's just a bullshit story . you said so yourself ...
connecticut .
i 've got to leave ?
you do n't got half what tehronne got .
okay . maybe tomorrow .
detective eckhart ! i know ! welcome to nightmute !
what a place for them ...
what 's that on your forehead , max ? that 's a nice attention getter .
what ?
i order you not to !
all right . all right .
yeah --
you mean you know about this ?
she 's got the same complaint as half the goddamn population . she ca n't get the job she 's trained for and it pisses her off ... anyway , what the fuck do you care ?
you ready ?
it 's nothing to do with money . i do n't gamble .
detective inspector ross .
she 's just outside the door .
you 're vada right ?
what can you do with four daughters , i asked myself , a string quartet was all i could come up with . they hated me for making them learn .
would you sign it for me ?
on come on , x. did you really think we were that barbaric ?
spring is here the sun will shine i 'll be his and he 'll be mine we 'll love until the end of time and we 'll never be lonely anymore
foul fellow , this couer de noir .
what gives , baxter ? you getting promoted or getting fired ?
would you like some ?
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ?
you only met him once .
i did n't like it .
that was nothing compared to this humiliation , nothing .
the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards . but , it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect : my attorney .
that 's right , sir .
it did n't happen .
things ca n't get much worse can they ?
you do n't know what i 'd do , roy . you have no idea . to live .
would you like a tour ?
look , i 'm not saying you 'd be able to do it without some hard work ...
i just told you , he 's a big , hairy ...
you said that thing was big as your hand . i do n't think i 'm going to miss ...
sure , mom . hello .
who is the boss ?
we been shoppin ' . ca n't have my boy running around lookin ' like a bum on the street .
good ? of course . are you kidding ? i 'll tell you what . buy me lunch , my friend , and i 'll tell you the best christmas story you ever heard . how 's that ? and i guarantee every word of it is true .
you want me to pick up a painting ?
cloning from what ? ! loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand !
women ? women , as lovers , are all basically the same : they just have to be there .
okay -- yeah , i can , i respect that .
you just do your job , shermin . we 'll make the policy .
about four hours .
... okay .
danny , listen up . here 's the deal ... my wife 's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab . they 're getting a very special delivery a week from this friday .
well , shit , judas , you shoulda at least gotten that --
no , captain , i tell you --
detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade ... but then again it might not . subspace weapons are unpredictable . that 's why they were banned .
no .
that feller last night , that 's who ! he was gon na stay a week , huh ? well , he 's skipped . took the car with him , too . we would n't have known a thing about it until morning if i had n't took that magnesia . come on , get up , do n't lay there . let 's do something about it .
the day care ?
no ... no ... that 's all right ... i thought i knew her ... thanks ...
fuck you .
do you have bandages ?
go to sleep now .
kryptonite !
... .hi ... ..
but ... give it us here , you dozy sod . you hide and get the guns ready . wait until they are well in , then give it to 'em .
correct ... apparently , adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the adamantium in logan 's dog tag to test it on the senator . and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan 's skeleton for a larger demonstration .
y'all never use it ?
no fighting . it was n't bob 's fault .
madame 's doctor . she has moments of melancholy . there have been some suicide attempts .
it must be something .
get us out !
i shut the meter off , for one thing . i knew i was n't going to get paid . then i dropped him off at the cop shop . they took him .
so how 's college ?
forget it . it 's in terrible taste ! i want nothing to do with this .
and what if i do n't want to give up on her ?
we 're going to find our boys ! for god 's sake sheila , you almost had them killed ! !
no , you do n't . have you learned nothing from this strike ? why are you afraid to have me at your side ? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none ?
i could n't get to her . it all happened so fast . logan had her , and i saw him fall ... then peter told me to run . and then he ... and i remember so clearly , thinking it 's me they want . if i run , maybe they 'll come after me . maybe they wo n't think about her ... so i ran ...
you win . it 's -- clarissa .
more or less .
win what ?
kip ?
he wo n't last one round .
yeah , very funny .
yeah . no , no ! no ! no , look . you do n't have to smell the world !
uh oh .
why , sure , ma'am ...
we have . in fact , we 've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i 'd really like some action from you before the end of the world .
i do n't know . i want it to be --
must be some sort of mining facility .
yes , that 's correct .
sure you do . you were thinking : 'that 's no cap gun in that kid 's overcoat . ' you were thinking 'i ca n't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again . ' you were thinking : 'i 've got to find a way to distract this kid . ' so you did . it was -- in its way -- a noble act .
may i be present ?
it was just a soldier . i was trying to punch his major in the eye .
children , i want you to be very good and very quiet while i see mrs. wheeler a moment . she 's going to take over this class for a while .
why ?
oh , i can think of a million things -
well , thank you for listening . goodbye , mr. doe . you 're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while .
upstairs . in 1963 that was the office of naval intelligence - and just by coincidence , banister , before he was fbi , was oni . what do they say ?
please come , please .
sure . i remember seeing a book about chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the white house library and the library of congress and --
so you 're from around here ?
she figured it out . i 'm sorry if that upsets you .
that means they 're unemployed .
i do n't .
sorry , ca n't do it , brah . he 's on the road . and where they 're going there 's no phones . damn , i hate this johnny , i really do . i hate violence . see , that 's why i need rosie . i could never make this thing work , myself . no way i could hold a knife to tyler 's throat , man ! she was my woman , once . we shared time in this world . but rosie , he 's kind of a ... mechanism . once you set him in motion , he wo n't stop . that 's his gift , a kind of ... blankness . noon comes , straight up , he 'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes . nothing i can do , unless i get there .
fuck you .
what exactly is it supposed to do ?
now you and david ...
poor little grusinskaya ! does it do you good to cry ? are you afraid ? shall i go ?
he wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium , is .05 parts per million . and that at the rate you mentioned , .58 , it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about . the irvings .
must 've been hard being poor .
who told you ?
it 's josh 's .
what an interface !
... sid , be reasonable - i 've been everywhere , there 's no place left to check !
i 'm relaxed -- light your cigarette .
you looking for some action ?
does n't it matter to you ?
run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .
what 's the matter ?
why do n't you take a look around the place if you want ?
yo son , check this out .
lissen . you done busted it . you hear ? but lissen here . i wo n't tell nobody , y'understan ' ?
thank you .
let me ask you a personal question , a painful one . the first of many . tell me , was your daughter the kind of girl to run around , to , ah , play practical jokes , maybe ?
yeah . do you paint ?
and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead , to take possession of elster 's wife ? ah , johnny ! come on !
what are you talking about ?
of course . yes .
well , you know i 'm standin ' here and you say i look good ?
- you could put 'em on your expense account ?
one went off , yeah , but it did n't touch him -- i thought you knew this --
you 're kidding me .
what do you do when he comes home ?
same thing , is n't it ?
keep your change . bus three-twenty-three . leaves at seven fifty two , tonight .
leave me alone . go home . go away .
what 'd you get for christmas ?
we 're movin ' . and i 'm just wondering if i should n't lighten the load right now .
i can explain .
this sexual obsession of yours . have you considered going into therapy yourself ?
they were both poisoned . i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
yeah . i know . she did that before .
funny story . you see , me and a buddy of mine decided to ... ah ... you know ... just ... drive down .
looks good to me .
what ? ?
he 's a friend . from the neighborhood . we were just talking .
nothing .
so i took his truck , yeah .
you 're going hunting ?
did you change cabs ? it did n't work , something moved there --
it was all on a russian format , i do n't think that would be so easy ; we must take that chance .
pitiful rookerful ...
murphy .
where is he ? ! !
susan , i want you to stop this . and right now !
you got the job .
booze we do n't need . why do n't you join us , baxter ? we got two brain surgeons , an ear , nose and throat specialist , a proctologist , and three nurses from bellevue .
jos ? ..
c'mon , do n't be shy . mmm , smells good . this is ya love daddy talkin ' to ya , starvin ' like marvin . say something , mookie .
oh come on , you 've talked to her . she does n't even know how babies are born , let alone made .
i guess he did n't appreciate your use of language . they do n't speak that way on television . it 's a rule . do you realize you 've cut off a valuable source of communication ?
it 's not bad .
maybe he 'll get tubed .
and then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well i just saw him . a stranger -- looking at me -- and i knew suddenly that all my life i 'd been --
looky here , you want the bitches to really fly high , make your rocks with cherry seven-up .
that you found . what do you mean you found it ?
a distinct possibility , admiral . the president did say the transmission was directed at the earth 's oceans
why not ?
he 'll need clothes ... some money ...
this doctor and wife , they 're nice people , but they do n't want to get too involved . they 're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either . you and i both know sometimes , not often , but sometimes there 's real reasons why a kid 'll run . molestation , whatever . besides that , the girl 's probably eighteen , so she 's legal .
there 's an emerald circle a few leagues from here . we 'll find her .
i do n't know !
i need you to believe in me . to believe that we can do this .
ma'am , your first impression is n't going well .
the woman 's unstable . you could wind up with a harassment charge . < u > anything < /u > . you 're like some horny little teenager .
what i been wondering is where 's he been .
you 've got to come . you 've got to give me away .
the letter from john doe .
miss daniel , be sensible , you find another place till we get things cleaned up .
answer me . was the first time you saw me the first time i saw you ? was it ? you 've been following me around . do you see how that could be disconcerting to me ? that 's not love , jerry . it 's obsession . and it is n't normal and you ca n't expect me to respond to it and you ca n't expect me to feel the same way . can you ?
how do you know it 's mine ? we only did it once .
they were ready to blame him for anything , no matter where it happened .
no thanks , honey .
roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived .
coming ...
me too ...
my ticket ?
why , you need me for the story ?
waves would be peaking really high and glassy . hit that water . ridin ' the wall just perfect .
i wondered how long it would be before we 'd get to be alone together . and i wondered if i could wait that long .
you ai n't dead .
help !
space for what ? to o.d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it is n't . correct ?
you think you was sent here cuz you 're a good cop ?
that 'd be fun for yuh . do n't you think-
i 'm so happy for you . takes the edge off , does n't it ? and where might your date be ?
we do n't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there 's a market for it .
what d'you mean ?
the police are on their way .
well , i see it still smells like pine needles in here .
neither can i .
yes you are . you always do . it 's why we broke up . you always hide behind him .
just in case ...
it 's not human , kelvin . whatever it is , it 's not human , and i am threatened by that . evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened . and i want to win . i want humans to win . so i am killing it before it kills me .
no i did n't know you had one .
what did you call me , boy ?
hey , look . ice cream .
why do n't you answer ?
he coded . they shocked him one too many times . i 'm sorry .
you 're not terribly good at taking care of h ...
mostly i remember ... the nights when we were together . i remember how you used to hold me ... and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle ... and then afterwards how we 'd watch until the sun came up . when it did , it was almost like ... like each new day was created ... only for us .
do n't fret about it , major . there 's nothing anyone can do about it now . i 'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the crm-114 .
what do you see ?
let him have his say out .
georgia , where i come from , it 's real if you make it yourself . but i been buying from the yankee government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate .
let us fill up our regimes .
well , i knew this is where my mouth would be .
you and your friend .
you mean the ones you pity .
we 're 125 million dollars in debt ?
your dance is over .
< u > ben < /u > did this ?
... so then denherder and charlie sat there trying to catch their breath , and figuring out how to explain to charlie 's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat .
i do n't like it either , but you know the rules : we get the call , we go . is the course locked in ?
yes , i 'll be there .
no ... yeah ...
that schulz pig . i 'll get him yet .
why ?
... who say ... ?
quiet . you 'll wake the men , and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives .
that 's not right yet ... put back `` president '' and take out `` dear '' ... how does it read now ?
jesus christ , what are you doing ?
speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sally 's meatloaf again , and i do n't think i could stand that .
i 'm not so sure about this . i had to go to emergency after last time ...
i 've shown it so many times i know it by heart . the first time i showed it , in 1940 , was the sunday my first wife died . they kept it hidden from me all day so they would n't have to close down the movie house . i only found out that night , after the last show . those are things you never forget ... so , toto , how are these home movies going ?
you think ... you think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what ?
yeah , are you ?
just their side . what 're we gon na do with these people ? they 're illegal aliens , the way i figure , been here forty years , you could throw the book at 'em ...
reaction to what ?
go stick your head in a tub of ice water . see where she leads .
that 's right .
how could you do that ? he 'll hurt him .
ah .
kent 's been invited to his high-school class reunion .
it 's just for a night or two , until she finds her own place . i tried to explain that to aunt ruth , but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up . i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she did n't know any ritas ...
watch . hello , bright eyes . how 's our throat today ?
we 're outta motion lotion .
sue , i need some of that anger , rage , frustration --
enzo , wake up !
jack ...
so i do it .
a computer .
god , that feels so fucking good . take yours off .
yeah , the guy owes momo a few g 's .
nothing on 'em and two cups of mud ; one while i 'm waiting .
it 's also called getting me this close to being murdered .
i guess .
why would we do that ?
sure --
what if he does n't bite ? what if he 's an exceptionally bright raccoon ?
ju-just stay away from her . it 's none of your business , okay ? there are certain things you do n't do , and you know that .
come . let 's get out of the noise . - i 'll give you a tour of the building , then we 'll talk .
that 's right , dave , i 'm headed for glenville on a whisperin ' jet .
yeah . remember quaid ?
why you say that ?
but that 's just not reality , nancy !
oh , you-you have that one ?
no . well , i do n't know . well , maybe . later .
give me the book .
dad ?
pain can be controlled . you disconnect it .
what does he look like ?
yeah ?
i . . .
okay , you got my attention , but this is cutting off the circulation to my head , here . d'you mind ?
hermaphrodites ! i rented it so we could watch it together !
ahhh ... i 'm afraid i 've got a prior commitment .
this is making me incredibly angry .
claire , i have to show up for the --
i lived here all my life , i got a million contacts , but they 're all bus boys and bellhops .
a third . i do n't think we can make a case without bud white .
yeah ?
raise away .
try an ' tell 'em , tom . they 'll get two an ' a half , jus ' the minute we 're gone . an ' you know what that is ? that 's one ton a peaches picked an ' carried for a dollar . that way you ca n't even buy food enough to keep you alive ! tell 'em to come out with us , tom ! them peaches is *ripe* . two days out an ' they 'll pay *all* of us five !
i 'm sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .
they 're everywhere . nobody 's safe . and sure as hell not in the south . they like warm weather ... you 'd never believe it . in l.a. it 's out of control . first it was drugs , now it 's witchcraft .
oh no ? i thought you was a movie star .
i 'm afraid this is no time to play cyrano , my friend . what was in your mind ?
sorry , sir . the cult is my life and my life is the cult . by god , captain god , i shall not fail you..
hey , frank .
is that what i think it is ?
oh yeah sure . why do n't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i 'm at it . i < u > know you < /u > ... this is what you do : go to the house to see her .
roger , i 'm setting up the crm-114 .
they 'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with .
me too .
well ... i misunderstood , then .
what ? yeah , sure .
you ca n't blame me for trying .
hey , i was thinking , for the dance , what about a big sign that says 'do n't tread on me ' . you know , and a picture of the earth .
enough .
what did you expect , glamor boy ? the officers ' club with a steam room and a massage maybe ?
i felt like it , so what ? goddam , you and ann make such a big deal out of it .
there is no public offering . the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo . 'wrote this just to run their web site .
how long ago ?
well , there it is , is n't it ? you do n't even like them , and you 'd sleep with them . what 's that all about ?
well , it 's probably because it would help him .
hey , listen , i love her . she 's sophia 's best friend . i never said any of this , alright . i 'll deny it on the stand ... you guys are gon na have kids . that is so great . maybe that 's what this is all about . maybe she does n't want to do this anymore . you know adults do n't do this for a living . you guys are gon na have your kids , you 'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough . sophia knew that intuitively . look at clair . clair 's a mess . make sure she gets the epidural . forget that natural childbirth shit . everything 's going to be what it 's supposed to be . `` life is but a walking shadow . a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more ... '' and speaking of me , the role of leo in your film ?
i did okay .
it 's not that - i just do n't want any sugar
not for our doctor lechter . this ... purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ... white male ... mmmm ... .mmmm ... . , after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit . left hand . it purports to be the x-ray of dr. l ...

speak it like it 's real . matthew .
and it 's good !
hey . fuck you .

it 's a living .
enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units .
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership ?
now , baby , that 's got nothin ' to do with you . i just carry that . you been listenin ' to them cops too much .

yes , mary . it 's been a long day .
i 'll get her . have a good christmas , matt ... .
black of course .
good ! do you know how we say `` make love '' ?
well just so i got a quote in my head . what 's the rate for the swede ?
it 's consider a virtue in some corners of the world .
th梩hat 's all right . if you did n't call me sourpuss , it would n't feel natural . there are snickers from the background .
you made this out of my hair ?
oh , yeah ... he had a real thick accent right outta `` deliverance . '' `` still ? who said anything about a still ? get ya ass up in them woods ! ''
i am ?
well , this might come in handy .
good evening , sir .

i know , johnny , i know ... .
pictures from the play . jamie looks pretty --
i did n't tell the others , i was afraid to ...
hey ...
... your concern nor your fight . relinquish the package and you can go .
we 've got to go on . amy , here , all this time , you 've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours . now we find you 've only kept it secret .
such a shame . you ought to take better care of yourself .
so you know your krylov in russian , do you ? mr. gardiner , i must confess i had suspected as much all along - i know an educated man when i meet one !
she has pretty red hair ... she is very kind i think .
yeah , he had a lot of problems . huh huh huh .
one way , or round trip ?
i do n't want to take any more chances .
no , admiral . i do n't think you are ; not one damned bit . i remember when you recommended me for this command . you told me how envious you were , and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again . well , sir , it looks like you found a way .
do n't fuck with us , edna ! there are at least three more limbs where that one came from !
gim me water .
why am i here ? what happened ?
are you going to turn on me too ? who helped you when you were strung out ? who gave you money ? who bailed you out of jail ?
all right .
hiya , phyllis . these are the revlon contracts . i thought you ought to check them out .
i do n't know . i do n't have it with me .
hee-hee-hee , haaaaa-that 's it ? hee-hee hee ...
ca n't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time ?
red rum .
tell me his name , dr. lecter .
i saw her in the water . beside me . she was filling the bathtub .
they 'll make you be a piece of shit again . they 'll make you be a harelip again . you better give me what i want !
... where is my pill ?
at night , there were lights -- we both saw them . we never told anyone , outside of our official report .
i know .
wait here ...
i still do n't know what you 're getting at . right now i want to take my nap . it 's important that i-
i 've often thought about going back .
you know how to fly this thing ?
he could have killed him ! okay ? he could have killed him .
well , that 's me .
maybe it 's the draft through the door .
sorry there , old spudhead .
hi .
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy . eve harrington .
my father was a pilot . and do i know how to fly ?
take her to my house . my dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone . do you have anything to put around her ?
what 'd i say again ?
sure hudson . are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo ?
you !
a passenger liner . over .
fine . hey , i 'm fine .
yes .
because they just consult their little indigenous charts .
i 'll give it a shot .
and that cici chick was n't that bad either but i 'm really concerned about my safety now .
i never read the paper .
so , are you having fun yet ?
never mind the condition of your body and your spirit ! look after your things , your things !
no thanks , i --
did i do good , mr. luthor ?
you 're lucky i do n't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself . where did you hear that story ?
how many in their party ?
it used to be the old mill .
those 80 acres , that cross the stream , what do you think of them ?
but i gave you some this morning .
yet . nothing yet .
i think its meaning is clear .
that ship saved my life a few times . it 's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy . what 's wrong with her ?
no one can see us now we 're alone .
why ?
thanks . let 's go
my name is chance .
dewey , you 're not just here because of that second rate k-mart , straight-to-video version of me , are you ?
yes , i do . i hate him and i hope he never comes back .
well , the good news is that the results are negative . i 've found no evidence in the way of lesions , hemorrhaging , tumors ...
good night , billy .
well , news of buckley ?
how long ago was it ?
you do ?
far too long .
senator 's son ?
it 's not about that job . i 'm not saying you should work for the government . but , you could do anything you want . and there are people who work their whole lives layin ' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have . what do you want to do ?
... so when your dad said , `` i never want to see your `` f-'in ' faces again ! '' do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up ?
is it necessary to know ?
-- this is n't a swap meet morrey , they 're getting sparazza and the west coast syndicate , giftwrapped , now if that 's not good enough --
spock , what is it ? do you know this vulcan ?
yeah , but you might wan na light a match before you go in there . did you bring my bag ?
the point is the killer always goes , may i speak to starsky ? he says his name .
unfortunately no , these americans are smart , they pay me only half now , half when i get them back to cairo , so i must go all the way .
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .
nowhere ? i 'm ... here .
what 's wrong with you ?
oh god , jeffrey , is that you ? oh god .
nah , i got the gun .
he 's trying to impress you .
i 'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you .
why do n't you get to it , buddy ?
fifth and mayflower . you know it ?
yep . tore him up good and spat out little , refined pieces of him . nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man .
kelly ! what are you doing here ?
why are there two ottomans ?
you do n't know anything about joe --
we get fifty percent . and we get clear of the king .
you look swell in that three梐larm number --
to help you . i 've run every test known to man . and they all yield the same result : the machine is ready .
whatever .
wise beyond her years , i 'm sure , and such poise , too . very , very impressive ...
just think ... just think . what happened to our country .. to the world ... because of that murder ... vietnam , racial conflict , breakdown of law , drugs , thought control , guilt , assassinations , secret government fear of the frontier ...
well , i better get going . hit those stairs again . was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him ?
you admit you 're lying ?
i 'm not doing too well . what 's the matter ?
maybe you should ask her some time . ever thought of that ?
no .
thanks .
pure gold it is ... plays a different note every time .
the next time you 're in wild country like this , keep in touch with the british consul .
you 're going out ?
they just sort of leave me cold .
i do n't know what came over me .
yeah . and you 're not getting anything out of it .
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane . not this lane . not today .
i must say , you look more your old self --
let 's just call it square .
leavin ' detroit . goin ' off on vacations , startin ' new lives , business trips . fun , fun , fun , fun .
... we 've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck ; got a donation from a new york dowager ... we 've even been thinking about selling t-shirts .
is there an antidote ?
ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab 3 ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott .
do n't shit where you eat .
-- those are very serious allegations , agent scully --
so ... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations .
you know your history .
really ?
what do you mean , he 's clean ?
i needed some time away .
i appreciate that . thanks a lot .
now hold on , i did n't say i did n't want to come --
where 's my brother ?
pass .
yes .
what do you mean , without him ?
i 'll be ready .
it 's not funny , doug . you dream about her every night .
san francisco .
if that 's the fact , price , okay , you 've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
saddest thing i ever heard .
you wan na see , baby ?
a foursquare , upright , downright , forthright married lady ... that 's for me . and no more make believe ! off stage or on ... remember , lloyd . i mean it , now . grown-up women only , i might even play a mother - only one child , of course , not over eight ... lloyd , will you promise not to be angry with me ?
it 's the truth .
maybe . are you ready for the next chapter ?
elaine , it 's wednesday .
honest ?
yeah i 'd say c ... c .
who ?
you 've had plenty eva , coop , it 's justin 's turn . stay on station . if anything happens ...
what did you think i would do ? jesus christ ! i gave up my life and my music ...
darling , i was busy looking out for your interests .
i did n't say anything .
you know what the bloody time is ! it 's two o'clock in the bloody morning !
it 's still an electric shock !
well ?
release the sharks ! all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads . i figure every creature deserves a warm meal .
truthfully -- you were a bit late .
cool ! we 're gon na have so much fun ! it 's like this one time , at band camp ...
keep going ...
i can only imagine . you know , i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands . i do n't think he gave it very much thought .
woah , watch it !
fine thing jim taylor wished on me -- show him the monuments -- i need this job like i need ten pounds .
you want a beer , ang ' ?
stop !
no idea -- goddamitt !
could you believe mr. blonde ?
fine . i 'll go straight .
lenny , this may be a hard concept for you , but friends do n't have to pay their friends .
oh , to hell with the diet , a number eight , please .
why do n't we go together ?
no wonder -- without your dinner .
i thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures . ned is gon na do whatever he wants to do , you know .
okay , i got ta go .
i do n't see why . i 'm twice as old as you are . how could anyone think --
still ...
what did you ... hey , where 's your spex ?
i could have lied i suppose , but i want this marriage to be legal . i just want you to know , i 'm trying to start a new life here . i 'm depending on your ...
i wear a seven .

so ? what do they think -- we 're not kids --
until it happens , you 're still a human being .
yo ho ho !

excuse me ?
a beautiful child ! is that what you still think i am ?
you 'll see her .
i 'm dreaming .
son of the american ambassador and a banker - good enough ?
that 's impossible .
by `` they '' you mean ... ?
i do n't wan na stick out my tongue .
of course not . i 'm sacking you for neglectful conduct , relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred , through your recent lack of professional judgement . a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse .
all right , i 'll develop the photos . anything i do n't want is yours .
thank you . i understand you 're an interior decorator .
undercover .
what 's weird about that ?
a blue shirt , perhaps ?
no . that was the point .
truck stop up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
you up to it now ?
`` salutations from the south ... ''
it will be fine . you have another .
hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
i get the feeling you 've done some business before .

heh heh . this is the best night of our lives .
darling , you must n't worry so .
thanks for your help .
maybe you ought to see a doctor .
yes .
okay , okay , i 'll be at the resta ...
hey jimmy , you know eddie mack , do n't you ?
hey , jack ? bullshit . i did n't make my first million until i was forty- two . forty-two . you really < u > want < /u > to change , it 's never too late .

i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword .
yes , i believe so .
my yeoman will show you to your quarters .
we keep them , in case the people come back .
i was just about to go to the door , when that man did my job for me . was it alright ?
yeah . see you in the fleet , sarge . and thank you .

but it 's what he said , just before they killed him : `` i regret that i have but one life to give to my country . ''
never mind -- i 'll pay for it now . it 'll save time .
but i do n't know how to leave lila .
anything to drink ?
so , who is he ? we have to know him .
you do n't know it was an accident . you only saw a dead man and three men carry him .
hey , put it back ! we 're takin ' off .

what 's that supposed to mean ? he was right here . he was !
sure thing , mister , it 's coming right up . 'bout an hour . quiet crossing that is .
i ca n't do that . it 's dangerous . what about my parents ? do you know where i can find them ?

you have heard your answer , monsieur le marquis .
two weeks .
sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-i'm- not-nad ' message . not after the way we broke up .
that 's impossible .
she has n't any friends left sine you started this oil business , and she never sees you .
he is real ! !
these chairs are in good condition . with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable .
right here frank . you want me to pour it ?

apocalypse , end of the world , armageddon . its always got a face and a name .

we 've got to be careful not to use our real names while we 're in here .
give me your hand and we both live .
hmm ?

to our family .
she 's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd . i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
what is this .
from me the doctor has no secrets . poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that ?
yeah . yeah , it kind of does .
i do n't know -- few hours , i guess .
how are you doing ?

popcorn ?
are you out of your fucking mind ? we 're going to die .
we 'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- there is an emotional core to each of our memories -- as we eradicate this core , it starts its degradation process -- by the time you wake up in the morning , all memories we 've targeted will have withered and disappeared . like a dream upon waking .
was i right ?
it wo n't sell .
it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .
maybe i could jump out of the window . do you think they 'd see me ?
no ! , he 's fine . fish are very resilient animals you know . do n't worry , i wo n't get another fish .
i do n't need a star . all i need is an actor -- i 'll reshoot the part , cut out nicola and replace her with a real actor . a real leading lady .
it means the nsa can read the time off your wristwatch .
the developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . we 've just slowed the process .
listen , edie , am i going to see you again ?
it happens . this is where you 'll be sleeping .
i do n't understand .
nothing , 'til i find out if it 's the gun julia wolf was killed with . keep her in here , and do n't let those reporters see her . they might believe her .
mom ? what 's wrong ?
blade . once again , our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade . he must be destroyed .
straight ahead .
no wonder he 's having so much trouble with it .
hey , cool it walter .
i do know . you focus on the big problem . but somewhere down the chain , something breaks down . something gets destroyed . at first it 's upsetting . you feel you 've lost control .
i wanted to ask you because you 're a doctor , right ?
i 'll see you ... soon .
you 've got talent , anyone could see that . and he 's the best . if he thinks a student has talent , he 'll take 'em on for next to nothing . you 're a cinch to be accepted , i could cover the cost of the lessons , like i said , it 's pretty modest --
i was n't gon na --
well , she does seem to cause a lot of trouble , i admit . but she does n't mean any harm and it 'll break the children 's hearts , they all love her .
we were never properly introduced . susan and i were fighting that day . she called him by a nickname . muns or lunts or something .
something else .

we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur . what 's her first name ?
would you check out my studio some time ?
at first , it does n't hurt at all . that 's shock . then it hurts terribly -- you would n't believe such pain could exist -- and six months later you ca n't remember what pain felt like . it has n't taken six months this time . it has n't even taken twenty- four hours . is that a beastly thing to say ?
jack ?
i had n't heard .
bree , what 's actually happened ? it was n't that bad .
i will , but jim wo n't .

boss , let 's get out of here .

it 's a character thing , bernie . i mean , you would n't do it . no offense . me neither . i mean , a guy like bubber , he 's a certain kinda guy . heroic . you and me , we 're not ... heroic . it 's not our nature . it do n't mean we 're bad or nothing . we 're just not so inclined . what about it ?
i like to wear women 's clothes : panties , brassieres , sweaters , pumps ... it 's just something i do . and i ca n't believe i 'm telling you , but i really like you , and i do n't want it getting in the way down the road .
hello ?
of course ! i promise !

it 's all about sisterhood . everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but ...
stay out of it , sefton .
i 've heard some odd things about jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself .

general schmuck ?

elliot ?
mr. clyde , do you want to know what i knew then , or do you want to know what i know now ? they 're two different things ?
you tell those guys they 'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before i 'll even say 'hi ' to them .
maybe they 're mary 's .
you take your money , too seriously , bo .
that what she was ... a norfolk deb ?
you 're out of your minds , you know that ? both of you . you do n't even know if there 's anything out there . what the hell are you thinking ?
which we could n't explore because of rocks , because of cross-winds , it 's sloppy . and here - and here - we could be staring at zerzura .
two dollars ! forget it !
oh my god , jim . jim , that was so --
do n't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out .
it 's not like he has n't made us wait a few times .
no ... how ?
do n't say that . i wanted to cut my father loose too . they told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he 's better and i go in . it 's killing me seeing him fighting like that . look , since you 're here , maybe you could do me a favor . i need you to wait for me outside this building , okay ? i have to visit a friend who 's sick .
we do not want your tired and sick .
so this is the guy you 're going to hang ?
what are you laughing at ?
good night .
almost negligible ... with variation of parameters , this is the answer .
it was n't a dream , was it . i have to go in to work and tell them whistler 's mother now looks like danny de vito .

you ol ' fucker !
tell him next time he pulls any shit , you 're gon na kick his fat ass .
first you got ta tell me something .
i 'll talk to the mayor .
the bastards outconned us .
he has to . that 's predestination . if god is omniscient , if he knows everything -- and he would n't be god if he did n't -- then he must have known , even before the creation of the world , the names of those who would be saved .
baxter , we 're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise .
karl ? did you put this in regan 's bedroom ?
do you think you 're the only one who feels anything ? is that what you think ?
johnny , this is zander .
yes , sir ! haaa !
trust me , claire . you hear something ... change the subject . you find something ... get rid of it , throw it in the lake . you know what happened . the rest is only details . and no one 's ever glad they got a hold of those . if you want to put this back together ... just let it go .
cats ? several . wal . depends what you mean by got . some are half-wild , and some are just outlaws .

sounds like you 've known a lot of lawyers .
hang on .
when do you think the phone lines 'll be back up ? i have to call my daughter , and i should call new york and let my agent know i 'm breathing .
you 're going to be late for your match .

ah ! there you are , madam . were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday ?
and then , uh , april ... huh ?
god , that 's an enormous arse .
all right then . that 's important , is n't it ? -- for you to be in an `` up '' environment . i 'm saying you should literally take that as your < u > base < /u > , do you know what i mean ? it 's something positive that you 've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon .
fascinating . what are your plans for this evening ?
well , you mentioned her father ... the divorce .
what is it ? are you ok ?
why do you show your parole officer such disrespect ? especially after i got you such a nice job .
my parents do n't read the daily news . all right , if you think i should n't . i ca n't believe the things the papers are printing . i 'm sure most of it 's not true .
it was a different time , son . and you 're a better man than that .
could i get a coke for mickey ?
he 's a riot .
but there 're so many wonderful things to write about , bob .
good .
just diggin ' . i ai n't ever gon na be happy now . not with that son of a bitch movin ' in for good . i wish me and you and mama could just run away . but she said he would find us wherever we went . he 's crazy . sometimes i think it would of been better if i wad n't ever born .
`` stop ! just stop ! that 's what you said from the beginning . if i tell what happened ... they 'll arrest you and put you in jail , so get out of here before ... ''
'continentals ' , congress ' paper money . it was worthless to start with , but as you see , counter feiters have made them even less than worthless . can you tell which one is fake ?
you ? married ?
everyone regrets something .
whatta we do about the mex ?
no , you do not .
yeah ? so , what do you want to ask today that i ca n't answer ? i 'm a busy man .

you remember opening the door ?
that 's right . i said do n't do it . did you listen to me ? no . you wanted the money . so , i lent you twenty large . now it 's been three weeks and you ai n't paid a dime . what do you think that makes me look like on the street ? i do n't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate .

i do n't know ... i 'm sorry , but dana 's a very jealous person . i just do n't want to screw that up right now ... i 'm sure she 'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends ...
i have a friend coming in from out of town , i 'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days .
then what did she do ?
what it means in england -- and in scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands . we were ambushed last night . but the scots dragged their dead away .
hard to get good help these days .
i mean it . i -- without you , i could't 've --
then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france ?
i did n't know leondegrance had a daughter .
gim me the shoe .
fine . i 'm an insensitive , chauvinist asshole , and you 're well rid of m ...
... that simpleton is holding back the race . they got rid of us and keep those two buffoons , mantan and sleep 'n eat , y'knowwhati'msayin ' ?
for that old possession charge ? gim me a break .
so we just go eat with him and that 's gon na solve everything ?
no . galatians 15:2 ? galatians has only six chapters . the same with jonah 6:8 -- jonah has four chapters . lecktor was n't using a bible .
missiles ! sixty miles off , heading in fast . steady track , they look like beam riders .
pops put big daddy 's farm in rhonda 's and sunny 's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it .

oh , buddy-boy . i was just about to call you . i 'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall . you see , my little friend , she kept insisting picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but i 'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil .

we know these people ... !
do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed ?
uh-huh .
you watch me , do n't you ?
um , i 'm not touching anything .
you need to fill out those forms . application , psych-tests : m.m.p.i . and t.a.t . for the financial questionnaire , do n't answer anything you do n't feel like . we 'll run a t.r.w ... .
you got fired from pushing a broom , you little bitch .

theo , buzz is dead .
shut up ! are you serious ? of course i will ... of course .
the tv did n't work .
as you know ratings have never been our primary goal . i imagine we 'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing truman 's latest torment . however , i 'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal .
i know we cousins and all , but do n't try an ' hook me up with the big little sisters .
i think testicular cancer should be no contest .

he used to love losers . but the laws of physics changed .
we were ?
no i 'm not ! i 'm talking about common , everyday life here . if you let yourself worry about one thing , you 'll worry about the next , and the next , and it never ends . in this place , ignorance is n't just bliss , it 's a matter of survival .
not unless you hear my confession .
so it is going to happen after all .

i did n't trust her . all that blood on the sheets . she may look sweet , but she could be a wolf in sheep 's clothing . something 's weird .
kate , give your old man a little credit . every person who chooses the service of god as their life 's work has something in common . i do n't care if you 're a preacher , a priest , a nun , a rabbi or a buddhist monk . many , many times during your life you 'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself , am i a fool ? we 've all done it . i 'm not going through a lapse . what i 've experienced is closer to awakening . i 'm not trying to shake your faith . i 've just decided not to devote my life to god anymore .
you have such a pretty , long neck , like a swan .

if this is a joke , it 's not funny .
i do n't agree with you .
but if all i can give 'em is ordell 's name -- i do n't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- that do n't give me much to bargain with .
three men were ambushed and shot , two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake , the other has severe hypothermia , possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week 's end ... if he even lives that long .

coward . giving up .

we 'll have to take it easy then . i do n't think we 'll find much aboard the ship , but it 's probably worth looking around .
you 've got everything planned .
why do n't you go to bed -- son .
why were you snooping in my office ?
i told her it 's just business to you , that all you want is a reasonable solution to this . you give her daughter back , she agrees to leave the country . i play the guarantor , drive her down to mexico tonight , and put her on a train to brazil or wherever .
i do n't think i could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer .

new wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia . 19th century , i think : what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane . the vannacutt version was : bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce , it 'd traumatize 'em back to `` normalcy .

analyzing signal polarization shifts .

gwen , my wife 's dead .
fine ! eat in the cupboard .
touche .

you 're thinking ... ?
at least masseria plays by the rules . maranzano thinks he 's god , and the rules do n't apply .
i know .
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i 'd forged .
alright , well ... you 've got to tone it down . you do n't need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic .
i got what i fucking deserved . i had it all . i could 've kept going !

a lifelong problem , i 'm afraid .
which they do . and we 're standing there . all the football guys are in the lobby , watching , there 's even an espn crew . so i turn to her and sort of grandly say , `` well , this is me , klutz , asking you , goddess of rock climbing , to marry me . '' and i took out the ring , and i do n't much like big scenes , but she said `` yes '' right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies . we 're getting married in february .
yes .

dunwitty wants a coon show . and that 's what i 'm going to give him , it 's going to be so racist , so negative , he wo n't have the balls to put it on the air . hence i 'll prove my point .
would you ? because if you could n't , i would be very lonely ... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen . but none of this will happen . so it does n't matter . because we are on the guajira peninsula . and all you see around you ... look around ... is archangel de jesus montoya- londono . he is my man . and you are a smuggler moving a load ...
i never thought you were .
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water ?
shooting at maybe eight feet . i ca n't use any lights .
so we 're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they 've already bought ?
what happens if i say no ?
oh , i am , baby , believe me .
i should have known ... once i would have ... i used to be wary ... and today i watched my son killed before my eyes ... your sister civilized me and i damn myself for having let her ...
i 'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours . we are but eightscore young blondes , all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half , cut off in this castle , with no one to protect us . oooh . it is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear ... .
then , after that , what ? joe 'little knife ' pisani ; willie bufalino , maybe , mr. maranzalla himself , c'mon !
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle . he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble . his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing . and he could n't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still could n't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver . i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . splat ! it just stuck up there and spread out . it was about the size of a half dollar . and that 's why i do n't ever eat fish eyes .
test the product ?

well , bruce , here you are -- certified and everything .
you know something ?
my hair 's kind of a mess , is n't it ?
the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench .
ellie ... we both know that if i was any kind of a man , i never would 've entered this race . that i would have told the president straight out : helen , eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass ... but she 's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together . that more then anyone else on the planet , she 's earned this . and that she should be the one to go because she 's the best we have . but that 's not who i am . i like to think it 's who i might 've been if things had gone a different way ; that i might have been worthy , really worthy of what i 've been given ... you do what you have to do . and in the end , as with everything , it comes down to power . and it is n't fair ...
i ai n't interested in his mental condition . all i want to know is , is he d 'n d or is he a canary ?
keep away the cats ! thou art like one of these fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says , & quot ; god send me no need of thee. & quot ; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
that means it was a success . i woke up the audience -- like punk rock ! here , take this .
i do n't know .
without me . i 'm afraid . i got the axe this morning .
i was working ... ca n't you just drop me a thank-you note ?
i 'm not saying you 're wrong , just that there are other possibilities ... .
yes , that 's it . sweet name , is n't it ? foreign . but sweet .
technically . they 're separated .
there 's always another girl .

i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning .
i 'd hate to get *trapped* in here .
do i want you ?
lookit her bounce .
he 's at home . listen , i ca n't believe he went to the store . i 'm mortified , actually . i 'm really sorry . he had no right to do that , and i told him so .
... but i bet the story she < u > did n't < /u > tell you was the best story of all . how old crazy jake < u > was really her papa < /u > . and she < u > liked < /u > fucking papa ! and now she 's killed the sonufabitch ! just like she 's gon na kill you !
that 's why i 'm quitting . i want to go some place where i can be a woman .
do try to sleep , bob .
that 's always been my problem .
you sure you wan na start off that big ? bet like that could put a real dent in us .
wait . i want to listen .
how ?
huntley told me today that if i come through on the benton deposition , they may consider me for senior associate .
dick , do n't push me right now .
always did . i think she favored him a little . you tend to when you have more than one , even though you love 'em all the same .
oh no -- _ 14 .
but this is so humiliating .
-- and you told me that . still , there 's some kind of imagery that 's haunting you and , i think , getting in your way --
i forgot my vacuum cleaner .
and now ... the guitars are out of tune , and the words do n't make sense , and somebody unplugged the mike ...
the witness is excused ; take him out .
yeah . at night .
it 's a lovely garden .
how could he have left without his keys ?
elvis is still in there ! it 's gon na go off !
snoop onto them ...
yeah . figured you could have it .
just a favor for your old man .

i 'm dreaming this . shit , this is a dream .
penitent . penitent ...
i 'm cool , baby . they 're gon na give daddy a room , some breakfast , maybe bennett 's singing .
... frozen ! so if you do n't mind -- !
parrots can do as much , mr. treves . it 's all very nice , but i do n't see the point . you know they wo n't let him stay here .
no . her case is too advanced . but maybe , someday , with more research-
it 's one thing to want somebody out of your life . it 's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of drano .
here ... all the seaweed you want . now , what ?
and your father was executed .
is there any chance of them surviving out there ?
this here 's the desert an ' we 're right in it !

it 's like war of the worlds .
gear ?
allie reynolds . he 's my boy .

now just a minute-
will you leave me alone ... ?
zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains . they 'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses .
thank you .
well , i 'm off to a pretty good start .
look ... would it be possible to make the `` ghoul 's wife '' a little less prominent , so people wo n't really notice me in the movie ?
what 's wrong with walter , dude ?
that 's right .
kissed a lotta tadpoles . listen , i been thinking about your problem . i 'm not the guy to sponsor you . it would be unethical . but , there is something i could do for you . putt-putt golf .
i 've heard this one as well . two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france . but only one of them made it . and before dying of extreme old age , he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a franciscan friar , i think .
do you hear buzzing fish ?
i remember her ! she was a bit player in a couple of my movies . a nobody ! so what does it matter ?
get lost .
you 're coming back ?
not < u > any < /u > car . i like to keep a variety . i 'm always looking for the new experience , like this one . i liked it .
that 's okay . i wanted to talk to you .
why -- why -- of course .
if he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus lenore here .
but we need a creative dissent . our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus , but the differences are differences of emphasis , not of fundamentals . now , the new alignment 's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements , rather than march along in parallel line that never converge . tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly , we will gain a new unity .
but there 's another one still to come - the dramatic notice .
humor me , sid .
we do n't need a name . we 'll cast an unknown .
you know -- mrs. diz moore .
if it was left up to me , i would poison him .
but you did promise .
you know you 've been nothing but trouble since i hooked up with you -- but i have to admit i 'd miss you if i lost you ...

it did , but it never paid off -- until now . i ought to be back within an hour . we ca n't leave until near dark anyway .
hmm ?
you make me laugh much more than ray does , if that 's what you 're getting at . but i already knew you could make me laugh . it 's everything else i do n't know about .
will you just relax , mon ? he 's not gon na kill us . my father is a television repairman . he 's got all kinds of tools . i can fix-this car .
you know how it is , dad . he 's sort of under mother 's thumb .

there 's only you , ryan . you know what , ryan ? you 're beautiful . i love you so much ... you need ...

well ? why are n't you there right now ?
so do i .
she took care of the dealers ...
what is she doing ? okay , 20 % .
jill says nothing .
i think it 's time we got one thing perfectly clear , willa . marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of heaven .
prove it . if we ca n't get back , it 's still just a theory .
people who will help our cause .
well , like kill him with the atomic bomb ?
is n't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle ?
you do a lot of real estate trading , brandon ?
two sides ? you 're dr. jeckle and mr. jackass .
with an iron penis three feet long . load it , boy .
do n't bother to grow up . it 's no fun at all .

i just called downtown , and it 's on their desk .
jordan . might we do this over lunch tomorrow ? i do very much want to talk , but now is scarcely --

it 's because there 's nothing to be afraid of anymore . the world 's about to end . i feel like i could save it .
that 's what it cost , david .
do n't you want to see what daddy does for a living ?
i looked for you in my closet tonight . it 's crazy , i do n't know where you came from but . i like you .
let 's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose .
lotte called me .
what makes you say that ?
i do n't know how .
you sonofabitch .
and you were such an apt pupil ! what fun you two must have had , playing games with me ! why me ? why did he pick on me ? ! !
have you thought about a wife ? a family ?
... it 's five of , you 'd best get on in there .
the test is n't one hundred percent accurate . you should ...
time 's up . thank you for the interview .
i think it 's safe to get out now .
let me see !
it 's where situations like these lead , claudia , unless you do something about it early , if and when the police call and come for help . now there are certain measures you can take --
canyon ahead . i circled once to buy some time to think .
no .
it 's all my fault . i 'm the servant ... it 's my mission ! here !
go ahead .
all they got is advertisements . just like l.a .
no .
sam , what are we going to do with you ? can you hear me , sam ?
what do you mean , it 's 'gone ' ? where has it gone , tommy ?
but genesis is a civilian project , under my control --
now that you 're born again , what do you wan na do ? statue of liberty ? entertain some ladies ? miss saigon tix ? seduce some women ? play nintendo ? bone some chicks ?
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up , and walked along the corridor , and the streets and the backyard ?
i threw out the stuff that got broken . the floor looks clean .

i wish i could , rebecca , but i ca n't let you .
i think so . i 'm not sure ... are you ?
we 're just going to refresh your memory ...
you do n't happen to have a cigar , do you ? i 've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he has n't got one - who thinks i 'm going to stop smoking ... i changed the subject , did n't i ? dear , dear ! what a disagreeable old man i 've become . you want to know what i think of charlie kane ? well - i suppose he has some private sort of greatness . but he kept it to himself . he never - gave himself away - he never gave anything away . he just - left you a tip . he had a generous mind . i do n't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions . that was because he had the power to express them , and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - but he did n't believe in anything except charlie kane . he never had a conviction in his life . i guess he died without one - that must have been pretty unpleasant . of course , a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death . but we do know what we 're leaving ... we believe in something . you 're absolutely sure you have n't got a cigar ?
these murders are his masterwork . his sermon to all of us . to all us sinners .
congratulations .
pardon me , but why must i do you a favor ?
detroit , you must be pretty busy .
the roman empire ... when a plot against the emperor failed , the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes .
to tell you the truth , i am frightened too . shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall i carry on the best i can ?

let 's see it .
oh romance is not a children 's game ...
movies ?
i had him !
and if they don't. ? what will happen to spock ?
... no , i 've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain . maybe it 's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one 's fellow man ? to help somehow to ease his suffering . maybe it 's a personal pain . at any rate , i do n't believe good work is possible without it .
have a good trip .

it 's a potent aphrodisiac , is n't it ? power over another man .

that 's really cool .
boy or girl ?

i think you gave me too much time , captain .
dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom . it was made by your ass . you 've been dragging it all fucking week . what happened to you yesterday ?
well , some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin , and this kind of car sounded `` hollow '' ..
i received this information from an alien . i was at the paramus holiday inn , i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking . then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that 's where he told me about the end of the world .
what ?
here , get down .
what am i , an ass ? when you called me , i called elkins , and her bosses . nothing she saw is proof of anything .
one seventy-nine .
julie grant is a behaviouralist . she 's not medical . she has n't been as ... exposed to ... to things ... as some of the rest of us . she 'll be alright . i 'll talk to her . she 'll be alright .
you mean like pedal pushers ?
everything抯 under control up here . are you ready ?

two miles .
she has the power of vision .

come on , boy , come on , darlin ' . you kin do her . just let that ol ' belly sag and enjoy itself . stay loose , buddy . eight more , between you and everlasting glory . little ol ' eggs , pigeon eggs , that 's all , fish eggs practically .

good . i fucking hate australians .
thank you very much , hal .
these roads can be very treacherous at night , especially in a maniacal toon vehicle .
except for the part about my setting up a company in zurich and knowing anyone named sam vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the gambino family .
i 'll change back before we leave .
come on . you do n't think that after they called the cops on me , her and mohammed had a nice laugh ?

what you doing to my nephew ?
your offense ? why are you here ?

bret ... what the fuck ... ?

absolutely not . i am very sorry , but no .
`` of the silvery moon ,
you know knowlton pretty well ?
what 's the point ?
kenny 's aunt ?

that 's not your tape .
you want to go back to kill , is that it ? ! now , you 'll want to kill your own ! ! ! kill sandmen ! ! ! killing 's all you ever ... ! ! !
i guess not ...
your son .

there 's a jesse on the phone .

you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness ?
i 'm afraid i 'm a little rusty yet .
besides , dad would have freaked .
who is it ?
what if i reached a point where you did n't think i was crazy anymore ? if i was normal .
realize ?
and how many soldiers do you have ?
wheelchair accessible .
well ... you see , when i broke it off with phyllis , she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she 's been harboring ...
and of course to you , my sweet , for your ... moral support .
know what this is ?
gary .
it is possible ... and i know this is n't something you want to hear . your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it , but where she knew your husband would never find it . she might have wanted to tell you something ...
ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the london times . what 's that about ?
and it better bloody not be . once he is firmly in place , he gets the rest of us in . we 'll get nasty with a couple of them , shit 'em up , scare and gag 'em . i ca n't see these wankers giving us a problem , but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy . when the job is done we 'll come straight back here . it 's dark by then , unload and robert 's your father 's brother . everybody savvy ?
yeah but , no offense , you 're talking about a post-high school , long- distance relationship , and you and kevin have n't even done it yet .
it 'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this , inspector --
i have this concept for a tv pilot . there 's no guarantee it will get made but regardless , you 'll still make some money .
of course -- my god , you think something this big just happens ? the break-in and the cover up , of course mitchell knew , but no more than ehrlichman .
to ski ?
he was n't . i can feel it .
i 'm cool . i 'm cool .
not yet .
well --
in a bit .
no promises , mr. scott . on your way .
we 've never meant to be treasonable , sir . but up there , in the face of that cliff , is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts .
aitz chaim he , dude . as the ex used to say .
the boat blew . there was a leak in the gas line . there were two previous repairs . there was a five-mil policy on both of 'em . a real heavy investigation . zilch . goose-egg . it was an accident .
he 'll be so relieved .
maybe yes . maybe no .
you do n't count .
jeanne , be patient .
i also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with --
ambassador , i -- i had no idea you were here ... i think you know my crew ...

hey , anything for a friend . how 's the knee ?
we 'll vacuum these streets if we have to .
are you sad , bill ?
how is my dear friend benjamin feeling ?
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , arnie .
so did i .
and what will we do when we get there ? i 'm sixty-five years old , ray . so are you . what are we gon na do out here ? get married , have kids , settle down ? that boat sailed without us , man .
and what was the trip < u > before < /u > ... ?
just for fun , i guess .
let 's get the hell outta this crazy city .
i know a lot more than that
by the time i 'm at the belt , you phone and say , `` how are you ? '' forty-five minutes later i reply , `` not bad . how are you ? ''
jesus christ , we 're only going nine miles . be there in two hours , tops !
morning . did you sleep ?
it was never easy , but before jurassic park , you could find money . somewhere . now fossils are out . everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur .
i do n't know . look , man , if you 're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops .
you saw that ?
yeah . ah ... yellow , let 's paint it yellow .
everything in order , sir ? what are < u > you < /u > doing here , my lad ?
over this ?
... sod you , stupid twit .
this is too painful to look at .
yes . it is today .
now strip .
oh ellie . it 's so beautiful . it 's the most beautiful thing i ever saw .
i 'm not pushing you around ! i 'm asking you questions .
you know how often these pourers get hit on ? i 'm going for a swim . get the blood flowing . want to come ?
look at `` blood , sweat , and canvas '' . these are big movies , fink . about big men , in tights ? both physically and mentally . but especially physically . we do n't put wallace beery in some fruity movie about suffering ? i thought we were together on that .
are you comfortable ? do you ... want to move to the bedroom ?
leave him alone , tim .
i did n't say you were scared .
i do n't know ...
so , she did n't leave a note ? she never gave any indication where she might go , before she left ?
hey , he 's not sore , is he ?
why this tree ?
no , thank you . i do n't think i should stay very long .
summer colds are the worst .
how does winston find him if a.t.f . and all the local police ca n't ?
i 'll get it because i 'm a good actress , richard .
call up petrov and order stravanavitch ' s release .
huh ? oh , come on , sis . i 'm tellin ' ya , we ca n't play clue with just two people .
i wan na go home now .
i 'm a professional killer .
put that thing away or you 're going to get us all killed .
waldos .
it should take me twenty minutes . where are you coming from ?
i 'd like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt .
did i miss something ?
i 'll never get it polished in time . give me a buckle , zack .
here . got pictures .
we offer ...
four hundred and fifty dollars . is it a deal ?
out !
that 's how it 's done . you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own .
i 'll be down in a jiffy .
he does n't like you . thank you for answering my question .
i sometimes feel things 've gone downhill since john kennedy was killed , senator .
i would n't know .
evan treborn .
what would n't last ? what 's the matter with you ?
go on .
i taught kindergarten .
you ca n't < u > do < /u > that , i wo n't < u > let < /u > you !
donnie ?
do more . otherwise , i 'll be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum .
he ca n't manifest .
i 'm not sure it 's possible .
is that in my chart ?
what do i want ?
not you . i want ricky to answer .
nothing . she wanted to know about suck night .
which country ?
no . i 'm a gardener .
fine . could you please see that she gets this .
thomas franklin , an attorney .
ai n't we good-timing here ... ?
and every day i gave him a quarter . every day . then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks . and when i went back there , you know what he said ?
no , c'mon --
she just needs time to cool off i 'll give it a day .
yeah ?
fine -- maybe i 'll see you there sometime .
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia ?
listen , i 've got a dinner -- ca n't we do this tomorrow ?
you knit ?
do n't you even miss me ? did n't i mean anything to you ?
so what is they have enough to shut us down !
look pal , i 'm just askin ' how you ...
he 's running the show .
you 're standing on my h.q. , lieutenant !
weird . why do n't i slip into something comfortable ?
you what ?
is it the one you wanted ?
okay ?
hey .
frank . he did n't mean it . leave him alone . come on . he did n't mean it .
yeah -- we met him . wonderful boy ... close personal friend of george 's here .
sir , it 's very possible this asteroid is not stable .
melanie ...
put those away . we ca n't have marks on his wrists .
where the hell do you come off hitting women ?
maybe . maybe not .
there 's ... there 's no need to bring anything dressy ... or ... i mean -- i did n't know if we 'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes .
ca n't do it . there 're telegraph inspectors all over the place . i got 750 grand coming in from the coast , and i 'm not gon na blow it for a lousy 14 gees . we 'll get somebody else to do our betting .
for example ?
it 's just ... i leave behind friends , family , a coupla good job offers in chicago and in three dizzying weeks i 've helped acquit a coke dealer , a speed dealer --
she took the night off . heavy date . some guy she 's had her eye on for a while .
not at all .
what did you tell them ?
that 's alright , man . it 's a little early for me to drink .
imagine , for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower .
say it and you 'll believe it . life is good . say it .
no , we did n't .
i wish i could , paul . try to hold out .
you get not to go to jail .
yes . she 's helped me understand homicidal impulse .
how 'd the camera get so high like that ?
it could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future , theoretically , it could happen at the moment of your birth ... or conception . actually , it could happen at any time . it 's a question to which i hope we 'll never learn the answer .
wonderful . there 's some light from somewhere ...
look , bob !
you were eavesdropping .
i got your check in the mall .
i 've never dealt with death before . i was n't alive when my grandparents died . i wish i could know . i mean , all this ... could just be in our heads . now it feels like it 's everywhere .
what did he want ?
her eyes were turgid with fear , but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level .
you 're sweet .
peter ... peter kelson .
climb down off your cross . they already knew about her . she was subpoenaed six months ago ! who the hell do you think named you ?
yeah . you know , piano bars . plays the piano and sings . that 's how they met .
but what if he escapes ? why do n't you just shoot him ? what are you waiting for ?
lem me get this straight , you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ?
i do n't do groups .
hello , i think ... i could be mistaken . they 're using a very primitive dialect . but i do believe they think i am some sort of god .
my name 's dorota , i 'm jurek 's sister . oh ! you 're bleeding .
y'want to gim me brigham 's pistol ?
no ?
buddy ...
all right , mark mottola up a little and put him on a bus . nothin ' fancy , just enough to keep him from coming back . get some local people to take care of the other two . we got ta discourage this kinda thing .
quiet , max . what do you think , this is a conversation ?
i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is .
and bourne ? where 's he now ?
yeah ? i ran it for lots of platforms , ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
chargeures , property and casualty insurance . we are preparing a report .
what about the money ? uh , where 's the box ?
of joanne 's ?
no ?
mr. nygma , you 'll forgive me for being rude . but what exactly is on your mind ?
i am the muffin .
we are passing through the bassen rift . the projections will return when we have cleared it .
no , i do n't think that 's very much fun . let 's play house instead . you be the friend who comes to see me . i 'll show you my children .
this is a convent , not a clinic . we offer moral guidance , not hardware .
bullshit it 's cosmetic ! my fucking tooth was cracked in half . i made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity . the department 's dental is for shit .
the chinese .
came over the satellite . we 're keeping the bird clear should they call back .
yeah , like people in love .
but that was n't so long ago . it could n't have been more than ...
i do n't know .
there .
actually , i was just looking for a restroom .
yes .
... what ? what did you call me ? george ... mccord . you 're my favorite actor on ...
no . it 's new and clean , and waiting .
what about me ?
you do ... ?
no . i 'm okay .
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you .
kelly , i want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows .
ask her if she knows how i might reach him ? if she has a telephone number ?
mmmnkay .
alright , let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second . is this the best thing to do ?
the person who put us in touch seems to think so .
who ?
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships . but it does n't get us any closer to removing those missiles .
let 's hear it .
you get out of here ! if any of you men think you can come busting in here-
no , that should be more than --
what kind of concerns ?
i 'd rather not .
yes , exactly , but his first , his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening .
there are things i have to tell you , about how we met , and why we are together . but they can wait . the only important thing now is that i love you and i 'm going to keep you safe .
except , you 're willing commit murder with them .
just loud enough to wake me up .
gaahhd ! what a < u > cop < /u > ! you busted me ! the new one , in the marina . she has a police radio scanner . it 's always on . she turns it off , and then she has to turn it on again . she 's obsessed . she ca n't not listen to it , but she ca n't listen to it , so she makes me listen to it .
home , boys . back to our farms .
or the living fall in . who knows .
do what ?
martin , uh , we 've found it .
did n't think you would . i 'm going to go make the coffin .
groovy . young master of the revels , a treat for our hostess ?
i ca n't feel her bones . she 's like a sponge .
forget i said wife .
bullshit ? i 'll give you bullshit -- there 's a dead whale out there with bites all over it !
i did n't beat it ; i hid from it . if you were smart you 'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog , because what little life you have left is over as you know it . do n't make new friends , do n't fall in love , and do n't ever bother trying to save others . that 's the worst killer of them all .
why not ?
elitism ?
we do n't operate like you kgb boys .
but i did n't sell cigarettes to any kid !
it 's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge . jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch 's mind .
yes , i just found it on the step .
jesus . the whole damn thing 's loaded .
pray they do n't turn out to be nightmares .
or what ? you 'll have me fired ?
we 'll figure something out .
i 'm thinking ...
it 's christmas eve , fran -- let 's not fight .
forget her sister , then .
nilsen .
not exactly , but i want to be one , like you .
the jews are n't the middle , henry . they 're the far left .
seven years ago i interviewed a guy . he said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords . one cut off the others head . he shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him .
hurling --
is n't that what they always say ?
been here long ?
i know it well .
who 's chest ?
you 've always had good taste in husbands , so ...
well , the name zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 b.c . by the ... what 's that say ?
call me willie . i ai n't got nuthin ' but time , mr. garrison . minutes , hours , days , years of'em . time just stands still here like a snake sunnin ' itself in the road ...
'from the desk of waring hudsucker . to . sidney j. mussburger . regarding . my demise . dear sid . by the time you read this , i will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning . i will retain fond memories of the many years you and i -- '
you are well ?
do you have to wear that hat ?
what ?
well , now you know ... the enemy is on the move . we have n't much time .
they 're ready now .
how about some evening clothes ?
oh-h-h ... was she hurt ?
you mean my championship trophy ? my bad .
oh , i 'm so happy you said that because i wanted to show you my paintings . this is the `` rape of rome '' and , of course , there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of leda and the swan .
we know now that we ca n't beat their machines -- but we can beat them ! they are mortal beings ... the only question is whether we have time enough to do anything !
you know what , i can play baseball with my brothers when i 'm bigger .
she what ?
this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade .
what ?
no .
goodnight .
the plot thickens . it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher .
i want to fly jets , sir !
jimmy , would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die ?
pull them out .
he 's right . our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies ...
roger . one-three-eight .
slow it down , slow it down , whatever it is , we 'll figure it out .
the minute i read that script i said ...
ah , ca n't stay away from her , can you ? like a moth to a flame .
please .
i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector .
wait here . do n't move .
i 've heard you call him freddy .
come here a minute .
i 'm married , george . me . i ca n't believe it . can you believe i 'm married , george ?
but that 's not the point ...
scotty , how long is this bay ?
hey .
it does n't seem right .
we must sound the retreat !
what if it was ?
give 'em a box of macanudos .
ow ! i 'll kick your butt !
and who are you to talk ? you were nothing . you could n't even sing . i must have been out of my mind .
this is your dream , reed . you should be the one up there .
i 'm going to squeeze you , corleone , because i do n't like you ; i do n't like the kind of man you are . i despise your masquerade , and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family .
i thought you did n't believe in miracles today mother ?
liar . did you come from the city on the left , or the city on the right ?
yes , i did .
who gives a shit ? i 've had it up to here with arrogant frenchmen .
what did you say ?
i 'm coming over to your side , that 's what . and i have a feeling i 'm making a big mistake .
i 'm just saying , there 's wickedness in you ... i can tell from your snores .
what about keith ?
is that what you came here to say ?
he doesn1t have fungus , does he ?
my goodness , a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
i think by twenty-two .
you know what ? i抦 not having this conversation right now .
going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on .
i ca n't .
beats me .
he 'll be looking for another apprentice .
i do n't think we can treat this as a formality . mr. kennedy made a verbal promise to the russians not to invade cuba . but you authorized dr. kissinger to put this in writing .
just do n't believe everything you see .
scout 's honor .
shhhh ... it 's all right ... also , i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed .
no . you 're dead , son - get yourself buried !
yeah , i guess there 's nothing like watching those tenpins fall , huh , del ?
put your back to the railing . sit up on it .
argyle . i 'm your limo driver . hey , nice bag .
happy birthday .
we run a pretty tight ship here .
madmartigan ! i ca n't stand being in closed-in places .
if i only knew how ...
i 'm taking off my mike .
here . what do i do next ?
like what ?
beats king up .
i 'm ... i 'm just delivering a package .
no doctors ? that 's fine . that 's just fine .
regards to her majesty .
on that i choose to remain dubious . two are dead now in two nights .
i wo n't lose you .
i confuse melancholy and depression sometimes ... .
that 's him when he was twelve , back in 1919. something happens here you 'll have to remember later on .
no . i 'm good .
great . donovan actually said the words `` good work , ms. woods '' . he takes me seriously ! can you believe it ?
thanks .
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs. leeds and i 'll tell you if you 're right or not .
goodbye ...
what if i chant ?
what , what , what is it ? !
actually , i think i prefer katherine hepburn .
not yet . do n't say anything yet . okay ?
okay .
yes . now about our date for tonight ...
... one day he 'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they wo n't know what to make of him . the thick brow , so lacking in imagination . the dim little eyes , devoid of curiosity .
i 'm going to miss old annie . pop , i think i 'll get dressed and go over to harry 's party .
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel .
yeah , he 's aces . thanks , turk !
let me rephrase . were you attracted to him ?
damn .
oh , i do n't care , i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and it 's pissing me off .
are you still in love with alan ?
if she was sitting here , then it 's facing the wrong way . what are these smears in the blood ?
we were just riding around .
he 's not here ?
they 're supposed to hold short-arm inspection .
something came up .
that was big of him .
-- no .
i do n't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life .
shep did n't tell us much , jerry .
you did say birds ?
will you get out of here . will you get out of here . will you . i 'm trying to run an office here . will you go to lunch ? go to lunch . will you go to lunch ?
i bought you a four-six exacta box . you owe me twenty bucks .

vomit ?
i got a single room .
it 's john bonham 's birthday .
-- harry , were n't you just arguing the opposite way ? --
well , like i said , ann is my sister . sisters talk . you can imagine the rest .
oh , no , no , no .
well , i 'm here now . i 'd like to do something ...
industrial refuse .

come gentle night . come loving black-browned night give me my romeo . and when i shall die , take him and cut him out into little stars , and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun . o , i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed , and though i am sold , not yet enjoyed . o , tedious is this day , as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .
i 'm not asking you to believe me . you 'll see for yourself ... and so will your crew . you 're all coming with me .
i can imagine ... you know , all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you wo n't want it yourself ?
why should i believe a man who never believed me ? they 're absolutely right , you know -- guilt should never be doubted . it 's easier that way .
it was the ship 's maiden voyage , to test the drive . the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters . they received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive . and the ship vanished from all our scopes . no radar contact , no enhanced optical , no radio contact of any kind . they disappeared without a trace . until now .
nothing , this was my last delivery .
who 's staring ?
there 's something out there for me , dad . something different . something free form , you know ? something for me , and college just is n't it .

no more stalemate tom , we got the soldiers , we 'll match them gun for gun if that 's how they want it . they know me for what i am , tom -- and they 're scared of me .
what do you want from me ?
do you think anything between us could be impersonal ? or pure ? you better forget logic , because you 're proving why i should n't go to bed with you .
anyway , big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands . 'who can play baseball ? ' and there was a little voice that yelled out , 'me , i can play . ' everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove .

hello ... no . he 's not here . i have n't seen him all night ... i do n't know when ... what ? tell him what ? vietnam ? ... what experiments ?

do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
that cut you got ?
it could n't have gone better . it 's practically set . of course , he has to finish this picture first , but mine will be his next .
i 'm a good boy , but no one listens to what i say .
do n't patronize me ! you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and did n't warn me !
a camp ! well !
i have to talk to you .

build for him a pyre . light up the sky with his passing .
holy shit . that girl ?
what about that d.b . cooper guy ?
i was wrong ! that 's the whole point ! sammy 's wife came to me and -
i found him .
she fucked me .
what for ?
you must take the oath ! not even a king , would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith .
sure .
are you kidding ? he might as well say , `` can i date rape you ? ''
jazz , we 're talking here .
this is quite a pad you got here , man . completely unspoiled .
and terror , if you do n't mind .
and die !
oh , yes .

let 's all have a drink .
the attacks are unceasing : by night , the dark ones ; by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers .

uh - will that hold you , joe ?
i knew that loose was too noose ! i mean , noose too loose ! goddamn you !
i will ...
... i do n't understand it . all i can think is that maybe because the video gear was n't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design .
in time i 'm sure it will all come back to you .

it was good . he was a hard worker , a lot of drive , a real hustler .
i know your height , your weight and your social security number -- you had mumps , you had measles , and you had your appendix out .
nice ! most of california would have been destroyed . millions of people would 've been killed ! the west coast as we know it would have --

you guessed it . the card 's phony . i got plenty of 'em . different names , different jobs . i work out of san francisco . go anywhere , do anything . all it takes is the folding .
dr. nebbleman , i want to know the moment the nanobot arrives . the instant , understand ?
the uzi 9 millimeter .
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon , down on montgomery street .
do you know where you 're going ?
you heard about julia wolf ?
he says you are very sad ridiculous man . i do n't agree of course . and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute . nadia is a prostitute . i 'm sorry .
do n't push it . you better watch your ass with these fed types . if there 's a screw-up , they wo n't think twice about burnin ' it .

yes --
we nev -- we do n't name names ! we say the pope .
but the police --
i do n't care .
what 's all this for ?
i 'm serious .
albert 's got the stomach flu .

but -- who are you -- what d'you do here ?
what did tommy say ?
you think golden boy can handle it , cap ?
face it , you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you 've got to find somebody . face it , time is n't on your side .
it 's been a good two years , victor ... the company 's accomplished so much .

i抳e had a long and unpleasant day . i抦 tired and i抦 angry . but mad ? not yet . i paid leon抯 boy a visit this morning . found him alive and well . why haven抰 you told your husband where he is since reading my note , eh ?
would you , shush ? ! these phones are n't secure !
serious as a heart attack my friend . i think she literally fucked me brains out .
no , ma'am . no way . there 's girls on the rubber rose who are political , but i do n't share their views . i got no cowgirl ideology to expound . `` politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it . ''
father , i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends . so thanks for the offer.. but no thanks .

you 're amazing , jehuda .
rachel come on .
do you want me to go ?
i know it 's crazy , but -- i ca n't just leave . do n't argue with me . if i 've learned anything , it 's that the problems of two people do n't add up to a hill of ants in this world . or beans . something like that . anyway , i 've < u > got to warn the others < /u > .
mickey told me to come back to work .
that 's what you think ?
and if he can not be found , no other knight will champion me , though you beseeched each and every one of them . why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy ?
if you do n't let go , doctor jones , we 'll both die .
impotent .
you killed my friend !
then talk to your brother , goddamn it . the two of you do n't need any advice to get into trouble .
all right , we may be insignificant , imperfect creatures -- but we 're all we 've got .
i suppose that 's good , unless things were fine the way they were .
hey the door was open .
do n't do it , norman !
no !
gus ?
i do n't know .
hey -- those are my files --
a man after my own heart . straight to the point . what 's different about arcade is the way it reacts . it responds like a human does . it learns . it adapts . each time you play , it changes its strategy .
why did n't you live together ?
the way you talk . never heard a woman talk like that .
'cause you always tell me the right thing to do .
no really ... i guarantee i could get you a date in like two seconds ...
the manager 's door is metal .
he 's cute ... and he 's got a crush on you ... but ...

without question .
what you 're doing for me is n't worth it ... believe me !
a mr. summers and a man called lother .
it 's an order . get everyone out now .
i found this at your brother抯 .
damn , you are the real thing ...
yes , even i had a mother . she was part austrian , but she was still my mother . my childhood was like a tennis match ; they bounced me back and forth , here and there ...
i 'll find someplace .
from the psychiatric end .
k through sixth .
`` rosebud ? i 'll tell you about rosebud .
i 'm glad you 're around to say it .
i can do that , too .

you 're talking very fast .
you can kiss them if you want . fell them . they 're getting hard .
i do n't notice anyone else complaining .
i ca n't dude ! we all took a sacred oath , and swore ourselves to secrecy !
it 's the guard in the storeroom .
then you 'll do it ?
hold me . i 'm falling !
how would i know .
do i know you ?
no , of course i 'm gon na make the movie ! i 've already pre髎old alabama and oklahoma . those repressed okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff . so we 'll just make it without that she-male . we 'll fictitionalize it .
what 's on your mind ?
how is the house ?
sandro ... maybe it 's best that you go in alone .
what 's your hurry ?
i do n't understand .
is n't it wonderful ? bela lives !
well , i guess we drop him off at the hospital . since he do n't know nothin ' about us , i say it 's his decision .
that idiot !
that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .
maybe more .
american literature . what else ?
apparently not . look , it 's a shit storm here right now . when are you coming back ? i do n't know what to tell people any more .
yes .
... see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he could n't play football anymore . if that had n't happened , we would n't have been together .
the car accident ? any of this ringing a bell ?
the guy from usa today is here .
you decide . today is your day .
i ... i stayed at a friend 's . listen , i --
the rains started to come , and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up , and tell us when to move -- but we did n't mind the rain comin ' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there , watchin ' the guards and they weapons get wet , and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute . i was laughin ' all over inside -- a minute , that 's all , but what a minute it was !
this is a one-way argument . we 've got six days ; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we 'll come home . if you do n't go ? well , that 's a much bigger deal . i go to london right after that . so , it 'd be very big deal if you stay here . the plane 's boarding . you 're good at deadline . here 's your ticket .
we always help our friends , do n't we ? it is no secret that the government has lost a lot of popularity because of you , my boy . there are some that think that at the next election we shall be out . the press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do .
hancock led the boston 'tea party ' because he 's a goddamned tea smuggler ! he was n't protesting inequality , he was eliminating competition . now , you listen to me : we need to get a southerner elected commander-in-chief , or the south will not fight ! what have we been struggling for all these years ? for this moment ! and , if we fail now , remember : you stopped us !
and i appreciate that impulse .
we should tell him we 're not going .
i should go
hey , harding , wake me in an hour .
yeah .
you 're no good for this business . it 's just a joke to you ...

there always one kid with no bodily controls . we had this dude , jeff baxter , he was a puker . the fucker would just sit there puke all over himself .
i do n't want to see any more beef jerky . i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window . it 's drivin ' me crazy . the whole car smells like it .

and may i say that 's a gorgeous tie .
tell me about von der null .
you 're a monster .
the cobra 's waitin ' to strike , chica .
you know who ?
i 'm not a gladiator . i refuse to fight .
my umbrella ? oh , that 's just a relic . i found it when i was packing to come to america . it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition . a long time ago .
a little too well , if anything , a little too well , that 's my only fear , compadre .
we are the choices we 've made , robert .

when you get to ostia , use this -- bribe passage to africa or spain . save my family . you should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to egypt then to numidia .

karl , maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner . it 's a nice night .
they did when they were in the carolina league .
oh sure , me'n pam malavesi used to help her do alterations for old mrs. lippman . lots of people worked for her , she had the business from all these retail stores ? but she was like , totally old , it was more'n she could handle .

i do n't know what you 're into with the king pin , but whatever it is we get a piece , understand ? we get a big piece . if we find out you 're keeping us out , i may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to moonan myself . say something stupid if we got a deal , jake .
this is a hot run . beat it . you 're late .
eh , i 'll call them myself . but i do need your help with something very urgent .
forget why . do you want it or not ?
you 're entitled .
what about neddy ?
i do n't know . where did you hear that name .
there are men in this world who demand to be killed . they argue in gambling games ; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender . these people wander through the streets calling out `` kill me , kill me . '' luca brasi was like that . and since he was n't scared of death , and in fact , looked for it ... i made him my weapon . because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him . i think you have done the same with this man .
where 'd a sweet southern boy learn to fight like that ?
steed
give me that . now , listen to me , mister , i do n't know what you think you 're doing , but demolishing a building does n't fall under the definition of 'help ' ! there 's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
hey . it 's raining .
oh , is this ... ? god . first one of these i have n't been in for a long time .
mister laplante ...
yeah , it does n't look like he 's gon na make it as a dangerous tough guy ...

i was n't used to being big -- was n't used to thinking in big ways . now , i 've made up my mind .
yes , but the very end , when he actually died , that was extremely sudden . you know , alan and i were recently speaking of dying . told me boyd aviation took out a lot of insurance on him . you must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy .
who engineered this getaway ?
this saturday , mom , remember ? we told you .
i was born outside london , the only son of a minister who was a master at harrow . grandfather was a bishop . church of ... church of eng ...

that 's why he did n't get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he could n't answer . why did n't he go and direct in america , like that italian , toscanini .

more than you know . is there anything else ?
it is suicide .

no use in getting tough . that 'll get you nowhere , mr. deeds . you know , we 've got letters .
what 's the matter ?
all in all , quite a canoe ...
you murdered her !
i dabble in pharmaceuticals , medical research . we 've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate , a few others things .
i 'm not made of glass .
who ?
we ca n't . we 've managed to get inside the one place that 's safe . i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements . if we go outside , we 're risking more lives . you have to accept it , margo , there 's nothing we can do . the building must be swarming with police by now . it wo n't take long for them to get through the doors .
howard , you 'll serve no more than two years , then he 'll pardon you .
can i see you later ?
thanks for coming .
bon soir , mademoiselle !

i 'd like to speak for himself , okay ?
yes .
yeah , well maybe she 'll make it you . is that it ? you worried she 'll use me against you ?
what 'd ya got there ?
with the right energy , we can stabilize the storm . maybe tie into the city grid ...
love . passion . obsession , all those things you told me to wait for . well , they 've arrived .
you 're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to ... 'boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry . '

make sure he gets those shots .
oh , and senator ... ? love you suit .

and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did n't work out so well .
well , why not ? you seem so calm and experienced . why not , indeed !
of course . i do n't want no okie from muscogee . i can get that right here in port angeles .
ilene , we do n't really know that .
do n't be silly ... i 'm old . do n't look at me like that , please . why 'd you come back ?
i used you as a diversion . while you were getting captured upstairs , i was shredding documents in the basement . deep down , i guess i was just jealous . you were one incredible thief ...
you 're talking like a madman .
every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month . it 's your job , ted , to decide which of them is right .
jesus !
i 'm just saying ...
what 's she saying ?
but i do n't need treadment .
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules . in the myth , bellerophon killed chimera , a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world . i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon .
mef ? what 's mef ?
oh dear . if one must have a clinical name .
this way . hold it this way . good .
hello , peter .
you 're anya rosson , are n't you ? i 've heard of you back in new york .

unh-huh . which would make you half angel .
okay .

in the chest and stomach .
that never changes . you know , when you and grandma are gone , the family 's gone . i never see the cousins anymore .
it 's complicated ... i guess i 'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it 's hidden , or something ...
lou .
no !
because ... i have to relax .
then i guess i 'm going by myself .
aaron , will you tell me ?
i do n't see how you could know about these things unless elliot 's been talking to you .
almost eight . you would n't believe how weird i look naked .
... you need some old forms that she had ... somebody 's dying ...
new york 's finest . this is his case .
the night is young .

boris ? do i look a fright ?
your majesty shall mock at me ; i can not speak your england .
i 'm delighted .
no .
he 's already got ta be a part of sid 's life . what do you know about this derek ?
no such luck . i saw it running down one of the corridors .
and again . how would you get him on land ?
better pray the worm 's a sound sleeper , jack .
so i gathered .
i think you 're in anaphylactic shock --
thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop .
i have no idea - i just want to ...
we 've touched on this , his own witness has said ...
sorry to disappoint you ...
i was there .
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes .
i think i 'll go see debi today .
oh , i see ... your mentor , perhaps ?
certainly not .
it says they 're probably very small -- like my height -- because , as their brains developed , there was no use for physical development . it says they 're probably vegetarians , because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet .
i shivved him .
please ... i 'd like to go ...
lose something ?
well , mickey and mallory ca n't be together . so , we 'll put you on one of our prison busses and you 'll take mallory first , then you 'll come back for mickey .

me ? oh , uh . no .
i can make my own decisions .
i 'm really glad we 're having this conversation . you 're right . i was angry at you . but talking about it -- the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault . can you ever forgive me ?
you did n't do it to me , will ; it 's happened to us . and if i survive the wallpaper we 'll be okay ... he 's after you now , is n't he ?
soon . first , i must bless this house .
bastards ! come back here and face me !
yes . with your `` prestige '' it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of american tel and tel .
how 's your shoulder ?
anything you want , boss .
the tyrell corporation has a demo model . check it out on the voight-kampff . there 's a chance the nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect . if that 's the case , everybody 's up shit creek .
it has to be tom . you said he ripped up his own pictures , he --
believe me i know .
well sir , i did n't really think it was necessary . you see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam . here , have a look .
by heaven , i thank you ! i will be your apothecary !
you and charlie are taking the jap home , tonight .
well , do we just go on up ? !
i love lila . i mean , she 's a wonderful person . and ... she loves me ! that 's no small potatoes . i mean she really loves me . she 's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me . and she 's a good person . a truly good person . how rare is that in this world , eh ? and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection , if it can even be called that . i mean , god knows i 'm not perfect ! what about my eyesight ? it 's lousy , that 's what ! lila 's not going to leave me because of my eyesight . what about my penis ?
what 's it narrow down to ?
yah .
-- richard .
dieter 's gone to shoot a still job . hong kong .
look , you need me to sign an invoice or somethin ' ?
why do n't you leave him alone ?
oh god , what did you say , you dumb bitch ?
i waited up till midnight .
hey really , i do n't feel so great .
3jane 's the only person beside tessier that knows the code .
like what ?
the first day of the delmar meet , there was a nag called bluebell . i should have been on it . but that was the day after you came in here , so i stuck around to see how you were gon na be .
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out .
that 's crazy !
from here on , i dish it out .
really , dude , you surprise me . they 're not gon na kill shit . they 're not gon na do shit . what can they do ? fuckin ' amateurs . and meanwhile , look at the bottom line . who 's sitting on a million fucking dollars ? am i wrong ?
well , you know about his past . and when you said to look for signs of aggression ... he was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher .
no ! do n't bring it up . i do n't want to think about that now . let me enjoy this hour of bliss . i 'll think about all of that later . in the meantime , nobody mentions the v word .
twenty-five this time .
but , why ?
you think i 'm just one of those italian casanovas . the guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way . who prey on unhappily married women . who lure unsuspecting --
what is he doing here ?
there 's no hard evidence he knew about this . anybody who could implicate him seems to 've vanished .
there 's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid . is that our steven ?
i want to see you , terry .
it 's ok. do n't worry about it . accidents happen .
yeah .
and then ?
see ?
get the hell out of here . i do n't want you bringing our food . send a real waiter .
can i ... can i t-t-talk to you ?
ripley ... she does n't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic .
how old is she ?
who is this ?
history , leonard . < u > history < /u > . everything else is conversation ... how 's the other matter ?
... as ... you ... wish ...
initiate launch sequence .
us . you mean the watchmen .
well , how come i laid nine ?
i was n't --
ms. nevins , nurse-anesthetist ; dr. marx , of course ...
well , let me put it this way : i can not achieve an erection while in the presence of another person . so , for all practical purposes , i am impotent .
where we going ?
i hate her !
ice cream !
i 'm averting my eyes , lord .
well , i 'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents . but if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your job , which would you pick . and , while you hesitate , permit me to suggest that they are one and the same . your country and your job .
not much to see , i 'm afraid . i 'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe .
hey , kind of under a little pressure here .
now i think captain 's punishment is fair , considerin ' . in fact i think you ai n't got shit ta complain about .
i never said that .
hello ... oh , johnny ... !
like i had to say it ? no , i wanted to say it .
i always thought i 'd have a crack at this chair one day .
you remind me of my uncle .
he 's an idiot , and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks .
not true , sir . it was only a slight tolchock . she was breathing , i swear it .
you do n't have ...
i 'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows .
recluse . kinder word .
excuse me .
it 's a little boxy thing , norm , with switches on it ... lets my computer talk to the one there ...
looks to me like your out of business . now i want some answers .
when did i leave ?
same car .
did you have to tell her my name ?
it is time to clarify the situation . everything is over between us .
i 'm getting her out of there !
what went down between you and riviera ?
she did n't ! this is manslaughter , not murder . she did n't consciously kill that baby . she 'd lost a lot of blood . she was unconscious by the time we got to her .
fine work , pete ! you certainly delivered the goods . i 'm proud of you .
again , i do n't mean to be annoying with my questions . but if it < u > is < /u > a crocodile which i do n't think it is . and if they < u > do < /u > charge these baby hatchling sounds ... why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time ? with you it makes sense .
i thought you 'd like a ride to work . you do n't own a cat , do you ?
i think the big question here is where are you , if you do n't mind my saying so , and i think i know where you are . you 're running . on the run . you 're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship , and you 're just going to hit it again with ian but it 's going to be with a world music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing `` doctor who '' -watching twit who does n't really understand you , not the way that i do and will more in the future , and you 'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you 're in now , only later . and with ... him .
what if they serve soup ?
mollie malloy -- what happened to her ?
john !
miles , it 's sunday . you promised to take the kids to raging waters today .
what 's wrong with him ?
bring her to starboard .
where is he ?
oh , that 's karl . i met him at the laundrymat . karl , this is my mama . and vaughan , vaughan 's the manager . he lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they 're best friends .
but they 're not human ! dr. forrester says they 're some kind of an advanced civilization --
don reynard .
jesus . what a bunch of useless zombies .
what 's wrong , norman ?
there is nothing in that statement the president ca n't explain .
i 'll let you off while it 's still daylight .
you gim me this bullshit psychic friends theory , you believe that dumbshit trucker , you believe this woman ...
what ? but you been working so hard --
i 'm not going , janet .
what do they do that they had to kill her ?
now : where ?
runs in the family .
her name is thea ?
what you mean talk to her ?
the event horizon sensors show the same thing : `` bio-readings of indeterminate origin . '' right before that wave hit the clark , there was some kind of surge , right off the scale , but now it 's back to its previous levels .
i do n't believe that .
anytime .
you got it .
you and i are gon na straighten this out with the sheriffs , and then we 'll wait for the man to call . when he gives the word , we move .
want to come to the study group ?
yes .
no .
i did . and his stomach is out of whack . so they need him for a couple of days .
jezuz christ !
there 's no correlation at all between where they 're kidnapped and where they 're found ... ? what if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites ? do they converge at all ?
oh , yes . i know about mr. rawlston .
so do you .
what about cortina ?
wonderful woman .
watch it , dipshit . you wan na rip the fuckin ' bag ?
then why do you persist in doing it ?
she says she 'll be here tomorrow ... !
you sure ?
yes , the little ratfuckers are now running our government .
no more fights .
we 're all very proud of you , harry , but what the hell is it ?
yes . we know they 're toxic , but the animals do n't eat them .
oh , god . that 's two more than me . tell me it gets better .
a half hour .
is that customary ?
a few days ... a few weeks - dunno , i ca n't remember . worse thing is , i never know if it will change back again ... now , please leave me alone .
i 'll be damned if that was n't a wrong number ?
how 'd you get that ? playing with your pitchfork ?
my grandfather 's work was doo-doo ! dead is dead ! there 's only one thing i am interested in ... and that is the preservation of life !
only once , at redstone .
what did you call me ?
ahoy !
i ca n't stop thinking about that poor teacher . goodnight , honey . do n't read late , we 've got a big day with the birds tomorrow .
nice . but right out of our brochure .
why was there another team ?
unless we 're supposed to whack out the fuckin ' pilot , i do n't think we 're gon na have to work in the next five hours .
a ray of oneness piercing the solitude . falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh . you 'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire .
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals . looking for me .
yeah , like maybe never .
you see what you get when you fuck wit me , white boy ? you 're gon na walk in my goddamn house , my house ! gon na come in here and tell me ! talkin ' smack , in my house , in front of my employees . shit ! your ass must be crazy . i do n't think that white boy 's got good sense . hey , marty . he must of thought it was white boy day . it ai n't white boy day , is it ?
then it is decided . leo and durk and i will make our plans .
marks , scars , i dunno . anything could happen i guess .
we 're closed , sir .
we 're making too much of this .
good . very good . tibet is a great country . a wonderful history . long ago , you even conquered part of china . but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you . in twenty years time you could be ahead of us . then it will be your turn to help china .
anybody got any ideas ?
i trust you .
someone 's gon na die someday causa that bum , going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of mr. oh .
you saved kendall 's life --
you lied to me all along ! lies , all lies . your mother , your father , what story are you on now ? how come the town did n't know you was his daughter ?
it 'll be fine .
oh ... i 'll think of something ... what are you doing here ?
seriously ? what did they say ?
what do you mean ?
let 's try it again , only this time i 'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth . when i do that i want you to massage my tongue with yours . that 's what first base is .
and you have this letter of intent ?
what killed them i wo n't even write about . i tell you , they 'd do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
could be . beard looks phony . it 's when i 'm unpredictable . they ca n't stand that . that 's why we 've got to get out of here . can you come with me ?

no , no , < u > wait < /u > ...
no . no . let me tell you something . directing 's the best preparation possible for fatherhood . the sleep depravation alone .
and my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more .
course and speed ?
what the hell are you saying ?
i 'm very sorry .
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they ca n't see . i ca n't see nuthin ' , so it 's all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it 's all the same to me .

i mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that .
are you kidding , it looks great . you wear this to a business meeting , you 're the badass in the room . but you can go out dancing in this too . it 's a total power suit .
i 've got a deposition that i really need to get cracking on , so if you do n't mind ...
`` do n't want '' the dodgers to lose or the summer to end . but we do n't get to choose these things ...
you worked for it -- if you 're sure that 's all you want .

oh , god ...
boys like the one you met today are surplus . commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into . we improve some lives buying them where they抮e not wanted , improve still more selling them where they are . is that too hard for you ?
what could happen to him , darling ? you must n't worry ... . what is it ?

hello , claire . how extraordinary that you came .
when i count three , shoot out the bottles behind him !
yo !
for a little over two years now we 've been spotting serious blowback in imf operations . we have a penetration . the other day we decoded a message on the internet from a czech we know as `` max . ''
not exactly , sugar ... one reason we 're in all the trouble we 're in right now is cause of what i was doin ' ... i tried to tell you this before ...
... just be smart about it .
i might have his number on campus .
i can see that . why ?
hey , chili . get your coat , but do n't piss the guy off , okay ? it could get complicated and we 'd have to call momo to straighten it out . then momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we do n't need that .
oh , yes .
what is it , treves ?
i 'm afraid they 'll kill them ! we saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man 's heart out !
do it !
oh , you 're there . you sound out of breath .
shut up lloyd . you 're not married yet .
i get that impression .
do you like the way i feel ?
and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think . it unifies the entire world on a single level . everything is completely connected . sometimes i can really feel it , everything around us , just a small part of a whole . it 's really wonderful .
did i hear a car ?
try barney clark .
you 're better than i expected .
i just hope this is still good up there .

what about the other things you 've reported ? -- -- being followed on the --
joe knows what you 're saying , just being polite --
no , i do n't , i uh ... it got burned up . everything in the car got the shit burned out of it . all i got left is what i have on ...
oh my god -- and you are looseleaf harper .
i know she must be a really passionate person .
thanks . a lot .
addictive is n't it ? just say no . until i say yes . a little fringe benefit of working with me . now here 's the concept , counselor . crime . my i.q. , your ak-47 . you help me gather production capital so i can produce enough of these to create an empire that will eclipse bruce wayne 's forever . and , in return i will help you solve the greatest riddle of all . who is batman ?
cluster of events . do n't see something , ten years , allasudden . three times inna night .
he 's just playing big brother .
do you know which way ?
no , not that i recall , i was asleep .
of course there is . look -- the veranda room -- right there .
oh , it totally does . i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing . but you know , boys have endured worse things for nookie .
what ?
he 's the dude ...
yeah . why 's there five checks ? there 's only four of us .
okay honey . that sounds nice . jeffrey . i think you 've got termites in the house .
i 'm willing to take a cut in pay .
and i 'll never do it again . forgive me ?
the apple core ?
very popular . are you staying long ?
sheila ?
very well .
he starts this - buzzing in me , in my head . he makes me feel violated ... you used me , mr. crawford .
i do n't think so .
guinan ? i do n't know what you 're talking about .
the dragon ! there ...
where 's my family ?
you 'd better be , bro . you better be .
mister tully .
by the way -- did you hear a shot last night ?
where is the key ?
well , when you get up on the radio , all you have to do is say the whole thing 's a frame-up . make you a hero sure as you 're born !
sir ! sir , the door -- it 's opening .
colwyn , do n't be a fool . you ca n't do battle with that thing .
i think you 're right .
i just might do that .
just in town on business . just in and out . ha ha ! a little of the old in-and-out !
no ! oh no ! three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! the police wo n't even go in there any more .
he 's canadian .
in other times , with other purposes , there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for j.d . singer 's return from war . last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war . but it was the civil war -- in angola -- and he was in it for the money .
you the only cat do n't come on with that `` whatcha know , daddy '' jive ; and you do n't cuss none .
i dunno ... would i have to take classes and stuff ?
he 's allergic .
that 's terrific . you did it . you really changed the course of your destiny .
... everything .
good evening , mr. baxter .
well , i 'd really hope to rent it for ...
it did ?
yeah .
mary clarence -- you 're alive !
then we can not go .
oh , you 're not gon na believe what they put me in charge of . they sent for the ambassador 's personal chinese investigator type . he is like the baddest asian shield they got . and i , let me repeat that , i am the man who is on the case with him . just the two of us , alone , workin ' the whole deal as a team .
sure ! but nobody knows it . least of all you . look , would you mind if i gave you some constructive criticism ?
jim , do n't . you 're scaring him .
great .
why wait ?
it 's better to be free , right ?
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with ?
i 've got ta tell you , my friend : this is one of the ballsiest moves i 've ever been privy to . i never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy .
yes , that 's because i 'm getting to her .
at first , it hardly seemed more than a routine fire .
try the emergency channels ...
oh , ben gets through everything .
what 's normal ?
i 'll see if i can , you know , work things out .
same here . i 've watched you in action . very impressive .
but i saw these women . i saw their mutilated bodies . i saw their ghosts . i just know it happened i can feel it ...
drive .
i 'm afraid not , mrs. mulwray . these men are my operatives and at some point they 're going to assist me . i ca n't do everything myself .
oh dear . have i made a blunder ?
that is sad .
the speedometer . and it was downhill there .
you 've got one going , mrs. mulwray .
34,000. but they 're real short lines . 'just came out that way .
right . i hear they can be kind of a time-suck .
... -onds ... with just a fraction of what 's in ...
i bought it . both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me ; stocks went up , so i do n't have to touch my principal .
'course i am -- but does n't mean i wo n't leave you here . if you believe anything about me , better be that .
oh ! we ought to try and carry dorothy .
mrs. mulwray , you do n't want to run around like that .
thought i 'd stay in . there 's a good tittie movie on skinemax .
help , i 'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory .
and if we evacuate , what do you want to do with o'brien ?
sure . i 'm starting an 800 hotline . caught part of your phone call . and even if i had n't , there 's the dark pinstripe , armani , elegant , not too hip , which rules out advertising , plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of , looks like bottega ...
because if you do n't give me that cylinder , your lives will end ...
oh , like jekyll and hyde ! ah , i 've always wanted to play jekyll and hyde ! i 'm looking forward to this production .
wait ! ask him if he 'd give me some money now . tell him if he would , that would help me finish it .
okay . sure .
animal husbandry is science , dr. hartdegen . i have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years . i have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns , social behavior and breeding . empirical , exacting , quantifiable records .
i know , but ...
what ?
and they picked up ! i mean , it would n't be filthy , with coke bottles and whiskey , and those signs everywhere ...
i 've got an idea , but you 're not going to like it .
yeah , and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle .
amazing . i hate to say it , but it is .
i think i have the necessary papers . is there a ladies room ...
that 's my lovin ' man . just ca n't get enough .
cupid stupid ! that 's the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom . call that fresh ? there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit . you should open a butcher 's , not a grocer 's .
goodnight .
it will , it just has n't bottomed out yet , give it time .
i do n't know anything about this . well , i mean , i know a < u > little < /u > about -- from a certain perspective . my point is , i do n't want to do anything foolish .
we were set up , the cops were waiting for us .
that 's swell . how are you ?
ca n't do it .
would it be painful for you ?
no , think of something else .
south central .
i consider it less my failure than his .
if we would walk out so soon , it would only call attention to us . perhaps ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe .
yeah . is it ...
and we did n't come down here to audition . business auditions for us ... ... and know who we are and know they want their load run by us < u > before < /u > nicholas calls .
good , good . drinking some good wines and kicking back , you know . so what 's happening ? still no word ?
what do my eyes see ?
you have to tell me who did it .
if there were a man like that , with a kink in his brain around here loose , what would he be like .
you do n't get it , do you ? we 're shit . d'amour .
you care for me . and you 're concerned . and i have to start living my life again . i hear it from mrs. watchit every day .
your classmates ?
i 'm sorry . sam had to do a new crown , we had [ ? ] , and jason had a sore throat . your big graduation , and no one was there .
did you send in all of the deposit checks ?
you do n't know what you meant - because you do n't know me .
you 'll never get away with it , miss andrews . your father 'll stop you before you get half way to new york .
how did you find me ?
it 's beautiful .
i 'm gon na kick his ass !
no , thank you . just keep me company for a while .
no . she 's dead !
yes , admiral ... . soon .
huh ?
get your reserve bottle and let 's go .
no , it 's nothin ' ... i 'm all right .
i do n't want to talk about it .
no kat , i lied to you , i hate england and i do n't ever want to live there again .
how about if i set the table ?
it 's beautiful . where 'd you get it ?
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit ... play with the levers and things . maverick well , get used to it .
how about i pick one out for you ?
nothing . he 's like you , he does n't say much .
yes , and on 'dictis ' .
nice to meet you , stacy .
what ? what for ?
i was once . richard ! ? richard norvik ? i did n't recognize you .
someone broke into the cavern last night .
well , just relax , will ya . you 're makin ' me nervous .
proud ? i 'm just embarrassed that i like when they say those things .
harry , we found the real thing to be thankful for . screw george washington !
what do you have in mind ?
oh , fine .
just out of curiosity , how did they get our address ?
get to what ?
still got mine on , not a speck of blood on it . not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours ?
my god , what do you think ?
the lamp was burning all night in his room . caravaggio was there with him .
oh , do n't do this !
oh aye , a sledge .
come on inna dining room .
only when i work .
no , doc , not a doll . i am panda . i 'm talking about much , much more than a doll . the world has never seen what i 'm talking about ... except maybe in the movies .
i wo n't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
yeah .
hey , nick , you ever do it with one of those slants ?
ed , the landlord called again . he wants his money .
god , it 's so clean out here .
well , then , we must give the wrong kind of shows .
right . when you 've done that , do n't waste any time getting out of there . once that crane starts moving ... well , it 's bound to provoke some kind of response .
good morning , your highness .
yeh ? who else ?
well . 'least now we 're talking the same language . so one standard . is that what you 're after ?
hey , man .
i 've been cured .
... so what does all that add up to ?
and i 'm telling you there 's nothing there to explore .
they 're still in the house .
no .
what 's that mean ?
general mcaddie 's .
what do you mean ?
you 're such an asshole .
not enough , i guess .
what are you talking about ?
she was sailing up north , right ?
about brad 's family ?
about ten dollars .
are you talking ?
i have not been able to face him yet .
the mold ? i am living among these crypto-fascist orange county cunts ... with daddy 's bmw and the boob job ... just waiting to implode .
any sign of dangerous ionization ?
probably not .
i do n't want it .
work that jab , work that hook , work that jab , okay , take a break , take a break .
you got a deal , mister . i mean santa .
it ca n't be true !
goddamn ! they put oswald together from day one ! like some dummy corporation in the bahamas - you just move him around a board . sent him to russia , in and out , no passport problems . you got the word `` microdots '' in his notebook , you got the minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions , the sealed diz201 personnel file . for all we know , there could be a dozen oswalds in different cities , countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination . does the real oswald know he 's been put together ? who knows . it does n't matter , does it ? he 's a low level spy , he does n't know who he really works for ...
if there is a god , how could he let this happen ? ? ! !
delighted , i 'm sure .
what are they ?
in her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here . she would call me , and i would come by .
how are you holding up ?
i do n't get you bruce wayne .
twenty years i 've led men to die . for me it was the glory of rome . but that was something . if it was n't that , then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something ! these men here are butchered for laughs ! their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line !
i started wondering -- if you could n't switch back -- would it make a difference ?
it 's on the television .
maybe it is ! how the fuck would you know ? ! you do n't know a fucking thing ! you ca n't get scared , can you get angry ? !
i ask for justice .
flight is a scientific impossibility .
it might have .
chairman mao can keep china . just give us back tibet .
right ?
who is that ? ! gaddamn voices come into the house ... sons of bitches ...
uh , vince . sorry . this wo n't wait .
hindenburg ...
created ?
it probably has the dumper 's name . it might give us some kind of new lead . i want a look at it anyhow .
where downstairs ?
i 'm so sorry , i did n't notice much .
right .
what 's that ?
blade 's unique , you know . a one in a billion anomaly . he can withstand sunlight , garlic , even silver . but he still has the thirst .
well do n't get carried away -- i 'm not that good at it .
just sit here for a moment . you seem very upset .
who knows ...
what did laura say ? do you know why she left ?
no we ca n't . that 's the problem . god knows it would beat hanging around with you !
i do n't know what you 're talking about . i just wan na see ganz nailed .
what 's going on ? who started this ?
my brain is shrinking . there 's only so much room .
what do you mean , 'cleaned up ? '
when he finds out .
the junior pathologist at ashford hospital . then the husband of a colleague of mine , then a trainee radiologist , then the service manager at my garage .
must be some sort of gateway . but , why this place ... ?
whatever .
do you sail ?
what are you doing here ?
unh-uh , pal . you 've got yourself mixed up with somebody else .
what happened ?
how do you know ? huh ? when nobody knows that much ?
michael meyers .
exactement !
the 1000 c infrared sensitive film must be handled in total darkness . i keep the samples straight by touch code . it 's still easier to handle than a 1200 series . think it 'll do ?
i do n't mean believe , like believing in a religion . i mean , do you believe it has power ? do you think it could heal a sick person ?
now who 's gon na take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you ?
slip up and change into a skirt , else he 'll create something terrible . do n't you want to make a good impression on your first day ?
catch you later !
she said that ? oh , my lord , she said that ?
yeah , guess it must have been a slow news day ...
sure ... sure , it 's his house .
no , come on . anywhere you want .
... i believe , unless i 'm very much mistaken - see , we 've been away for several years , uh ...
hey , i 'm new here , what do you want ?
i 'll be okay , just get me home .
no ... we 're together ...
yeah , mr. cobb said stick to your tail no matter what .
sharp shirt , jake ... .
you never eat when you 're despondent .
i 'm not going to get up an ' leave you . now let 's go over to el 's an ' have a good time .
that is the story of my life .
ben , i do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse . i need you to be patient for a little while longe --
a wolf without a foot !
it becomes an addiction .
hey , watcha doing with that dog ?
they hid in a broom closet !
i better just go in and see her .
it 's only four days .
by the time he gets to the corner newstand , he 's got her meeting some rich guy on the train , the rich guy 's asked her to marry him , and he 's reading about it in the morning edition .
how are the parental units functioning these days ?
the answer is george jefferson .
do something , jonathan ! kill it !
... i 'm sorry .
maybe you should be a patient and sit down .
bye .
i 'm sorry , i just hallucinated .
if he has anything to say about it , yeah . i 've been asking a lot of questions and i do n't like the answers i 'm getting . he 's made a lot of people nervous , including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star .
eh ?
i 've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen .
no , nothing like that . the ottos are what i 'd call model citizens . they 're regular at town meetings . they give their opinions in a respectful way . they always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they are n't church goers .
here , i did n't get any .
you are n't going to get a mistrial , boy . we 're going back this afternoon , we 're going to try this case to an end . now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail .
wait ... she 's crying . i finish . i hold up my finger like `` wait a second '' . they sit in silence for , like , at least five minutes . i look up and they all start clapping , and now they 're all crying . even the camera guy .
i am captain renault , prefect of police .
no .
he does n't give a damn about me .
you 're a dead man , macready -- or a dead whatever the hell you are !
i mean . some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered .
maybe another time .
shhh .
i ca n't wait .
never heard of it . it 's got no day or date . hell , it ai n't even got numbers . what 's the matter ? you could n't afford a timex ?
fifty 's an exaggeration . anyway , that was a different moment . things were possible that are n't now .
`` attempted . '' at-tempt-ted ! i 'm not happy about having to steal that horse , but i do have my pride . face it , when it comes to burglary , and sex , i ... .
fats , let 's you and i shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game .
joking ? no , ma'am . oh no ! i mean business !
okay , okay . i 'll call the girl .
like i said , open container , p.i. , misdemeanor possession . easy to make it disappear . for you , poof , it 's gone .
i do n't care about the dooley sisters - what time did he get in ?
you were wrong , it did hurt .
yeah , i want some pie .
of course , yes . if you 'll excuse me just a moment --
what happened , pilgrim ?
victims . are n't we all .
patrick , i think he knows you 're here . it 's only ten-thirty .
yeah . come on .
i 'm not ! !
after all you 've seen ... after man 's entire journey ... you still believe that ?
oh , right . well then , just shake hands .
bullshit ! you hate us . if you had half a chance you 'd feed us to them !
yeah , my feet are cold ...
ooooooh ! his reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd .
i 'd say charcoal .
-- from czechoslovakia ? and how long have they been livin ' in your building ? alright , i 'll be in touch when we know somethin ' . milos and tamina karlova . they were quiet and kept to themselves . landlord do n't know who your girl is .
good morning , gentlemen . i 'm mr. daniels , the manager . i believe i 've spoken to one of you on the phone .
hello mr. kastle . junior , long time . i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden !
yes ! you shall . of course you shall --
that 's a movie , you moron .
... not if i can help it .
murders and rapes in the cities . people bomb planes ... can the police stop them ? < u > no < /u > . but feed one little cow to a crocodile ...
`` put the corporation at risk '' ... ? give me a fucking break !
wait ... you still feel something for that bitch ?
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here .
what ?
no particular reason . catch a laker game . i heard we got shaquille ...
how 'd you know i would n't ?
naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it 's called `` heaven . ''
i think we got a white house consultant linked to the bugging .
watch me .
just wondered what ?
i told you they were there .
he brought that up from the wreck .
i told you !
conrad , what a surprise . gesundheit .
well , there 's a message on his answering machine saying he went to london .
six of us left . if we could get through that canyon and lose just one , that 'd be quite a fucking feat , huh ? a good thing , right ?
yeah and we do n't have much ammo either !
sorry , bleek ... going for my ultrasound . got ta note and everything .
odd desire for anyone .
no , not that . i was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror ?
jason ? he 's on this ship ? !
these eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives .
it is . it 's very warm . i wonder how long it will last ?
no , dad .
ca n't help it ... ahh ...
... i wanted to make you happy .
no . her sponsors here saw the thing on the net . i do n't think they liked it .
if you insist .
i was all out of dynamite !
open the door . we 're late .
well , i thought i 'd maybe take in a hoedown .
how 'd you get here , earl ?
i 'd say you give a good dollar value .
went to high school with him . but ...
how 's the chicken ?
it 's too big .
what do we do here , david ?
forty-two was a lean year around here . the war had just started ... you were gone less than a month ... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall . not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket , and a chicken 's as good as money if you ask me . at that time , it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures .
this morning .
it does n't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane .
divinity ?
this is my territory now . you are my responsibility .
we should check the records , and , we should talk to lynn .
burglary , count one -- 8 to 10 years ; count two , 8 to 10 years ; count three , 8 to 10 years ...
nice .
yeah , who 's this ?
i do n't have any answers for you .
why do you say this to me when you know i will kill you for it ?
they fill seven floors . we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world . just to give you an idea , there are more than three million insects specimens . not to mention amphibians , reptiles , birds , anthropological artifacts , meteorites , minerals and gems . only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display .
you new ?
oh , and why am i an asshole ?
yesterday you were wondering about the wall . how it was possible .
he 's an illusionist . it 's not exactly brain surgery .
yes .
i 'd advise you to hurry .
look , a person does a certain thing and that 's all there is to it . it becomes what he is . why fight it ? what do you know ? how long you been a hack , a couple months ? you 're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in .
a boost . a big boost ...
elizabeth , i 'm relieved you 're safe . clap him in irons . and behind his back this time .
should we go outside and bring him in ?
morpheus will take him when he 's ready .
what ?
i am sure .
all right . get him .
go ! go !
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind .
good ! it should n't take more than a few seconds .
maxie 's fucking with me . he put you with the spook to get under my skin .
that 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . do n't be offended , lad . a man who 's got no ethics is a free man . i envy you that . beside , i can hardly blame you . that grace has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? eh ?
do n't hold it against him . he just never got caitlin out of his system . it 's not your fault . it 's dante . i do n't know thing one about chicks . do you want to cry or something ? i can leave .
oh , shit . take your time ! do n't get suckered ! this man is a murderer ! in his career he 's killed over a thousand gladiators . please , just take the fall !
whatcha looking in there for ? we ca n't afford any of that .
a ten percent raise and benefits . but that 's it . i 'm drawing the line .
what ?
it 's okay . edward told me . your secret 's safe with me .
where is home ?
you can always get another girl .
please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position .
that 's it ...
i do n't think so .
look .
it 's better than a good sale . it 's a ...
ha ha ha . you are funny . really , how much will you be needing ?
i 'm not .
the guy i told you about - aaron ... ? he says i can learn to control them . that i could lose the gloves at some point .
my jacket ? gee , great ... your show looks great . quite a turnout . you look great . you kids . you drink red wine with fish . you can do anything ! make paintings in the basement of your gallery ? first time i 've heard of that !
yeah , they could .
if they 're still alive ...
you do n't know john epps very well , do you ?
i want you to come with me .
the truth .
good luck . oh -- i would n't advertise what you 're looking for if i were you ...
what would you call it ?
sometimes i have serious doubts about you .
where is he ?
appreciate that .
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar . is this lieutenant dunbar ?
yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that 's her business .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
ah ... no one ... i give it to copper when he needs it ...
lynette , i told you already , it wo n't work .
they 're saying you killed that policeman .
not bad for eleven dollars a day .
what 's the other one ?
she understands .
have you ever tried any ?
rather disappointed at how poorly i taught you proper housekeeping . and quite well , it seems . thanks to you , son . thanks to you all .
it 's dr. meridian . chase . do you remember me ?
yo ' bleedin ' inside , man -- get that doctor .
why are we landing ?
what did they give you ?
you 're gon na have to repeat that , i think , buckaroo .
do you miss her ?
that i will indeed .
today , a good girl .
the nails ! ! watch the nails ! ! ... listen , you still have to eat .
well hell , buddy , do n't pull a long face ! this is still home for me ? i keep my room , and i 'll be back sooner or later ...
i know . i like it this way -- makes me look the way i feel .
it 's like you said , every man for himself .
where 's anna ?
what time do you get off ?

where the hell is air one ?
you wo n't be teaching this one either . she 's my wife .
do n't know .
tribuus ... tomorrow .
soft ! i will go along ; an if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
all right . speak to you then .
you know he 's never been anybody 's counselor before ?
there 's only one i want .
save the speeches for malcom x. i just wan na get laid .
you 're right . we should build a collection first .
i 'm on a break .
oh , no ?
all right , i guess .
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay-
what 's that , a gram ?
he do n't like popcorn .
it was covered with mr. fasil 's fingerprints , but none of his blood .
the first thing i learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let 's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you 're guilty , you know you 're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?
thanks . and what are -
two days .
sort of !
excuse me . i have something i 'd like to discuss with you .

it would only be , maybe , six months ? or three or four ? it would mean so much to him ...

to control the enterprise , they 'll have to gain access to one of two locations . main engineering ... or the bridge .
nothing .
most articles focus on the first half of her name -- describing some feline monster . i want the woman of catwoman . after all , if it was a man dressed as a cat , the story would be on page 23 -- just another loony . oh , i want this one . i want her bad..

wow . i 'm losing it .
i apologize if i seem forward -- but i must speak my mind . this promotion confirms that i have accomplished the goals i set for myself in my career . but it also casts into sharp relief that which i have not achieved . the thing all men most require : a marriage to a fine woman . you have become a fine woman , elizabeth .

jack , if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches , then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that . so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace , when it 's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom .
she 's not been here for a long time .
you hungry ?

spanish in florida called him juan caballo . john horse .

within no time , everything was set in place . we got rid of the freelance scamsters . the per was way up . the gods were happy , or as happy as the gods can ever be . and i , i decided to complicate my life . for a guy who likes sure things , i was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot .
here , you want some ?
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you 're afraid of the responsibility .
the financials are pretty thorough , so the only thing we do n't know is your fee .
there 's no need to be afraid , sire .
i 'm talking to you , tita !
you ran without us .
your aunt teresa is gay ? that beautiful , sensuous woman is a ... < u > lesbian < /u > ?

go back to the bus and reroute the call .
i 'm sorry . i am happy . i 'm very happy for you . i 'm glad you had a good time . it 's about time . where is he now ?
now that 's what i like to hear ! because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears . they give in to their feelings of self-doubt ... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs , alcohol and premarital sex . empty solutions . these are toxic chemicals ... and disease-spreading behaviour .
really ...
i 'm not convinced of that , mr. president , but your visit has raised my spirits ...
good night .
yes . for a whole year .
you leave that gun alone !
fuck you ! you think i want this ? that money 's a burden to me . every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back . i 'd give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father . but that 's life . and i deal with it . so do n't put that shit on me . you 're the one that 's afraid .
course it 's too bad about your dad .
you were a croupier there ? you never told me that . i thought you just knew some gamblers .
like a virgin with an ' urgin ' in a surgery i 'll be swinging -- i 'll be bringing out the nurse in me
mmmmnph ... i 'll get you a cab ...
goddamnit ! ! 911 is busy !

about you and li mu bai ?
you saved me , scully . as different and frustrating as it 's been sometimes , your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times ; have kept me honest and made me whole . i owe you so much , scully , and you owe me nothing . i do n't want to do this without you . i do n't know if i can . if i quit now , they win .
nobody said anything about hitting her ! you 're just going to take a few liberties with her .
then have a donut --
yul brynner . they 're all dead .
that 's perfect !
then i leave too .
yeah . but it was n't a group . it was one man .
yes , we 've been through death and life together .
i love you .
i always had chickens , ducks and whatnots .

mrs. robinson -- if you do n't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange . now i 'm sure that mr. robinson will be here any minute and --
yes ?
i am not a prickfuck , mkay ? you little asshole !
on an eighty-thousand dollar day ? and it ai n't even noon .
i do n't see anything about 'rewards and punishments ' or 'heaven and hell . ' this book reads like stereo instructions ! listen to this ... 'geographical and temporal perimeters ... functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation . ' this is going to take some time .
what happened to colonel brynner ?
unless i make her one of us ...
how did you know that ?
they point , i shoot .
i 've been in love with you for years . remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom ? and put your fingerprints on my lens .
a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see .
the front gate would be best , general .
call me later .
yes .
what 's that ?

you 're fucking psycho .
you can eat balanced meals , exercise , and take geritol .
brain injury .

with my little sparrow leading team .
cy ... cy ... oh shit man ... who did this to you . was it the pigs ?

the anonymous kind , chief .
well , i guess that 's all till tomorrow .
as commander in chief , i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack .
at least .
c'mon , frank . what are you doing ?
yeah , barely . we have n't found anything down here . nothing ...
what did i say about mentioning that bitch ?
he looks familiar . did he do a calvin klein ad ?
who you talkin ' to , studs ? me , or buddy . i ca n't tell , you got those shades on .
look , mush , you 're the guv'nor here , i can see that , i 'm on your manor now , right . so there 's no need to get out of your pram . i 'm johnny-come-lately to all this . whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine , it 's got nothing to do with me . i do n't wan na know .
excellent . that 's exactly what i had in mind . but if you 're going to kill me , we have to work together , old son . i 'm no pushover , you know .
what 's so funny ?
gim me a second here ... tidwell ... arizona contract ... new glass cabinet ...
why is that ?
hello , bernstein .
you think i 'm the white angel ?
my thumbs hurt . i 've made a mistake . i 've been negligent . i have n't exercised . i have to hitchhike a little bit every day , no matter what . it 's like a musician practicing his scales . when i do n't practice , my timing gets off , my thumbs get stiff and sore .
i ca n't lie here . i 've got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree .
notice the grain . see how deep and rich the red runs ?
i do n't know . it could be anywhere . we do n't even know if he was alone . please , caesar , we do n't have much time . let 's get out of here .
sure ! but we think it 's kickass ! now i get to be tony . i get to dump the glass of water on someone else 's head !
but then we knew that all along , did n't we ...
you are ?
but if you 're wrong ...
joe , you look absolutely divine . turn around !
hundreds .
time to impact ... ?
you do n't believe that .
kevlar second chance .
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the nelson 's . right , right . how midwest . i like that .
do you know the joke about the two swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time ?
no .
the speech is excellent . `` oh , then i see queen mab hath been with you ! '' excellent and a good length . but then he disappears for the length of a bible .
this is a totally barbaric custom .
yeah , but it 's my money , and i do n't need me a partner .
choices ? ? ?
you know him ?
please ...
she is an innocent .
no , not the end . the beginning . his son was just a little boy at the time , but the years passed , and when he grew up , he became a skier , too . one day last winter , he went out by himself for a run down the mountain . he gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock . just as he 's unwrapping his cheese sandwich , he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet . he bends down to take a closer look , and suddenly he feels that he 's looking into a mirror , that he 's looking at himself . there he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact , sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation . he gets down on all fours , looks right into the dead man 's face , and realizes that he 's looking at his father .
they like you -- -- -- - kids .
where is it - where 's my notice ? i 've got to finish it !
yeah . otis elwell . the columnist .
we 're going for a walk .
you would n't know her address , would you ?

paul , my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south .
someday he 'll surface and i 'll get him for both of you . i promise . i 'll find the guy with the scar .

i never comped you ? ! i do n't comp you at least two or three times a month at the tangiers ? !
i 'll go with you --
and i actually date you ?
you 're a bank robber ?
you 've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what 's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ?
well , we could --
uh ... we must never act like apes , son . for you see , the ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp . a single chromosome separates us . but you know what truly separates us from the apes , what makes us better than apes ?
you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you 're wrong , and you 're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it . we 're heading northeast .
you -- standards and practices ?
you are a master of understatement . they are likely to destroy the planet .
him ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable ... a smear on the drafting board .
from leon ! ... how is he ? ... come , tell us ... open it ... tell us ... how is he ?
for what ?
take care of him . he 's a very special man .
madonna .
the soul of the house . everything that 's corrupt about it ... my father trapped it in there just before he died . you see , he purchased the house to restore it ... we were going to live here ... nothing can live here . i was just a kid ... the first time i saw it , i thought it was beautiful ... it was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room ... then it started to move ... then death started to happen ... first the workers.. six in all ... then my father ...
`` a superhero 's job is to protect.. '' sorry , i ca n't take you seriously ... i overheard you say that tomorrow the cult of good will be dead -- i should be so lucky -- what did that mean ?

kay-em , you 've saved our lives , you know that do n't you ?
i myself was surprised at mr. de mille 's manners .
i ca n't hold up my head anymore .
he 's been shot a lot . he 's used to it .
naw , that 's some stupid shit . now you know how i got that name .
you , ya barrel of pork lard . here piggy piggy !
i know the territory .
yes , sir .
he 's recovering on the third floor .
seen you together , that 's all .
i 'll bet .
now that is an interesting proposition .
we 're tracking the cellular phone bill .
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once , sued me before i could bat an eyelash .
i kind of half expected you to thank me .
: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
i did -- and -- and i got right up .
really ?
so what 're you goin ' up there for .
hey ! on behalf of burnfield , i present to you the keys to the city .

not even if they 're a dork . you should go by and see how he 's feeling .
sorry , i did n't know .
... now who is that ... ?
but he has n't . he wandered off . i know it 's terrifying . i can imagine how you felt when that call came -- but it happens .
the alarms go off ...
what do you mean , no ?
you like spaghetti ?
jeb stuart , stonewall jackson , jefferson davis -- they 're all losers in my book .
no i 'll be ok. i 've got my mace . my knife . these two lethal weapons .
butch ! i 'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here ! now , you ca n't double-cross me ! ... she does ? all right -- put her on . i 'll talk to her ... hello ! oh , hello , madam ... now listen , you ten-cent glamour girl , you ca n't keep butch away from his duty ... what 's that ? you say that again and i 'll come over there and knock your eye out ! hello ? i 'll kill 'em ! i 'll kill both of 'em ! duffy ! mousing around with some big blonde annie on my time ! that 's co-operation ! duffy ! !
batgirl , baatgirl , baatgirl .
please prepare carefully . this could n't come at a better time .
a few days ago .

where are we going ?
women are always late . you 'll find out .
it did n't work out as planned . where are you off to ?
but i have to go , dear . it 's a very important banker 's meeting .
of course it smells like fish . we 're on the ocean . what 'd you expect , chanel number five ?
that 's very enlightened , professor . it 's comforting to know that america 's children have you for a teacher .

and all the angels are built like lieutenant dish .
my name 's kurtzweil . dr. alvin kurtzweil .

pretty good shot you are . what did she do ?
you could n't hang me in your bedroom -- i 'll make a note of it . where 's my secretary ?
nothing .
all i need is the radio frequency to track them .
he 's not hurt . he 's okay . look at him .
then they may read about me .
i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start . you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough . you sit right there with your no manners self .
erik the viking ! the things you seek are not in our power . we do n't make men love each other or hate each other .
what 's the matter , doris ? business bad ?
shane 's going as a condom .

i 'm babbling . good to have someone to talk to for a change ... but you need to go . take her out of here ... ... i do n't have long .
he better watch out or he 'll get aids when he date-rapes her .
yes .
not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand . it is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns .
victims of what ?
twenty years . too long . we were like a play whose run outlasted the cast 's ability to keep it fresh . so i finally decided to close down the show .
sixty .
he looks like he was designed by scientists . for desert warfare .

go catch jimmy , ray . really . he 's gettin ' away . go ahead , go get him . i 'm late .
what ?
that 's right ! dry cleaning -- remember the name . it 's going to revolutionize the laundry industry , and those that get in early are gon na bear the fruit away . all i need is $ 10,000 to open my first store , then i use its cash flow to finance another , and so on -- leap frog , bootstrap myself a whole chain . well , me and a partner . cleanliness , friend . there 's money in it . there 's a future . there 's room to grow ... say , that 's looking pretty good . let 's see it with the hairpiece on ...
bobby ? piece of advice ?
he was adopted you know .
i 've got more than a right as far as you 're concerned , susan .
at this hour ?
they 're here , they 're fine . in the dressing room . see you later --

yes . is molly there ?

you ca n't duck this , bill . i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i wo n't let this happen .
i 'm lonesome . i 'm lonesome so i 'm a drunk . i 'm lonesome so i 'm a dope fiend . i 'm lonesome so i 'm a thief , a fornicator , a whore-monger . poop , i say , poop ! i 've heard it all and i 'm sick of it , sick to death .
the insurance business ?
it gets interesting if it was haldeman , because our word is that when chapin says something , he 's gotten the ok from haldeman , and when haldeman says something , he 's gotten the ok from the president .
next time lets put some money on it .
ogg 's footprints !
seven and nine !
yengeese major give all property to magua . magua give yengeese major much wampum , many gifts , maybe three , four oxen .

then all we 've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we 're close enough to record it , we 're ashes ...
yeah ... um ... so anyway , tell me . what about you ? i 'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies .
you killed him ! come on with the rest of it . you killed him !
you 'd better get a new alarm clock . the chief has been hollering for you .
i hate it here . it 's so ugly , it 's like being dead . you got out of here , you know ? i 'm ready to go .
< u > what < /u > ? oh no ! better it was me . there is n't another good tomato within a hundred leagues .
she knows every neat junk food place .
lestat escaped the fire !
yours .
but they wo n't want to take you to trial . they 'll offer you simple possession , a few months of county time , and a year or two probation . how 'bout another ?
sounds like a good idea .
i thought we were helping .
that 's than un on christmas i was tellin ' you about .
so you can beat him ? so you can starve him ? a dog in the street would fare better with you !
this was a very difficult decision , because i have three wonderful sons . i mean , adrian , so smart , so ruthless . and cassius , so strong , so tough . and nicky , so ... so ...
you dig that rat out of the hole ?
but i 'm always afraid i 'll say something stupid .
yes , i am .
i had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so i could get some honey , and i did n't feel up to using any more magic just yet . anyway , i was in less danger than you 'll be in today .
ma'am , i 'm very sorry about your problems and i appreciate what your daughter must be going through , but i 'm afraid you 've misunderstood whatever it is you read . i do n't do that sort of thing .
how do you know ?
really ? but he 's been married for twenty years -- they 've got six kids .
ten hours straight . he 's a machine .
you 're not going after argon !
i 'm ... i 'm ... oh no ... i thought when i woke up ... i thought sleep would do it ...
yeah , but that was for love .
... yeah , go ahead .
you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you 're leaving tomorrow .
or you ran into something ... .
the only way to find out if a man 's trustworthy ...
oh my god , you kidding , me marry burke dennings do n't be silly , of course not .
this is not a joke . they know that we know about them . they 're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark !
no biggie , really .
are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl ? or are you gon na save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her ?
nothing 's wrong . they went to wellesley together .
what 's that ?
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom 's leg . he is going to go eat it .
you do n't want to kill him . if anything happens to him now you will be blamed ... and he knows it . besides , that gladiator school is a fortress . it would take the army to break in there . what you want is to ... offer him the wooden sword . if he takes it , he 's no longer the champion of the people , is he ? he 's gone . and you are a hero for awarding it .
you have no idea how boring my life here is . if it were n't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape , i would n't know what to do . i want to thank you for keeping me company . i do n't drink , i do n't smoke , i do n't read . i hate music . that only leaves good conversation . it will be a shame to lose you .
do you remember me getting sick ?
do n't make stuff up , these emotional theories , just so you can feel important here .
what was the nature of the argument ?
i swear , sometimes , you just want to hold onto somebody ! judy , what am i going to do ? i ca n't go home again .
what the hell are these ?
we 're gon na be the winning side . it 's like rothstein said about that guy in austria . we 're gon na use maranzano and masseria . let 'em knock each other bloody . and then , when everybody 's screamin ' for peace , we step in to make it . what they 're fight in ' over , everybody will beg us to take .
yes . i mean are you actually talking about this , or are we just ...
i do n't , no matter what my sisters say , ok ?
easy . slow is best .
whoa , why are we getting off ?
maybe . maybe with the crazy whites .
how ya doin ' dad ?
it was bad .
because i have to !
you do n't do anything , why are you being scared ?
nothing , nothing at all .

we ca n't touch hoover --
i 'm sorry . where were we ?
sure , i 'm on my way to a party at remington university .
i 'm not finished . under other circumstances i 'd gladly go out of my way . i do n't understand why you just do n't phone some other person .
no , nice ones worried that i was having a heart attack .
if it 's just the same to you , we 'll sit right here till they come . got a toothpick ?
no . after he was born , every time we started to make love , he would cry . he had an uncanny sense of timing . we really should n't do anything here anyway .

we can stop him .
amen to that . it 's been a crazy day , has n't it ? !
yes ?
what 's wrong with that ?
howdy stranger .

what do you mean `` basically '' ?
but these ... machines are what 's keeping him alive , is that right ?
-- well , let 's hear it for small miracles --
just do n't fall off any ladders .
when i want your advise , keegan , i 'll make an appointment .

i 'd keep that thing close just in case , if i were you ... i 've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion , but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side .

al .
it 'll be all right ...
yes , because someone was always keeping me awake . ever since i was little . that was my job . i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long , and she woke up all the time . and after she died , well , it 's been a few months , but i still , i still wake up , it 's ... a habit . i know we 've only known each other a couple of hours , but i 'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this . i 'm really happy to be here with you .

it 's simply that i find it incredible , mr. hillyer . aside from the girl 's illness at the moment , she is very strong , a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one , too . she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child , if only sporadically .
right . see how your story ends .
my disguise . and here ...
justin 's in the airlock .
whereas avi 's a zionist nazi .

do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ?
yeah . i 'm registered for this class .

are you serious ?
he did n't recognize me . back off , willya ? he did n't recognize me .
i sympathize with your position , mr. president , i know how difficult it is to be straightforward , the reaction to such a speech could be chaos .
cut it out , sam .
gee , that is a problem .
tell the president to adopt . i think i 'll like l.a .
eddie murphy .
well , they 'll go along with anything .
nobody stole my credit cards . they burned up in the crash . which reminds me , did you get me cash ? and what about the reservations ?

until she was twelve . she moved here in 'forty-nine .
they was a boy . we made friends .

they got a asshole over here . a asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there . a asshole perched up there . assholes everywhere . hey , maybe if we were doin ' that kiss , kiss , bang , bang stuff we 'd need all those assholes , too . what we 're about is intimacy . we 're about two people having a conversation . say i was interviewing you . all i want you to worry about is what i ask you . i want a trust to develop . if you 're thinking about all this ... ... you 're not going to relax , a trust wo n't develop , we 'll be talking a each other instead of to each other , there will be no chance for intimacy .

' it was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer . today it has a value of $ 100,000 . eh , bien -- i am not a thief . i knew there was some mistake . take them .
hey , i 've got a great compliment for you .
what the hey . let 's go for a drive .
it is n't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady . now he 's got them to cancel the fair .
one of them < u > is < /u > a cop .
be a gentleman . you have to help me down .
but how can you say that ?
no , thank you . goodnight .
sorry . it 's the first time i 've ridden `` piggy-back '' in years .
we can appeal , but i ca n't guarantee anything .
yeah . a couple . we 're outnumbered by the cows , though .
i think it started in the wind . money - arms , big oil , pentagon people , contractors , bankers , politicians like l.b.j . were committed to a war in southeast asia . as early as '61 they knew kennedy was going to change things ... he was not going to war in southeast asia . who knows ? probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - houston , new york - hell , maybe bonn , germany ... who knows , it 's international now .
you lost your control .
no . that 's ray here . ray ...
shivers and sweats and groans . his teeth chatter . what 'll we do ?
i do n't think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center .
that dillinger 's on to him .
shut up !
thank you , sir .
if the french army had been commanded at jena and auerstadt by a tailor , the king of prussia would certainly have gained the day .
yes . he 's a very careful driver .
or rather , bad news and good news , because he likes this person playing tonight . i mean , he liked laura too , i did n't mean that . and he likes you . it 's just that --
gabe are you alright ?
you really think so ... us ?
do n't leave me ...
no way .
get the grader . go out 29 past toby 's . do n't let lillian get to you . she did n't belong here . that 's why she left .
are you alright ?
bob , ca n't you get them to wait for us ? they 're leaving us farther behind every day .
might you have a birth certificate , mr. chance ?
let him do it ! go-go-go-go-go !
and so missoula 's prodigal son returns .
what were we saying ?
what ?
... the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death . and no doubt god 'll be pickin ' on you on judgement day ...
i did n't do it . i was in the frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up .
darling ! ... you will be careful ! ?
oh , hi cue ... carl . sorry .
sure . that 's great , ray . i think you should get down there right away and check it out . let me know what happens .
we 've got to move fast . this is an idea whose time has come .
but it 's funny ! it 's a practical joke . they 'll get frustrated !
you do n't say --
did you know i was an alcoholic ?
who ?
we 'd better be . i have n't spent a night out of brooklyn in fourteen years , and i 'm not about to break my record now . besides , i 've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning .
look , i 've got to talk to her . this is n't a contest we want the whole country entering .
thousand , yes , bones or clams or whatever you call them .
i thought you liked them . they liked you .
how was it ?
he was a president .
they 're *outrageous* , them rules !
we could do it now , we can go upstairs . ... please , it 's time for us . come upstairs .
make your mind easy , you shall not be left behind , i warrant you . do take a last look at your barracks , make your mind easy , say a farewell to your friends in berlin . the dear souls , how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country , and , out of it , you shall go .
i do n't think i should go home looking like this . you think i could stay at your place tonight ? your mother 's not there is she ?
that is simple , is n't it ? i assume you can prove that if necessary .
i told you .
there 's nothing in there about ruby .
does it please you to say such things ?
yes .
steady on .
to the pools ?
ah , well , i bought her this huge pumpkin for halloween , but she could n't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks , and it ended up under the christmas tree .
pretty near . what do you know about the outfit we 're going to ?
you brought a case ? good .
no .
why not , against your religion ?
did n't i tell you to knock before you came in here ?
i want out .
vegas ...
could be ... any of those dead kids wearin ' pearl earrings ?
i have to consider , i mean , as the mob guy , this is another man 's wife i 'm sleeping with .
ooohhhhhh no .
you know , m.j. , when i watch you shoot , i realize i 've got a little problem with my stance ... could you just move over here and critique my legs ?
but you 're an actor . i hear these hollywood guys have it delivered to the set .
-- ca n't seem to escape you today .
no . after you 've lived with < i > chimera < /i > for twenty hours , nothing can save you . not even ... < i > bellerophon. < /i >
you know , buddy , about this friendship thing ...
you 've got to trust me . i 'm putting my daughter 's life in your hands . she 's only six . she 's just a little girl . please , please , trust me .
no , i 'm hiding out .
some . but i mean we are n't all so ... handsome .
but you have to consider all possibilities , sandro .
yes .
you don抰 say .
when did you talk to lula ?
i got a file on him two inches thick . he 's a petty fraudster . this is something else . ever heard of someone called the puritan ?
why are they doing this ?
checked and locked , sir .
i think i know leon quite as well as you ... possibly a little better . leave that worry to me . five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier , but naturally you 'll be too busy for any farewells . i 'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport . that 's my proposition , comrade yakushova .
naw , i 'm got live ghetto fabulous . make sure you get that car fixed .
that 's what i 'd like to know . lost transmission at cable junction .
what do you mean `` brought it bowling '' ? i did n't rent it shoes . i 'm not buying it a fucking beer . he 's not gon na take your fucking turn , dude .
no ! spies or something . and harry from work ... get down !
i am father vogler . i am a chaplain here . i thought you might like to talk to someone .
i do n't know . i do n't know . this is n't happening .
you drive a hard bargain .
you kidding ? this is detroit . drink ?
okay , but come here first .
let me do it for you , mr. white .
oh ? there 's proof now ?
that 's just how my brain works , i guess .
what about his suit ? that 's a million five the company 's got to replace . they 'll make somebody go get it .
i 'm sure .
no -- i wanted to be a professional hockey player .
well what 's the point in that ?
i know .
forget it .
our people swear he wore surgeons ' gloves the whole time . they dusted everything .
but the damage report -- we were immobilized ...
who 's the deputy director of the f.b.i . ?
pretty cool bar .
when 's the latest time you were out there ?
look , uh ... i 've got to talk to helen about this thing with dana . i 'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch .
it 's a little late for that .
intuition . it does n't make you yoda . like tonight . you killed that guy tonight . but i knew you would .
let 's meet tonight , okay ?
it 's been awhile . i 'll take your word .
if she ca n't pay , i 'll have to foreclose , wo n't i ?

johana , am i boring you ?
yes sir .
oh please . another one .
he must have . he sent for the santa rosa police .
you scheduled a whole day with the first lady ?
do anything you want to me . i give myself to you . only put the knife down . is n't this what you always wanted ? i know it 's what we all want , to love and to loved . i could love you . you could work together in some safe place , learn to really understand you , help you , give you some peace of mind , some happiness ...
pardon me , but i doubt you can handle her . my wife was quite a martial arts expert . jade fox killed her . so you see , this is personal . leave her to me .
so you 're cloverleaf ?
ten years ago .
if you ask me , i think we should make that run to choo choo town and pick up that load of lumber . nice . easy . and within the law .
you sure ? maybe next week we could ...
curtis , it 's three in the morning . i 'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes .
on the train ?
but you would like to know where she is ?
am i free to go ?
tony ? this is keith fisher . you 're doing my wedding and i 'm calling about the chair situation . yeah , i 'll hold .
maude , do you pray ?
i 'm not doing it !
you wicked old witch ! uncle henry , auntie em , do n't let 'em take toto ! do n't let her take him -- please !
they 're not supposed to be here !
we lived near power lines .
it 's not talk ; i 'm doing it .
standing right here , man !
okay , i guess . it 's so intimidating . you know being away from home , not knowing anyone . i feel like such a geek sometimes . everyone 's so cool and i 'm so not .
i got ta get you out of here .
ernie , dump him in a cab . around the corner . tiffany , you help him . i 'll destroy his file and refund his money . and if anybody comes asking ... we 've never heard of douglas quaid .
you stay out of this , bob .

yo , paulie .
what makes you think i wo n't turn us around ?
we have to get out of here ! !
a pass .
he asked me again about you and the jew 's wife .
he died of a massive rupture .
you were right about the telephones . there are no lines , there 's some problem .

hell , i 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -

please , we need your help . the morlocks have taken --
you know i burned all his shit . all that vinyl . chalamar , funkadelic , i burned his turntables too . they was like three-thousand brand new .
well , son , i 'm glad to see a stone come up in the world again .
last hand .

we 're not going out two days before we set the record , it 's not gon na happen .
you were born old ...
is she ?
you were wearing your belt .
contemplate your ... panic button .
you understand you 'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the , er ... ... scent .
oh yeah . there was , uh , somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio , and , uh , we got this telephone call , this guy is making a sound effects record , and he 'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream .
m'god , i look twenty years old . you have any weird dreams last night ?
i do n't care ! i ai n't no freakin monument to justice ! i lost my hand , i lost my bride ! johnny has his hand , johnny has his bride ! you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget ?
... it adds up buddy , 300 here , 200 there . your brother never ... ... well , i always said money is something you need in case you do n't die tomorrow ...
i do n't know .
you really want to know ?
lorenzo saint dubois . but everybody calls me lsd .
why 're you crying ?
for mother 's day , i used all my allowance that i 'd been saving to take my mother to kansas city . we got our nails done and had lunch at `` skies , '' a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city . it was the last outing we took together . she died the following year .
what ?
thanks . it does , the more you know who you are ... you do n't care about things the same way ...
like you do n't give her a hard time .
it 's everything we wanted . a very good read . a terrific piece of work . so , here 's to you and suez .
but i -- well , you see , sir , i met mrs. marsh and told her .
no -- real food .
bianca did what ?
best everything , joe . but i 'm going to dance with you .
johana cross , pleased to meet you . well ! is n't this a coincidence . i really was n't expecting this ... all the way out here . it 's incredible !
hi .
who ... who breaks out ?
not until ben is back inside !
find a lawyer ?
two legs , nice rack ...
ed , how 're you holding up ?
for a minute , doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong .
gosh , i loved that show . watched it for years .
then what 's your goddam opinion ?
robert ? i ...
now then , mrs. kramer , you said you were married seven years . is that correct ?
how did you get off the island ?
is this a needlepoint club ? is it about you and me ?
i call 'em wiggers .
i said you 're soft .
and ?
why do n't we say we were together ?
not a word . he was going to check on the railroad station , and the trunk . he must be still on it .
it 's always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i 'd better ... take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
they 're okay and it 's worth it . ai n't it ?
i guess so . well , while you 're up there , maybe you could tidy the place up a bit .
fine , fine . big doing up here . why are you still down here ?
elvis is fuckin ' dead , man . get yourself some cds .
immediately .
are you all right ?
oh , i 'll teach you how to surf even if you do n't get the gig .
you thought , willa , that the moment you walked in that door i 'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night . ai n't that right , now ?
great . can i have it then ?
he 's not sorry , okay , fine . why do n't we see what we find out from the blood work ? i 'll work on getting a specimen , i 'm sure hospital food could help in that direction . maybe , by then , we 'll hear from my doctor , and we 'll go from there . okay ? everybody happy ?
it 's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv .
aaach ... jane ... let 's take the part that has nothing to do with me . let 's let me be your most trusted friend , the one that gets to say awful things to you . you know ?
nothing .
bela , i 've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight .
you mean you blew it .
is he all right ?
yes , it is .
i was one member of the investigating commission .
come on , jim . i 'm serious . dot ... dash . it 'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it .
dr. lecter ...
cactus , sometimes you do n't deserve to wear our logo .
yes . i did n't mean to sleep so long . i was afraid i 'd have an accident last night , from sleepiness ... so i decided to pull over ...
that 's her .
adamant .
no way .
i told you -- keep away . i do n't know what we do now .
you know what for .
ruiz is n't here .
i 'm free . i can never thank you enough .
me ? you went crazy ! you started taking your clothes off . i was putting them back on for you .
well i 've got something for you . in london , i mean . i 've been chatting to some friends . do you know the golden lion casino ? it 's in bayswater , i believe ... they 're looking for a dealer , a croupier .
father -- oh .
so what ?
what do you think i should get ?
yes .
that 's not possible .
but my uncle al , on my father 's side , he wo n't eat her stuffing , he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey . so my mother told my aunt ellen . . . aunt ellen 's my father 's half-sister , i told you that , right ?
we inspected the body , marquis . she died a virgin .
i wo n't kill again . hunt people . i gave that up . anything else ? it 's yours .
ah , mr. van orton . here you go ...
you 're thinking of things best not thought of , louis .
-- and as soon as we lose a game , he 'll be back in your arms .
hong kong ? i 'm not in hong kong . i 'm in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine , two minutes from the station . how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner ?
that means the nanobot is still inside him .
whoa - give me a chance !
what 's the dope , sheriff ?
of course . that 's the point . `` i 'm just happy to be here and hope i can help the ballclub . ''
yeah . rogue . picks out an area where there 's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts ?
do you know who was brought in for questioning ?
he wants to step into my shoes ! he wants to step into my shoes !
it 's succeeding !
we 've always known that to survive , we had to remain apart . it has n't been easy . many of the young people here want to know more about the offland ... they 're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life ...
we are a very modest and deeply religious people , mr denham .
first let 's see what happens if we play it cool .
... overdrawn bank accounts .
they will if they catch him in the act . you can make that happen , dad . you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment .
that 's what everybody says .
something about my father ?
yeah ... ... yeah ... ..
me .
i mean , some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered .
-- maybe she 'll come with us . if i tell her how important it is to me , i do n't think she 'll mind . do you ?
he will learn patience .
has he eaten anything at all ?
thanks for the break . bandit , this here 's the dixie chicken .
where ?
no , do n't -- that 's something . nothing is nothing . do n't even look at me . i want ...
kelly . what is it ?
i 'm calling the police . right now .
annie , some day you 're going to get us all in deep trouble .
it 's a secret .
hope you never do . at first it feels like a sauna , by the time you hit victim four it 's a fucking burning shirt factory .
well that hardly sounds like you ...
i killed him ... and cut him and ate all of him ... i left nothing for you !
what do you want me to say ?
what抯 going on with you two ?
lady , i got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and i could enjoy this family restaurant !
no .
weil great . you can watch tv upstairs .
sound !
you did n't have to tell me if you did n't want to .
paulie , you 've got kids , right ?
you do ?
you might say i 've always been one of mr. valentin 's biggest followers .
what do you want to do , scott ?
no matter . i do n't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes . by then cloverleaf will own toontown quite legally .
i do n't understand .
and my hair ... what color hair did barbara have ?
o-o-o-okay , lee . okay , okay . you , you , y-you 've said enough . it 's my responsibility now . i will work things out .
chief says -- he has a god .
listen , in two days i 'm embarking on a tour of the western territories . and i want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence .
sure , great if you ai n't married .
of course .
it 's okay . he 's admiring the shape of your skull .
this is bad , joe . the prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists . they 'll argue exactly the opposite . they 'll say he 's just pretending to be catatonic and he 's completely sane .
congratulations . by crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet , you 've become the third white man ever to hear of it .
no , a year of partying is enough . she 'll be going to harvard this fall .
what 's keeping you ?
hey , is that `` old dog tray '' ? sounds like `` old dog tray '' .
what 's that ?
i do n't know who you insult more ; her or me .
what ?
it 's just -- the pain . it 's only getting worse . i ca n't be a good wife . i ca n't be a good mother .
danny ...
a little mushy ! you think the taxpayers would like it , utah , if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls ?
they stopped serving two hours ago .
fill it out . standard issue mal- practice insurance . all cops carry it .
let 's get back to work , and maybe we < u > will < /u > be , soon .
oh --
and , is that a pitchfork beside him ?
... little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party ... city council ... ? what 's the trouble ... ?
strokin ' . here goes nothin ' .
i do n't understand what we 're doing .
oh really ? i did n't know that .
i think you 're overreacting .
mid-town mostly .
i 've got to think of emily -

no ! they g-got the wrong guy ! i saw it ! the killer was n't chinese .
leads a young man-john-into the dining room .
it would n't be a lodge without hats .

goodbye , darling .
you know i 'm going to be twenty-five in june ?
i ... i 'll get the grits .

druggist supplies . buster here is gon na get an award . no , he sold seventeen thousand bucks ' worth of stuff last month . fastest boy in the territory .
are you ok ?
i 'm just too old for going steady , josh .
do you know when you 'll be back ?
indy ?
look more closely .
your partners are currently armed and we 're not . our edge is that they do n't know we 're in touch .
i dunno -- i ca n't figure it out . i 've invited them all . why do n't they come ?
$ 10,000 ! i do n't know what to do , ed . i do n't know what i *can* do . even though i know who the sonofabitch is .
goddamn ! how long have we had this fucking dog ? ! two years , he still does n't come ! we need a dog that looks happy when the press is around .
what 's the use .
no . i 'd have liked to .
what the hell kinda cop are you ? !
oh . well , when , then ?

i 've only shown this to three other people . i bought 200 , we 've launched 12 so far . i keep the coordinates in this room . it 's left over from sdi . reagan 's star wars technology ? they orbit 426 miles up .
are you < u > done < /u > ?
the acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear , the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret . you understand that do n't you ?
did i ever tell you , i hate costume parties ?
... i was just talking to that girl in the other room .
uh ... i thought you might know a trick or something . to make her , you know ...
harvey . you need me . since you 've gotten out of arkham , you 've managed , what ? to bungle stealing a safe ? wreck a statue ? and , correct me if i 'm wrong here , but were n't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus ?
i thought we talked about that .
you wo n't find it because no such telegram exists .
no women . not in boodles . not since 1922 .
oh .
the smoke 'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out . let it run .
your visa has expired . be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported .
no , you fucked you ! do n't invert stuff ! big tobacco tried to smear wigand ; you bought it . the wall street journal , here , not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment , refutes big tobacco 's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination ! and now , even now , when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed , the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi , the cat totally out of the bag , you 're still standing here debating ! don , what the hell else ... do you need ?
i do n't .
i think so , why ?
you could have them here by daybreak .
hah ! ! ! those cagey rascals ! those sly dissemblers ! those , uh ... they 've finally pulled the wool over everybody 's eyes !
something 's wrong . i know it . i 've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg .

'' out of what ? cold calling . nothing . sixty-five , when we were there , with glen ross farms ? you call 'em downtown . what was that ? luck ? that was `` luck '' ? bullshit , john . you 're burning my ass , i ca n't get a fucking lead ... you think that was luck . my stats for those years ? bullshit ... over that period of time ... ? bullshit . it was n't luck . it was skill . you want to throw that away , john ... ? you want to throw that away ?

examination and interview materials are confidential . we 've never violated an applicant 's trust , and we never will .
you 're a danger to both the dead and the living .
what do you mean ?
well , how the heck are ya ?
you got a place to stay ?
no biggie .
stay back .
... been right , but who knows ?
it 's a bug .

-- this is serious business down here and we can not have people coming and going --
i do n't know . there 's a lot of space up here . they could be just about --
i did n't do anything .
i 'm not hungry .
i want to speak to you alone . i saw something . i heard .
positive , sir .
how could you have done that ?
i want to talk to a goddam lawyer .
what do you say , hoffy . we 'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of barracks nine .
yes . initially .

and how hard it hit ?
the baseball is mine .
i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life .

for what ?
i 'm so sorry .
hand me the phone .
in his name ? ?
that 's fine ! that 's fine ! now fall right into their laps . go ahead . say john doe walked in and called the whole thing off . you know what that 's going to sound like on top of this !
well your thinking 's not so good .
do n't give it another thought , one of destiny 's many pranks . after all , you did n't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank ...
but i found the money .
viridian ?
i told him about your work , and he 's very excited .
what ?
what 'd you bit me for ! !
he 's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink .
well the neighborhood is full of dogs , and it 's not always otis .
of course , who can nowadays ? i have trouble writing a post card to my children ! look , we could give you a six figure advance , provide you with the very best ghostwriter , research assistants , proof readers ...
thank you , mr. bates .
so i 'll see you at the rehearsal .
dilophosaurus .
oh yeah , what 's that ?
a friend ?
no , i think your mother , her illness --
i was leaning way over , to see the ... ah ... propellers . and i slipped and i would have gone overboard ... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself .
me , too . ca n't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the guardhouse . have we fed them ? like raw steak or something ?
i know that , sir . ma'am . it 's just that ... beggin ' your pardon , senator , but ... do you understand that this involves combat training ?
she had this shiny black hair piled up on her head , but later on she let it hang loose and i 'll be damned if it did n't come all the way down to her ass .
ah , no , no . i did n't bang her . i know her from around here , that 's all . you want to meet her or what ?
it will take the entire day , but he will begin to doubt himself . he will begin to believe that he missed me , that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe .
now what can you want with me , erik the `` viking '' ?
it 's still impressive by my standards : my name 's john .
sad ? what made you sad ?
as i 've said we had some more ...
you got me out of my hotel room . you came and got me out of my room .
no . but you 're in very big trouble .
we still have some extra ones , do n't we ? maybe we can just --

no . missing teenager . disappeared thirty years ago . found her bones last week . buried behind some old diner , up by dyckman street . mary finelli .

lieutenant toejam , why do n't you help him ?
not particularly .
no , i think you were . come on , admit it .
i do n't know . i can assume ...
it 's not cheating ... it 's charity . bloom , look at me ... look at me ! i 'm drowning . other men sail through life . bialystock has struck a reef . bloom , i 'm going under . i am being sunk by a society that demands success , when all i can offer is failure . bloom , i 'm reaching out to you . do n't send me to jail . help ! help !
why do you think they call him jangle leg ?
more proof god 's a guy ...
and annette 's it for you ?
i 'm moved beyond words .
the baby ?

c'mere , nanook .
i wish there was one i wanted .
if that ai n't the truth . and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat ... thank you , fred .
quick , everyone to the lab .
oh , yeah . this could be bigger than the microchip . they 'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us . we 're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady .
how 'd you get in here ?
an invitation ?
you 're too young to understand .
honey , the meeting today is going to be fine . do n't get in an uproar .
r-u-s-h intensely .
otho , i can < u > not < /u > < u > live < /u > with these cheap domestic floor tiles .
here , here , a thousand us dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family . to let us drive off to the mille collines .
she did n't give you my address ?
uh ...
it is n't a broadcast studio . it 's -- a surveillance post or something . that 's why they have the dishes on top .
not without massive sequence gaps !
yes .
not very encouraging .
got lost in his own museum , huh ?
what show ? would you mind telling me what 's coming off here ?
the night i left your house , i was lost . i was looking for directions .
i know it 's warm ... i wish you 'd call someone to check out the air conditioning , ken .
yeah . i 'm not trying to replace your dad ... or steal your mom . i just want to be your friend .
hey , sorry ... he 's my friend , too . and that ticket is not going to waste .
what is it ?
uh , the accounting subdirectory in the gibson is working really hard . we got one person online , the workload is enough for like ten users . i think we 've got a hacker .
up there ! it is up there !
no , i did n't . i confiscated it . there 's a difference .
he just likes to write code . he 's bummed there 's so much secrecy and competition , everybody trying to own everything .
have you no respect for the dead ?
we never thanked him for giving us our special needs class .
only what you take with you .
everything go all right ?
you do n't want to jeopardize that reduction , do you , cole ? have it taken away ?
i know . mr. eichelberger -- in the mortgage loan department -- last night he had a little halloween party here --
not if i can help it . you got any information for me ?
i hear ya . play .
goddamn . will somebody please tell me why i smoke these damn things ?
is everything okay at work ?
we have n't any chips , mr. brett -- do you mind playing with cash ?
you 're lucky no one was hurt .
take a look at this . chet and i found it under teresa banks ' ring fingernail .
you should n't have brought me here ... it 's dangerous .
any day .
does it work on cash machines ?
sam ! ! !
they are mature humpbacks , weighing 45,000 pounds each . they wandered into san francisco bay as calves and were brought here . we call them george and gracie .
it 's beautiful .

we could do that . i could be on my way to florida , and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out .
bottle .
sonny ? do n't send me away ! i can help you save your soul ...
millions of people around the world get on busses every day . when was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus ?
it did n't feel that way .
can we find her ?
i mean , who runs interdiction on the mexico side ?
yeah , chili . hi . you 're fifty feet in the air !
why not , larry ? we could get a positive confirmation that way .
then why have n't you detected any signals ? if , as you claim , there have been thousands , millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why has n't one signal gotten through ? it 'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through ; you 're welcome to stay until then .
it was paradise , michael . you showed it to me . you were there .
back to copacabana . but eve . margo , let me tell you about eve-
we have our new army . dr. yueh , put the weirding module on him .

mr. duke , how can you claim that jason voorhees is not truly dead ?

big ringo fan .
sooner or later you 're gon na run out of things to change . you always do .
i 'm not saying i hate sick people or anything but i hate being < u > around < /u > them if you know what i mean . there < u > you < /u > go , you < u > inspire < /u > this kid to < u > live < /u > . i probably woulda vomited on him .
i guess you lost some hogs to the fever .

well , if you owe me , git your ass in the trunk .
i opened marlon . i think it 's somebody 's taxes .
ya set for , uh , ya know -- money ?
and that was the last time you saw him ?
are you okay ? i wish i had n't told you what i did . but i ca n't help the way i feel . you do n't hold that against me , do you ?
you really are stupid , you know that .
i know where we could get the money . a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars .
if i think of myself it 's because you never think of me . never . never . never ...
my place is n't like yours , nell , it does n't have a view of sea . it does n't have a view of anything . what 's interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls . living with me ... my boundaries are n't very well defined , nell . do you know what i mean ?
what if the japanese did invade ?
yeah .
thanks . i 'm obliged to ya , but i got ta get goin ' .

mr. costello handles our business with the government agencies .
i got beers in my room .

thank you .
that 's why i think it 's time for us to --
in the end , the jury saw it my way .
do n't be foolish . if it 's true , they 'll have to accept it .
but , you 're in love with someone who does n't exist . you come here , you meet this guy , who should laugh in your face , and instead you leave with him ! betty , you are one-of-a-kind ...
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back .
check with the state . if he 's never killed outside of washington the f.b.i . would n't have it . nolan ?
why do n't you ask for another one ?
guess so ...
you know what i 'm talking about . what did you use , a fire cracker ? a cherry bomb ?
well , you see , that 's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
it went to the goddamn fbi and they did n't find a goddamn thing . it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could 've taken off oswald at the morgue . there 's no chain of evidence , bill . and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository ? one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser , described by deputy weitzman ... maybe , just maybe , lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill - `` a patsy '' . take it at face value . lou , susie , i 'm going with my gut here . he 's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle , `` o.h . lee '' to rent the room , right ? what 's in a name , right ? in intelligence , they 're assumed to be fake . a name is sort of like a postbox number , a code - several different people can use the same name , right ? then why ca n't somebody be using oswald 's name ?
it 's sue ann rogers , betty sizemore 's friend ? i heard from her .
she was ... she was on the bed . she was just sitting on the bed .
want to what ?
well , that 's ridiculous . if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order , just pick up a phone and pay for a call .
mr. juarez ?
hold on ! hold on ! reach up !
i do n't care about the money . i just want to work again . you do n't know what it means to know that you want me .
okay , okay . listen :
yeah ?

oh , comedian . yes . oh , uh ... you 're on next .
what i asked you earlier ?
what is it ?
yeah . she 's sleeping now , i mean --
i think ... it ... works .
if you 're home it means either jack and bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you , or --
i know he does .

ben --
i 'm undercover . i had no choice . you have to trust me .

chess is a reflection of life . life is violent . the strong win . the weak perish .
i do n't believe we have the luxury of choice .
... umm ... listen , i 'm sorry ... you had to sacrifice your entire vacation .
can we get this car there ?
i do n't know . there 's some tension between us . i 'd hate to expose you to that .
see the blood ? pack of wolves took down a moose . greedy , gut-ripping sons of bitches . i 'd kill the last wolf on earth , right in front of the president of the u.s. stinking , cowardly predator , the wolf .
her master 's voice ! i must go now -- goodbye -- thanks .
oh , some insurance man . are you in ?
that 's ok .
all right , all right . jesse james never yelled at folk ...
nope- my father died before i was born . my mother died in childbirth . el1ie was my only blood relation . so she brought me here ... the day after i was born .
well , thank you ... ?
yup . the whole rig . i do n't care much about the rest , but i surely will miss that bay . least they did n't kill me . that was right considerate , i thought . they were laughing when they left me . thought it was real funny . i walked for a little while but there was no use , so i gave it up . figured it was just bad luck .
sid fletcher .
how ya think , it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch .
right !
mmmmm .

no , she was not as beautiful .
they 'll shoot you ; the fucking cops 'll shoot you ... they do n't give a damn . in spite of that bank insurance . you see what they did in attica , they shot everybody , the hostages , prisoners , cops , guards , forty-two people they killed , the innocent with the guilty .
he 'll find us , wo n't he ?

`` there once was a man named cobb , who kept semple away from the mob . came the turn of the tide and semple - he died - and now poor cobb 's out of a job ! ''
papa , the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room .

so ? that 's logical . you see , both being gardeners , they spoke about you to one another .
you heard me . why did you go out to the institute looking for her ?
how old am i ?
so ray and claude got their pardons , right ?

christ . how many tunnels lead off the island ?
do n't be pessimistic . it 's not your style . okay ... here i goes ... clearly a mistake . i have this -- what ? ailment ... and my doctor -- a shrink ... who i used to see all the time ... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help . i hate pills . very dangerous things , pills . `` hate , '' i am using the word `` hate '' about pills . my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you 'd never -- well , you were there , you know ... the next morning i started taking these pills .
romeo .
i ca n't take you to my place .
from my perspective , what 's been going on and what i 've been doing is ridiculous . it 's half-measures .
yeah , i have , i have , yeah .

it 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct .
sir , you have no call to get snippy with me . i 'm just doin ' my job here .
you 're welcome . it 's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor 's swing set .

i 've still got a few teeth in my head , mr. gittes , and a few friends in town .
you got ta plan these things .
any time .

do you have brothers or sisters ?
m-o-n-y -- i 'm right ! that 's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building , bet you could see it from here . m-o-n-y .
i leave in a week - the picture 's all wrapped up , we previewed last night ... those previews . like opening out of town , but terrifying . there 's nothing you can do , you 're trapped , you 're in a tin can-
get the readers ' department and see what they have on bases loaded .
that 's what *i'd* come here for . i 'd watch the movie .
let 's keep it that way .
it 's friday ... .
we do n't have anything else to try , sir .
actually we 're in italy , snickers , she said as if it made a difference .
ah , yes , you 're the new boy from next door , ha ha ! my name 's lime . harvey lime . welcome to expediting .
thank you for coming . i 'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly .
it 's a tachyon chamber . it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time . there are other worlds , daniel , other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
bullshit ! prove it .
vincent ...
that'swhati'mtalkin '' bout . that'swhati'mtalkin '' bout ! he 's off the hiz-hook !
cool . what 'd it do to you guys ?
he 's cute .

i can appreciate that .
there 's a nice boy .
oxygen is not the problem .
yes . well ... yes .
she 's far from `` fine . ''
me too .
but i ca n't be sure . i do n't even know who he is . he 's too insulated . too many layers around him .
it 's dark .
no point in arguing anymore ...
being gale weathers . what the hell are you doing ?
well , nothing .
yeah , but what happened after she drove off with glenn ?
can you make a copy we can show on our computers ?
what 's goin ' on ?
those scumsuckers are my radials , pham !
i ca n't .
you tore it again !
you should , will . god 's terrific ! he dropped a church roof on thirty- four of his worshippers in texas last wednesday night . just as they were groveling to him and singing a hymn . do n't you think that felt good ? he would n't begrudge you two measly murders .
think there 's any truth to what he was saying about those girls ? is that still going on ?
speaking of which , i want you also to get us tickets for the opera ...
party 's gon na need more than a couple bucks now .
i guess so . then what happened ?
that 's your definition of `` hard ? ''
i already know you think you 're worthless . i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light , for what you believe you are is what you become . i have n't been involved in anything like this for many years .
then it could all come out , sooner or later . nobody should be in on this . just you and me . or , more correctly , i .
no , it is n't . i 'm hungry and梐nd scared .
do n't need it . i remember everything .
ippolito ! get back here !
i 'm with another woman now . we 're both with the post office , midtown , 34th street branch .
yes , in theory , i suppose that would work .
do you want i send it to your room ?
she giving you any carfare for the ride ?
the vine -- the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall ...
mother ?
ehh , your part 's a little different . you 're like the god that looks down on all the characters , and oversees everything .
alex , what is it ?
it 's no big deal .
if you want to come up a minute , i 'll show you some pictures .
oh now , you put up a good fight . let 's change the subject . where do people who live in oasisburg go to get away from it all ?
i 'd like to get an order of ... um ... peanut butter .
you 're practically naked !
pull the other one , why do n't you ! we made a deal !
s'hotter inside than it is < u > outside < /u > ... even with the air conditioning .
you do n't need me ...
bear with me here ...
their asses are here , but their fuckin ' heads are still in sicily .
investigator rimgale .
yeah , there 's a pair'a broads i 'm thinking might be good for this .
that dude was torn limb from limb . no way a woman like that could have done it . you never seen blood on a chick 's sheets from her period ?
that 's right , fink , he lives next door to you .
ian ?

'cause as much as i love ya , you 're not exactly don corleone . what would he be losing ? a thirty- five year old delivery boy ?
afterwards they 'll make the decision as to whether or not they 'd like to continue their religious studies in israel . because , hey , after all we 'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing , sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism .

where do you think he got it ? mental illness is heriditary . who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother ? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance .
well , get him something else and let 's get out of here in one piece . get him a half of a 28-year old girl .

well , those guys share everything , right ?
did you drive up from san francisco ?
but i 'm not joking .
you see , he 'd been very clever . everybody , even our astute friend guild , thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer . but our hero had just one weak link in his chain . the telegrams , wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant . so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case . mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is . mimi , who was it that told you to say you 'd seen wynant ?
what was the file name ?
i would expect he does .
nothing ... you should n't have given victoria that guinness .

that 's why you bombed the building . the infected firemen , the boy --
i have an apartment . i do n't remember exactly where . my dog knows , though .
we are falling back on all fronts . our soldiers are retreating .
cheerful news to greet the morn .
... at twenty-thirty hours .
come off -- come off right . i 'm on my way in . you go free , i 'm engaging .
what about howard ?
matthew , look at him . when i lived in roxbury , the media followed this man everywhere . he was bigger than ten movie stars . where 's your white lincoln limo ?

oh . oh , god . of course , dave , how are you ?
ever since then - numb - no feelings . like my heart was shot full of novocaine .
the corleone family controls two major hotels in vegas ; one in reno . the licenses were grandfathered in , so you had no difficulties with the gaming commission . but i have the idea from sources ... ... that you 're planning to move in on the tropicana . in another week or so you 'll move klingman out , which leaves you with only one technicality . the license , which is now in klingman 's name .
you sound like a man with a couple of kids .
sounds like a threat .
you could just leave him .
he was afraid of himself . he tried suicide once . he was ill. manic depressive . he had wild emotional highs and lows . not a happy affliction for a scientist . he 'd been revered in our community . by the end he was a joke .
... coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that ... and ...
i know it 's a littler late for an apology .
my , my , my , how did things turn so hostile so quickly ? if i did n't know better , i 'd say you two were out to get me .
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want . i 'll be long gone . besides , who 's going to believe you ? you 're just a two-bit crook .
who said we were terrorists ?
you 're worried for my safety . i 'm touched .

gov , want to leave me that one . how come he got to play with this one , anyway .
why ? what is it ? why did you make me wait out here ?
it 's not a very big army . and small as it is you wo n't be able to continue feeding it for very long . we 've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on ...
so , l-l-l-listen , i te- i te- i tell you - can i call you back in a few minutes ?
it 's our job , gloria .
that 's not my handwriting .
i ca n't believe i let him stay in my house . right under my nose . that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i did n't see him .

cynthia ... what 's going on ?

you may discuss my predicament , doctor . you may discuss it with anyone you like , but not with me . i 'm not interested . i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian .
you 've been with gray again .

i have no choice , i ...
i 'm sorry , but that 's how it 's got to be .
then listen to me . you 're both disgusting -- with your pride , your pride . i hate you for coming here -- like a federal marshal in a western film . i loved you when you stayed away . but here you are now -- high noon in the superbowl ! you fool , you fool .
understand what ?
after torpedo room : report !
you 're insane , jeffrey .
queer ?
we 've heard lots about you .

i did n't teach you that .
what am i supposed to do ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
haven 's not going to talk to me .
the hell you say . this is n't just about you any more .

that 's it ... spice mining ... no other cloud quite like it . see the spotters over it ? they 're watching for wormsign ... the telltale sand waves . seismic probes on the surface , too sire ... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show ... looks like a good patch of spice .
i know .
and when was the last time she put herself out for you ? look , john , whatever she says to you now , in the end you 're still a servant .

you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived . what do you think i 'm doing ?
no comment ? ! are you kidding me ? ! i 've never seen someone 's image change so ... so drastically !
stop pressuring me ...
this is all too familiar .
my embarrassing admission is i really like that you 're nice . right now , anyway . i ca n't tell from one moment to the next what i 'm going to like . but right now i 'm glad you said , `` that 's okay '' to me . that was nice of you .
so ?
back on earth . victor 's medical facility ... we 're in quarantine .
you talked about it ?
in which part of me did this knowledge reside ? in these hands ? in this mind ? in this heart ? and reading and speaking . not things learned ... so much as things remembered .
is that you , roby ?
in this rat race , everybody 's guilty till they 're proved innocent ! one of the differences between the theater and civilization ... ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance !

with all respect , padrino . diego is my partner . i do not do business without him .
they 'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch . that 'll help .
first times are always wacked . just be glad you did n't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car .
ohh !
and that is how you talk to a girl , rat . voila . you ca n't miss .
where 's the baby ? ?

the need to know is clear . what did adam tell lois ? that 's the name of the game . what did adam tell lois ? what does lois know ?

master , bruce ?
and here i am ...
if there is , develop it !
of course ! that is why i placed myself here , with you , knowing yero would pull this crap .

joyce , give the assistant chief inspector a drink , would you ?

there was supposed to be a turn off . did i miss it ?
nels reporting in . sit down where you are . arms folded .
major , i happen to believe in a life after this one , so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done . i think i can .

i do n't know anything , i tell you . there 's been an accident .
good point . i do n't know what you 're talking about , but good point .
there 's no transportation anyway this time of night .

uh , huh ... she said she had a good job , was playing a lot of tennis . she wanted to know all about billy .
just hold on !
she was crushed . feel her skin -- it 's like sandpaper .
you fucking ass-holes .
lots of people ...
what is this going to cost ?
i know this may be difficult for you , but it 's for the best .
i 'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon . there we can sit ... side-by- side ... before the fire .
they 're watching us now .
that 's good . you never would have recognized me , huh ? check out the suit ! looking good , no ? you know i 'm the world champion ?

gee . you really think ?
what do you want me to do ?
of course not . he would n't be .
i 'll remove him .
sure . it 's the right size and everything . i even saw its phalanges today ! check this ...
exactly what john hammond wanted us to do .
he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf , but , his bite is worse than his bark , is n't that so , old fellow ?

thanks , pal . you saved my life .
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who 's who , what was said , what 's happening . i contacted your local coroner , and he found it taped to his back .
adam , that 's not true !
... let 's see the pigs , please .
there is no us , you psychotic bitch .
what 's the matter ?
professor ? professor brown ?
sweetheart , you can get a whole big bunch .
yes i do , i really do .
but she 's not dead , wes .
get the hell outta here !
that 's true ... wars are n't won with terrorism , neither wars nor revolutions . terrorism is a beginning but afterward , all the people must act ... this is the reason for the strike , and its necessity : to mobilize all algerians , count them and measure their strength ...
understood .
oh please sod off .
yeah , i 'm not so sure .
no .
what use is my sword ? i ca n't reach her !
it 's happening tomorrow morning . get back here now .
everything can be killed .
... to record how much we love each other . sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world . and she would like to say something .
well , this is going to sound a little crazy .
one of the seven natural wonders of the world .
well , there 's a pirate in truth , i have not written a word .
we 'll need a search running .
long time .
get them together .
i was sorry to hear about your wife .
less than you would guess . most days two to three assistant d.a. 's . a handful of police investigators .
i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .
the creatures ? they attacked you ? they tried to possess you ?
the hell it is n't , when somebody wires up enough c-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist ! that slag was on something , and not sour milk , either ? am i right ? tell me ! what is it ?
well , i would n't mind a quick chat , if you got the time .
uh-huh . mi raccomando . [ italian- american slang for 'i 'm counting on you ' ]
you mean he 's polymerized , like me ?
you outta be ashamed . ashamed of yourself .
oh , do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you ?
who ?
data does n't breathe .
alright , six says torch this place ! blow the weapons in place . round up all suspected vee cees and shake it up ! we ai n't got much light left .
listen to me : it 's all right . i 've been expecting something .
you 're not being fair to me . i 'm worried about you and i want to help you get through this thing .
no use , schulz . you might as well come clean . why do n't you just tell 'em it 's me . because i 'm really the illegitimate son of hitler . and after the germans win the war you 'll make me the gauleiter of zinzinnati .
you 're in league with barbossa !
maybe i should talk about this with ruth , or paul .
but one day you wake up and realize you 've been had . of course life is n't like the movies . that 's why there are movies .
mmmmmmmmmhm ... . now , jimmy , what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired ?
yeah ...
no you wo n't . you 'll be back today . now ! you get your ass back here , thelma , now , goddamnit . thelma , do you understand me ?

i 'm going to have to report you to the department of health .
mr . wood ? !
we 'll go in through that large breach .
i do n't want courage . i do n't want to be a warrior . all i 've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
still alive . hmm . i suppose that does n't bode well for poor bruno .
they do n't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole . would you buy this ?
check , all bomb circuits green . okay , lothar .
i get that feeling . you know , mr. tyler , i 'm the kind of woman who does n't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room , i 'm tempted to suspend my disbelief , at least for the evening .
this is dumb , let 's find that chick .
you picked him up and you fucked him , did n't you , bitch ?
you 're fucking crazy richter -- you know that ?
you represent the united states now . we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just .
i know . i 've got one too .
you got a real big mouth , convict .
top o ' the morning , mrs. worley .
i hear nothing .
all of us .
look , there are n't ... there are n't but ...
all right , all right . keep quiet .
nuwanda ? please ?
because i did n't have it . ray , i swear , melanie came in and grabbed it . and someone killed her for it .
you talk to any reporters ? any press ?
jam .
who is they ?
mr. ortega ... what is `` la compania '' ?
but i might not have .
what did i tell you ? what did i say about the three days ... ?
you know , i think it 's a little late for that . do give my regards to gradski if you see him .
do you like that ?
i am sir lancelot of the lake , from across the sea . i am the best knight in the whole of christiandom , and i look for the king who is worthy of my sword 's service .
so what 's the time ?
no , you do n't understand . she 's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances ?
i would start with cocktails .
a visit from an old friend .
that 's what i hear . do n't matter . girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .
then c'mon . follow me . the art 's in the basement , you 're going to get a privileged peek .
what is it ?
listen , you guys . these ghosts are really nice people . i think we scared them off . let 's just leave them alone . okay ?
aaron - lieten to me ... it 's been lasher - from the start !
your majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me . this is a crucial point -- and it is a political one , which your majesty will be in a far better position to answer than i. can napoleon afford to abandon moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you ?
we 've stuck it out for a whole week now ... pretty girl .
no , not yet . i tried to work on it a little last night , but i 'm having trouble concentrating .
you understand ? your drinking 's gettin ' way out of hand . i 'm gon na get you into a program . they got plenty of good ones .

lead man .

are you the proprietor ?
i 'll tell you later .
yeah . i 'm gon na get my ... i 'm gon na get my camera .
hey yeah ?
what do we use for defense ?
children , i know all there is to know about women .
i want to be left alone on this one . algren was killed with my gun .
not no more , they ai n't . i quit that acting shit , man .
what the ... < i > who is this bitch ? < /i > < b > ext . hawthorne community center -- parking lot -- next < /b > ed and choco exit the el camino just as domino retrieves her knife from the windshield . she grips it in her right hand ... threatening them .
most people just want to make money or be famous or something . but you risk everything , just to help people .
any news ?
sometimes i think-sometimes i think i should just live with a woman .
captain , i want you to know that i respect your openness . it would make me happy if you 'd join our table for dinner from now on .
i want to thank you , sir , for giving me the opportunity to work .
let 's just hope you 've kicked the thirst for good . i 'll be watching you close . you start to back-slide --
have you ever done this before ?
transwarp at your command , sir !
you mean like a date ? i thought you were a fag .
the leads , the overhead , the telephones , there 's lots of things .
that 's close enough , major .
why ?
you alone in there ?
million ? ! the killer gets one million dollars for a television interview ?
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman ?
what else ?
i owe you for the rent . it 's only a car . i can get another .
they do n't . they 're always asking about you .
do n't know . that 's how it works .
what kind of trouble are you in ?
you must be chilled to the bone , standing out of doors like this .
m'hm .
yeah . we need out fucking heads examined .
too bad it did n't happen to miser stevens .
aw , shut up . you had me at hello . _ 130 .
what look ?
how old are ya ?
i 'm alright , i 'm dealing .
thanks , but no thanks .
i think it 's what you think .
when ?
well then , does the defense have any witnesses ?
yeah , well , there ai n't no baby in there now . you dig ? there 's nothing in there now .
why not ? hell , just a minute ago , you were asking me to kill you ! and now you want to kill me ! what i should do , goddamnit , is call the police !
how long has -
but you do n't believe it .
want me to drive you home later ?
she has n't cut them yet , and you know it ! so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom , benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - i wo n't have it ! eve harrington has never by word , look , thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love ! and to intimate anything else does n't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of !
we better get it into the box . come on ...
they 've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour , blockhead !
you 've been there ?
oh , is that how it is ?
you wanted to see me , mr. m. ?
icky !
miss braslow , i 'd like to remind you that you are still under oath .
are they going to torture us ?
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death , was it not ?
nothin ' ...
good . i have a job for you in america .
vindication . how would you like to get some ? a chance to prove that , though your facts were n't entirely straight , your theory was correct .
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality ?
let 's make it at eight .
be careful now . unless you know how it works , it 's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...

the only thing i ever told him about life was , `` keep out of the park after the sun goes down . ''

yes , mrs. slossum told me -- lucy ca n't even keep a secret -- selectman -- my son -- well , who would have thought of that ?
ok. it 's a strange world , sandy . this is what i have found out . what i think i have found out . dorothy vallens is married to a man named don . they have a son . i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don 's ears . i think he is holding them to make her do things for him . i think she wants to die . the ears were for her a warning to stay alive . there is another man involved . i call him the `` yellow man '' . you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door . i do n't know what he does but i think he 's on drugs supplied by frank . frank is a very dangerous man .
-- do n't you miss the grand scheme too .

you ?
hey , sheriff . how 's everything ?

four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the seine , and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side . the girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees ...
do n't be like that . think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs .
harry .
i did n't ask what your staff thinks , henry . what do you think ?
i do n't understand .
jean-luc picard ... my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi .

i 'll give you a gut feeling , you little ... hey ... < u > hey < /u > ! get that stick out of your mouth . these things are killers , man . do n't you go to school , listen to smokey the bear and all that ...
because if we lose , we lose more than a strike . we lose the union . and the men know this . and if we win , we win more than a few demands . we win ... ... something bigger . hope . hope for our kids . juanito ca n't grow strong on milk alone .

that 's an after-market alarm . ca n't just cut her wires ...
are you ready ?
twenty minutes ...
you did n't give them a name .
do n't worry , gina ! mummy and daddy love each other .
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army . there 's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal . they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests .
you did n't say anything about my hair .
if god intends you to go , then you will go .
well , you 're probably right . i guess that 's all that hubris is .
i do n't know . i may be in love with him .

he followed my birds into their coop . here , you want him ?
i 'm gon na go make a stink . sit tight . i 'll make sure you get a change of clothes .
merrick . you made a joke . are you okay , i mean , do you want to lie down ? i know it hurts the first time .
well , one thing immediately comes to mind , if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter .
what do i do with it ? nothing . it 's for peace of mind . it 's for the principle .
go to lunch , will you ...
all right , ma . i 'll be back in about an hour , an hour anna half .
the fences are electrified , right ?
i do n't want a bodyguard . i want the man i fell in love with .

i do n't know what i 'm supposed say , mary . i want to do the right thing here .
i 'll make sure the alarm is set from now on .
you 're one of william 's kids , huh ?
bullshit .
my sister believes in fate , but not hell . that 's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you do n't hear that much about purgatory anymore . but every day she asks her boss to pray i do n't fuck up . whatta you think , you think there 's a hell , jack ?
i suppose you wish you were somewhere else ?
haw-haw ! why do n't you run off and find a cop and i 'll wait right here .
yeah ...

every word that boy said is the truth ! i 'm not fit for office ! i 'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land ! expel me -- !
in my bedroom , sleeping .
next time , when you want two corned beef sandwiches , say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . '' when you want two ginger ales , say , `` two ginger ales . ''
i 've got a gift just like you do . my gift is i just know what people mean , even if they ca n't say it . it helps when you 're trying to communicate with fighter pilots . like what you just said was `` i 'm embarrassed , i feel i 've done something wrong , that i 've failed , and i do n't think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting , intelligent woman like yourself . '' that about it ?
you in a hurry ?
something i do n't already know ?
no thank you .
you had to tell him .

i do n't need any advice from you ! get me a doctor !
good morning .
pleased to meet you finally , george . i am augusto oliveras .
what 's that ?
actually , that 's why i stopped by . he 's realy sorry , he wanted to make it , but then he ... ran into a problem .
yeah , i was drinking .
maybe , later we could take a look .
wrong cabinet .
this . i ca n't tell you how sorry i am !
what 's your name ?
sure .
well , then forget all this stern dad stuff .
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .
well ... 'bye .
alright , come with me .
the reality is , you take away the horror of this situation , take away the tragedy of the death , take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned , beaten , into your head since grade one . what are we left with ? what ? a 115 lb . problem . 115 lbs . that must be moved from point a to point b. now , a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line . but that line exists and i see it.i see that line . trust me . adam . trust me ... i can take care of this .
no , i just promised myself i 'd give it a try . i got ta get out there sooner or later .
here 's a nice place .
i do n't know much about him .
what are you talking about ?
i understand ... i understand perfectly .
i 'm quitting .
this is n't possible . and even if it is ... what the hell am i doing here ? did you drag me in here too ?
my dear senator , have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a bill passed ?
he goes to my father 's church . he could 've died --
well sir , to be a putterer , one 's mind must be at ease . a person with a problem could never be a putterer . for instance , sir , a fish can putter in water but not on land because he 'd be out of place . an eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage , because he 'd be restless and unhappy . now sir , if you will pardon me , with all due respect , sir , as a smythe to a smith , you are an eagle in a cage .
yes .
you choose your level of involvement . i wo n't make decisions for you .
but i think it 's time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you -- why have n't you ever married ?
-- please -- jason -- omigod --
why ? what 's in lisbon ?
we do n't doubt that , but there 's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station . have you made any purchases here today ?
will i see you again ?
it 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father . ultimately , it 'll lead to her suicide . nice work , daddy .
stop !
what happened ?
right . you ca n't sleep here .
you know , it 's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form , and now we run into a veritable zoo .
your timing , and your shoes , are impeccable ... good to see you , alex , been having a lousy day .
you do n't have to . you just have to believe in energy .
keep your voice down .
do you think the police did a good job ?
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly . you wo n't get very far . think it over .
with the tenors .
who said i was depressed ?
what do you want with those two medical officers ?
a-fuckin'-men !
emma , you know i have great ... admiration for you .
look , miss thompson , i do n't know what you want from me .
my boss is a guy named bobo justus , back in baltimore . when a long shot gets too much action , i have to put money on that horse at the track , because it 's the only way to get the odds down .
belle dee . i 'm from over the mountain .
but that 's all behind us now .
you voted for him .
everybody needs it . ask prudential . or allstate .
how much longer we got ta be shut up in this fuckin ' sweatbox ?
do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off ?
this was my wife 's father 's place . originally .
you should 've told us you were coming , ma . we would 've come and got you .
is there anything i can do for you ?
what purpose does this serve ?
the age of ragnarok ends ...
i understand the business reasons .
right .
i never liked her , but she did n't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that . the whole thing 's just kinda sad and lame at the same time .
wow . um , well ... ca n't you just force yourself awake ?
all right , tom -- it 's true . i know it 's true .
let me guess . we 're going on a `` long trip '' .
we need experience .
hey ! what are you doing here ?
no , it ca n't !
oh , i like her . i like her a lot . i want to save this one for later . something that tasty you do n't eat all at once . go back to your alter- egos , we 'll regroup in the morning .
a real live pimp ?
doc- ...
always making yourself beautiful for me , are n't you ? so , gus , can you make vulcan do what i want it to ? you did n't answer me , pal . did you hear about that prison riot last week ? it seems they were complaining about rats in the cells ...
what about this week 's check ?
i thought maybe i could put in a word for you with mr. sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter ?
diss digg , diss digg , diss digg .
it 'll take a couple of years of steady production , but i 'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself , the foundation of all finance , will lose its meaning . brokers , economists , and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns . markets will crash- crash . financial empires will crumble-crumble .
no killing ?
why am i calling you ? you 're my father . i 'm not supposed to call you ? what 's the matter with wanting to talk to you , daddy ?
what 's with all this pudding , what is this ?
at least they were n't lit .
... if we do n't get out of this tunnel !
i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ?
oh , i thought there was something funny ... you see , bruce , you do n't mind if i call you bruce , do you ? after all , we 're practically related --
sure , cease . they make us do stupid things , do n't they .
we 're all assholes , bernie ?
that 's an order !
i could n't call ! you sent me to the wrong year ! it was 1989 .
which way are the rooms ?
he taken the lord 's name in vain and he trampled on his holy book !
no . how 's angela ? how 's she taking it ?
people have tried this before , jake . it 's never worked . teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it . last year , mumps got pinched in l.a .
nobody wants to hurt you peaches !
there , there , my baby .
oh , and there 's another thing about new york . see ... you-you wan na see a movie , you have to stand in a long line .
like a real sister ?
oh yes , sir . he 's all right . and he 's working on it very hard .
it looks like scurvy .
no .
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it .
look , i 'm kind of in a hurry .
not a bad business . this thing would still be growing , too . the first printing order on misery 's child was the most ever -- over a million .
propagate -- you know , multiply -- baby flies ?
captain , i do n't recommend transporting , that ion storm does n't look very neighborly . -it could head this way with- out much warning .
is that why you 're here ? to blame ...
i wo n't let him . he belongs to me now . bye , sweetie .
tell me . when will the doctor be awake ?
yes . i could n't pass the test .
i have never seen a face like that before . it must be the look of great age . whoever he was he was terribly old .
it would n't work .
a man ? was it a dream ?
there is no other way .
why ?
i do n't like the word gay .
`` you 're doin ' great , mayor cobblepot . '' `` your table is ready , mayor cobblepot . '' `` i need you , oswald . i need you now . that 's the biggest parasol i ever -- ''
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ?
yes . it 's not a very good name , is it ? but we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need !
look ! just get everyone together , get off the ship ... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come ! that 's the only way you 're going to live .
i want our boy back .
so that 's it ...
you know , i was on this plane once . and i 'm sittin ' there and the captain comes on and is like `` we 'll be cruising at 35,000 feet , '' and does his thing , then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off . then he says `` man , all i want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee . '' so the stewardess goes runnin ' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike 's still on , and this guy in the back of the plane goes `` do n't forget the coffee ! ''
why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .
hmm .
i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store . that man last night -- the one that followed me --
... and what do you call these ?
finally someone who 's noticed ! i 'm a great admirer of yours , too , mr. nixon . you are an unusual politician . we share a mutual idol -- `` six crises '' sounds like a page from churchill .
if that 's a potential you see yourself fulfilling ... i mean ... my , i sound a bit --
yeah i get bored .
will you all stop it , you 're like a gang of school kids . i knew this was going to happen one day .
well , then i have spoiled your dinner -- `` your food wo n't digest , and your wine will sour . ''
we do n't know how , but sid 6.7 made himself into an android .
at a press conference .
why are you looking at me like that ?
that little girl ? ha . now go on , get me some tools .
you 're too young to be studying criminal behavior . it 's making you obsessive .
it 's not that .
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring ? and you 'll meet some french girl who can speak your own language . no thank you !
i 'm sure there 's a dozen teachers better than this clown . more qualified . goddamn phony .
okay . and tomorrow night , i 'll take you to a movie , okay ?
good evening , your highness .
oh ... i ca n't . business .
what the hell ...
what a ... jerk !
you know , i could take those whales somewhere they would n't be hunted .
that 's right .
wait five minutes , and go to my office . you 'll get federal protection after that .
forget that ...
it came over from vietnam , you know .
take your time , jer .
i thought you 'd be thrilled . you 're being taken seriously .
leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell jimmy . but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered . do you realize what leo could have told jimmy ? ! do you ? !
not having that , which , having , makes them short .
do you want to leave your husband ?
things . this is my country , you know .
i was n't scratching !
tom ...
i know very well what you 're talking about . you 're talking about something you ca n't get your fingers on , and it 's galling you . that 's what you 're talking about , i know . well , i 've said too much . i . . . you 're the board here . you do what you want with this thing . just one thing more , though . this town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter . come on , uncle billy !
once upon a time , about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father 's olive oil business . they had al capone send some men in from chicago to kill my father , and they almost did .
for god 's sake do n't start in on heidi again ...
tomorrow ?
i can see that ...
this is the starship enterprise .
are you getting tired ?
damn you , shelly !
come to think of it , how 'bout some money upfront ?
i 've come here to arrest you for murder .
i 'm admiring your costume . what `` movie '' are you going as again ?
yeah..
that greek guy who won at the end . you paid him out in 25s not 20s .
no !
olive or eyeball ?
stop pressuring me ...
two a year since i was twelve . you do the math .
henry hill .
hey , by the way , i 'm really sorry about your wife leavin ' you .
please do n't misunderstand . i am grateful for your hospitality and --
he killed her john . he killed her and i did n't do a thing to stop it .
well , you 're two up on me now .
am i interrupting ?
did n't catch his or her name , just followed them down here . somebody all in white surgical gown .
agnes ... agnes ...
you got ta stop 'em . we know it 's jack and bobby 's idea -- they leaked it to lippman . the military guys are going ape , and they 're not alone .
we took a nip of whiskey .
how can it be bullshit to state a preference ?
a few years ago , the army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder , gentler military . he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country .
he 's working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested , analyzed before --
how do you act when someone trys to kill you ?
feeling better ?
forget her , she 's a pain in the ass . let her hang there .
liz -- can i call you liz ? it 's a beautiful name --
no . if you 're smart , you run like hell .
then what 's stopping you ?
look , i came here to get papers to travel to paris and . . .
oh really .
we 're waiting on carmine .
it says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the ludovico treatment . alex signs . governor gathers up papers . alex dots the last `` i '' and smiles .
i 'm not armed . well ?
oh my god .
freaked me out so bad i hid in a shopping cart for four hours . 'course , missed the show ...
they got it an a long playing record now - music to string her along by . my wife does n't understand me -- we have n't gotten along for years -- you 're the best thing that ever happened to me --
looks like a diner .
a little misunderstanding among my associates .
tonight we 're having a little party among ourselves . 8 o'clock in my suite ?
whatta you mean ?
ha . some wonder drug ...
help me .
i can see why .
no . i have a better idea . in fact , mr. bond may have actually improved my original plan . bring them both to hong kong . and make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve .
uh-huh .
that 's wonderful . where did you ever learn it ?
you know i do . i even wrote you into my will .
oh !
and do n't forget : never let your enemy get behind you .
yes , i 'm having trouble controlling ... the volume of my voice !
do n't get out of the car .
what ?
where do they come up with this stuff ? !
you were never that innocent sugarpie .
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 , is that correct ?
i do n't know . maybe he does n't know , either .
what 's gotten into you , baxter ?
who was it ?
yeah .
this ? temporary . to pay the bills and save . i got plans ...
william would never have gone to a state school .
... to take any extreme measures i deem necessary ...
you 're welcome . hare krishna .
do n't look so glum , viktor . it 's not a death sentence .
and your social security number .
no sir .
they do this with impunity !
bullshit , bullshit dad we got ta get his money --
what happened ?
which one ?
no .
take as much room as you want
do n't stop . just ride me up past the rooms .
deeds ! who do you think i 'm talking about ?
who are these people ?
one book : swedish-made penis enlarger pumps and me : this sort of thing is my bag , baby , by austin powers .
what do you do for that hundred a week . fall out of bed ?
i 'll tell you why you did n't help - because you 're a chickenshit tweaking snitch . you 're a bottom feader , flynne .
yes , well , what i 'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity . she ca n't wait too long , you know . now , there 's no reason why you must lose yours . i mean , just ponder it a bit , that 's all .
school , school . regular . i used to get pretty good grades in school , you know .
well , it 's friday night and you 're a beautiful girl . i guess you would have a date , that does that .
c'mon , sal .
it 's a promise ?
let me tell you why you are here . you have come because you know something . what you know you ca n't explain but you feel it . you 've felt it your whole life , felt that something is wrong with the world . you do n't know what , but it 's there like a splinter in your mind , driving you mad . it is this feeling that brought you to me . do you know what i 'm talking about ?
yeah , it 's great , is n't it . i think it 's so cool ... have a girl as a friend .
it wo n't work like that .
you know where they get this fertility stuff ? they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns .
i 'll help her , i promise , but i think you should tell me where the stones are !
swallows , unsure what heaven or hell awaits him .
are you here to help me ?
i wish you would n't talk too much . we let a car get away .
then you tell me , what just happened ?
they took the tapes .
it is no trouble at all , my child . this is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create . my footing is not too secure .
wake up , people ! we all have to do things that are n't pretty sometimes ! it 's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for ! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals ?
get away from me ! !
close it !

your daughter 's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet .
okay .
215 continued :
a heart --
okay , someone 's expecting us . turn on your locators -- anyone sees anything ...
change the channel !
where 's the victory ?
well , there 's a lot riding on this project .
i 'll just say that we had a great night together .
you see ? thea believes it , too !
i did n't know your size .
what do you have to do to get ready ?
i think it 's important not to get depressed . depression is a terrible thing . they say it can bring on illness .
would you stay , doctor ? i may need assistance .
please . and you 're sweating him ? you 're `` all that '' and you 're sweating some lawn jockey ?
i 'm serious . there 's nothing for you down there . it 's dangerous .
at times . at other times i think she was ... more . but who would know that better than you . i mean , you sure 'nough you her .
how many pounds i got ta lose ?
sorry ? !
yeah .
i 'm thinking about producing .
what will they do to you ?
we 'll make up some kind of lie . they wo n't find the gold .
wait a minute - let me out .
delta ?
billy ? what the ...
oh , my dear god ...
she says it 's for the times when he 's good to her . she 's lonely since daddy died . she said sometimes she do n't know why . he threatened to kill her if she ever left him . my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama . vaughan , he 's real good to mama . vaughan that you met . but he 's not able to do anything to doyle , he 's funny you know . not funny ha , ha , funny queer . he likes to go with men instead of women . that makes him not to be able to fight too good . he sure is nice though . he 's from st. louis . people who are queer can get along better in a big town . he got transferred here to work . but mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him . for bein ' the way he is . i wish he liked to go with women . i 'd rather him be mama 's boyfriend than doyle .
... from mavis , also .
i 'm not just selling the script . i 'm selling me . demille always said i was his greatest star .
it 's what you would do to me
just for the honeymoon .
oh . i did n't look at my faxes today . we left before sunrise .
i just ca n't , son -- not the head and tail both !
sounds good .
let 's get on with what ? what is this anyway ? a kangaroo court ? why do n't you get a rope and do it right ?
is that what you wanted to hear ? something cold blooded ... something remorseless ...
shhhhhhh . i do n't have this mountain of available time ... i got to get to my restaurant on time . do you know how hard it is for me to be here ?
right . sign here for your valuable property . alex signs .
listen , nick , you got ta understand my situation . i 'm responsible for thousands of people . i got a hundred million a year goin ' through the place . it 's all over , i 'm gon na tell you , it 's all over , if i do n't get that license . and believe me , if it goes bad for me , it 's gon na go bad for a lot of people , you understand ?
what is it ? what do you see ? !
uncle frank ?
i did n't kill your wife .
c'mon , c'mon , just give me the money .
well , believe what you want , boss , but we got to be more careful . all these new volunteers , any one of them could be ...
who cares ? ! we 're on a roll ! these are the moments in life you 're supposed to grab .
computer , this is captain standard . what conditions are you talking about ?
this , this is life indeed ! life worth preserving , such life as juba never felt till now .
what 're you doing out of uniform , sid ? you do n't want to get in trouble .
my pleasure . i 'm always happy to assist in a little larceny .
yes . you were a marine .
sammy . remember sammy . you told me about sammy .
i love this hotel . i stay here every time i visit my parents .
do you wan na to go to memphis and get married ?
i see . that beer made me dizzy .
she did n't work out , had to cut her loose .
thanks for your help on the glasses thing .
do you like it ?
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation .
as far as touching things , yes . but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- it wo n't go away god - if i could just understand it .
i 'm wise to you , i should have seen it before , you rotten son of a bitch . how is it , huh ? how do you like --
no ... you stay in the room and make sure he does n't leave .
tread matches . it 's the car .
what do you want ?
yeah . i 'm not , like , a robert frost lover by any stretch . his stuff seems strictly grade school to me . but this made me cry for some reason . maybe because it is grade school . y'know ?
i do n't need it that badly . i do n't enjoy crashing other people 's parties .
the deal still stands , our other thing .
what did he mean ?
where 's my name ?
mr. gittes , my field men are out and i ca n't give you an exact location ...
i suppose he 's fixing it up - i know i 'd never get that through .
okay ... okay ... i put it down . now open that door . mister fisher 's right on the other side of that door . he 's an actor ...
you 're either having a seizure or you just said `` hello . ''
no .
does brumby get a kick out of that crap ?
i feel sick .
because i 'm the one who called the police , you know .
hey daniel ! hello ? do you guys speak english ?
i just want the key to my jewelry , and i want you to let me go .
you are n't jealous , are you dodge ?
that was a great night .
maybe i 've been a little unfair . but is this really the time ?
lee , i 've missed you , brother . i heard about the two americans , i 'm so sorry , you must be under great pressure .
'you duff anderson ?
i have to go ...
does n't the water get to your nails ?
it 's a little late , you son of a bitch . there 's a friggin ' monster loose in here ! get the fbi , the fire department . find metal cutters , cut through . and bring a cannon . the damn thing is huge .
she laughed and told me that we were being silly , that we did n't care for each other any more but we need n't hate each other ... ... she said she wanted to be friends .
what did you take these for ?
what are you doing up so early ?
plates match .
milt joyce , owner-operator .
now give the signal .
when we picked him up , he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about hubley .
mostly people in the casino business . a few drug dealers .
he was a runner for top dollar . just muscle .
hey , man , is the piss-ass money you 're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation ?
that 's a lie .
if i tell you , i might not be able to finish it .
no ! you 've gone through way too much to back down now . get over there and do something -- i ca n't stand watching this .
and you believed him when he told you he had done that .
i 'll take care of that corey , but i need this now .
... you 're ed crane ?
what ?
why all of a sudden are you flippin ' on me ? this blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go . do n't even try to play it like you ai n't a part of all this . you down with delacroix .
you 're one man . you ca n't save everybody .
yeah ... okay ... he did
still , i do miss her . i only wish she could have lived to see all this .
guess that 's why he hid it there . let 's go .
we 'll talk when we get back to seattle .
well , why stop at that ?
patrick bateman 's office .
why are you taking this out on < u > him < /u > ?
i 've already seen your photographs .
nobody said ... norman ... what ? why are you looking at me like that ?
it 's too late , ted . when i get back to chicago , i 'm going to start my life all over again . i 'm sorry .
how about this child ? you expect *her* to be responsible ?
huh ?
think about it . on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years , do n't you think ? . you took my mother , so i took yours . big sympathy factor . maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior . it certainly fucked you up . it made you have sex with a psychopath .
no you wo n't . you 'll compromise ... like always .
it 's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung ... hands to the side ...
how long 's it gon na take , for you to drink yourself to death ?
yeah . can i borrow five bucks ?
in the sequel , james , two lady scientists should make a monster . and our monster would be gary cooper .
yes , mother ...
do his job .
compared to you , my friend , shapeley 's an amateur . whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this ! you 're positively the most conceited ?
about you .
well , well . small world , is n't it ?
yeasts ? thank you , beth , but i do n't think we 're gon na open it up and find a loaf of bread .
y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments .
maybe that 's jus ' what he done .
but what about me ?
where the hell are you ?
i did n't give 'em the m-
i do n't need a doctor , i need a different job .
get a life .
i 'm a-tryin ' , ma . honest i am .
absolutely .
poppa joe , you want me to go now ?
it 's gone on long enough . you 're out .
is n't she lovely ?
where was i ?
i have to talk to her about my experimental film . it 's very ... experimental .
you will not be common ! ! !
houston , huh ? i hear they let you boys run wild up there .
lena ?
pardon me ?
do they know about you ?
oh , yeah , i 'm calm . in fact , i 'm totally `` relaxed ... ''
unless i miss my bet ... my wife .
why 'd you move all the furniture around ?
do n't you think they 'd just love another song instead ?
electro-shock therapy , my friend . five cents ' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody 's hair .
we 're pulling it like a zipper across space ...
never ! never ! i 'll never forget you . i wanted to marry you . do n't you understand ! i love you . i love you !
oh yeah ? what kind is that ?
erin knows , does n't she ?
well , press something !
god , it 's wonderful to see you . where 's greg ?
i do n't believe you . my father was explaining to mr. griffin . that is how i found out .
i did n't know either . that 's why i told jester to prepare your papers .
give me the valium .
in case you do n't know , emily , this - this gentleman - is -
darcy ?
how well are you trained in music ?
is everything ok ?
and i 'm begging for my life -- and yours .
what was that ?
no , it - it - nicky , when you asked me if you could come out here , what did i tell you ? i mean , you asked me , and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said , but what did i tell you ? do you remember what i told ...
i guess this is what they call `` ironee '' ? hunh ?
why do n't i just drag you off ? all right -- i will . right after we get the blood tests .
smells like a battle .
hurray !
yeah ...
i say let loverboy watch his movie . and be grateful boone 's not cutting shirley temple 's lawn .
i could stand something regular .
so you knew sidney prescott 's mother .
hello , quince .
yeah , give me a minute .
i do n't see anything .
how 'd you know i was in here ?
uh , actually ... yes ... i ... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
mr. danvers called . i 'll get a new one with the insurance money . b.f.d .
look , i 'm sorry --
someone should stand up and strike back .
just go . please . why do n't you go ?
okay , jammer . no problem . you stay right here . i have to go there to the end ... you 'll see my lights . we 'll stay in voice contact . just hold onto the rope . five more minutes . okay ?
but morals come from the heart , not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore , she 's not immoral . not really .
you still want to be transferred to the other paper ?
absolutely .
sir shiv-a-lot . he likes to cut .
hound of resurrection --
i 'd say you 've got about two minutes .
i do n't .
no , no no ! ! it 'll be okay . stay with us !
great move . great
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger 's and walmart . neither of which keep purchase records .
yes , of course , people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died , you know how these things happen .
they can come in now .
them days , you deal with sheriff wade or you did n't deal at all . first of the month , every month , he remind you of who you really workin ' for .
mr. deeds is drawing on his warped imagination !
i guess i 've come to quite a place .
you said that boyd .
well , er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning .
it must feel great .
are you married ?
stuart ?
do you want me to stick around ?
red flag , man .
where did you get this power ?
not as yet , sir .
i wanted it over fast . it felt dirty to not tell you .
you sure you wo n't change your mind ?
suleiman !
the license ! you get it ? !
you 're welcome . sow how does it feel to ... i know you got ta go -- me too . we 're very busy here .
it 's a sign i 've watched this movie too many times . i 'm so stupid . from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio , i 've been a complete jerk .
i 'm telling you , harry 's lost it . he 's saying there 's a deathwish out for each of us .
i 'm so sorry peter . gee , that sure puts my problems in perspective .
why did you go to chicago ?
jeanne , listen to me very carefully . we are all men of faith , and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own . we do so in the name of our holy mother church , who never closes her arms to those who would return to her . but we can not help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority . take heed of this charitable admonition , for if you persist in refusing our help , then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers , and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you . so now ... will you please recite our lord 's prayer ?
mudhole ? slimy ? my home this is .
you have it ?
okay , look , we 're gon na make a trade . you cross the street , leave her on the sidewalk . i will leave him on this side . then we trade places . you get him , i get her . get the picture , lois ?
i 've got a better idea ...
excuse me . yeah ...
i do n't hear this .
skeleton keys never work . anyway , this can wait . we 'll get a crowbar later . your mother ...
how 's david ?
one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest , a great storm blew up out of nowhere . but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice , nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch ... and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb ! she- never-spoke-another-word .
we hit land .
ask him . ask your saint who he is . ask him who he 's killed .
johnny , all i can say is we better come up with something real soon .
he 's a lawyer . please , sit , here ...
oh - in here .
benjamin ?
see .
okay .
you told her i never said i love you before ?
what 's her name , anyway ?
lloyd , listen to me . everything has changed . you 've had sex . no matter what you might think , nothing will ever be the same between you two . you might be sixty . you might be walking down the street , and you 'll talk to her about something , whatever . but what you 'll really be thinking is 'we had sex ' .
i was going to be a physician , i am a physician , but i kept drifting over to criminal psych . this seems to be the best of both . my parents still have n't forgiven me .
boy , i thought gordon was a tough businessman , but somebody 's really taking him to the cleaners here .
i swear , captain , one hundred thousand francs , enough for a house . i will get the money , you keep them outside .
that depends on your definition of ghosts . i 'm going to check on her , and then i 'm going to stay awake .
he 's always got it bad as long as i 'm running in the other direction . do n't be fooled , he 's no different than any other guy . he knows how to chase and that 's it . once he 's caught you , he do n't know what to do . so he runs away .
huh ? ! but , buddy --
thank you .
that your father and i 棗
i know you do , sidney .

why did n't you call ?
i was n't doing business .
incredible similarity .
last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced . tonight i 'm doing superfreak , i do n't care what he says . where is he ?
there 're no cars on this street .
and how come you call yourselves cowboys ? cowhands ride for the brand .
he 'll be here in a little while , he 's takin ' me to get an ice cream .
jimmy , come on . fuck 'em . do n't give them the satisfaction .
well , about - uh - eleven o'clock .
i do n't believe you . there has to be more .
seal the cave ?
in the west , it 's one wife for one husband , but different cultures have different rules .
they 're pretending it 's process . bullshit , it 's foregone .
what did you find ?
why would we do that ?
that 's why i can tell you , straight out , you think too much about irena -- blame yourself for her death . and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy .
it 's michael . how are you , mom ?
every time you and marlon --
hi , adam . this is , uh ... .
do you want to learn or not ?

why so vague ? why so evasive ? he could be somebody hot .
do n't hate me , trinity . i 'm just the messenger . and right now i 'm going to prove it to you .
i prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place .
she would n't let me . she 's the only reason you 're alive .
vada what about you , who have you come up with ?
il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali ?

i 'm sure you would .
oh , god , michael , i know . why does everything have to be so hard ?
ready to tell me what kind of 'outing ' this is ?
thank you , bob . the electricity is everywhere tonight . rocky balboa , a fifty-to-one underdog , is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples ' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine , 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier . ' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring ... his record is forty-four wins , twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts .

jeffrey , how are you ? how 's the family , okay ?
yeah , like they got a plan ...
oh , yes , what ? you 'd < u > bribe < /u > me , to , to , to , `` release '' you ... ?
have any other people ever passed through ?
that 's comforting .
i do n't know no grace skinner .
but he 's got five times the man-power to draw on .
forgot my car keys . what are you doing on the fourth floor ?
good morning .
i 'm afraid i 'm not at leisure this very moment . just leave them with me . i assure you they will be quite safe .
i said i had no family -- i did n't say i had an empty apartment .
i got drunk . i puked . i got rejected . it was big fun .
that 's right , of course .

it 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too .
yes .
i do n't want to sleep . tell me something .

i do n't think so . i mean , him , he could be a scientist , maybe . but you ... exterminator , i 'd understand . but entopolgist ? no way .
do n't you trust your own eyes .

sometimes i think all men are fools ! ...

fine . i 'm fine . how are you ?

it 's true .

i 'll have to come and hear you play . what do you play .

i do n't know where you 'd start .
and when i try to talk to you seriously , when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life , how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts , what do you do -- you mock me !
starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record . we can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander . he fought seventeen major engagements in the war . all successful . beyond that , we know nothing .
then , i 'll see you around .

i know .
now , what 's this ?
yes , it is . and you know who 's responsible ?
well , if this crook 's a brewers fan , his ass has got ta be from wisconsin . and i 'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed joe to a damned-if-i- know , that in milwaukee they got a sheet on this mr. white motherfucker 's ass . i want you to go through the mugs of guys from old milwaukee with a history of armed robbery , and put a name to that face .
almost forgot . that ten grand of yours . it 's in the envelope by the door .
can i see it ?
no . i 'm not .
you 're the best nurse i can think of --
is that what you 're asking me ? is there something wrong with anything ?
the first rule of fight club is -- you do n't talk about fight club .
really ? yeah . okay .
your lucille ? man , you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself .
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death , but i 'm consuming . do you mind ?
hey look . you think i 'm gon na run out on ya or somethin ' ? just cause we hit it big . luther , i owe you everything . if you had n't taught me con , i would n't know nothin ' .
he was hurt , but not seriously . he 'll be fine .
what 's that ?
i got it .
claudia : why do n't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers , ok ?
my name is barry egan and i spoke to you ... .you called me , you remember ?

every *aspect* of this matter -- the gentleman 's attack on that section -- everything -- was dealt with in the committee hearing --
do n't fight .
you got about five minutes and change .
i 'm cancelling the engagement .
there 's only two of them now .
charlie was n't drunk last night .
i should leave . you probably need your rest .
i 'm talking about you . and what you want .
is she here ? george , kristina hates you . you fucked her over one too many times . and i 'm not here to socialize . did you hear about diego ?
you said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something .
looks like epps ' gon na get some tonight .
the sooner we get under way , the sooner we are to spending what 's ours .
yo -- i ai n't mad . i 'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an ' paulie knows it .
julie , i 'll tell you something that is the god 's honest truth . i 've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .
we are totally booked .
it 's very interesting .
i 'm not wrong . she told me so . besides , she would n't have to tell me . i 'd know anyway . i found out a lot of things last night . i 'm not ashamed of it either . it 's probably one of the few decent things that 's ever happened in this hellish place .
you remember that far back ? boy , i ca n't even remember yesterday .
mm-hm .
answer the question and i will .
dandridge is a condescending prick . ride with me . it would be because i want you to .
in japan , men come first and women come second .
he did !
you know what a mixer ball is ? it 's like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . buzz grumpily waves at him to sit .
ho 's a fucking pimp ! he encourages wendy to turn tricks . and she 's his fucking wife !
nice ...
hey , big guy , you getting tired , yet ? i am . this is vivian . you two been together long ? you and edward ?
but i do miss that green sport coat of yours .
how do you remember how to talk ?
but how can i win ? adrian is stronger and smarter than me .
hildy johnson ... oh , hello , bruce . have you got it ? is it certified ?
tell me about the door . do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ? ... harry ?
well , look at this .
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows ca n't say anything .
my father did . believe it or not , that little baby is me .
i do n't give a shit .
i 'm a little thrown . i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here .
and sorry , man , but no dogs allowed .
no !
they may be looking for us , james . use this . you can fix it in the men 's room .
oh , excuse me .
so ?
negative five ?
i was the lesser of two evils .
that was then . this is now . who am i talking to ?
aw , c'mon boy . what 's the difference ? you said yourself the stuff that 's there now is rough .
it 's your dirty roll , cheswick .
but i guess she told dieter .
you know , my dad 's done some work for kaminski ...
you 're serious .
you can take that out to the car .
no thanks .
marry me instead .
she 's out .
i have n't been a writer since i got into the misery business --
it 's saturday .
good , james . if the zodiac killer calls , be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right .
never call him that . he 's strictly an illusionist .
it 's a means to summon us -- it 's called the lament configuration .
what 's wrong , jake ? forget to take your antidote ?
you 're insane .
vecchio .
it 's all i think about anymore .
jittery is the word .
such a wiseass . but go ahead . crack wise . that 's why you 're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day 's work . i got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch . you make sure this gets back . the number 's eight-twelve-wynarski . and i wanted to get a damn movie , too .
friend of yours ?
hey fuck you damone . there 's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy . what have you got to prove ?
what did i do ?
in charge . just me'n him . no interference . they do n't even want to hear from us until we 're done . i love the f.b.i . i love the f.b.i .
curing countless diseases , not just ours .
how 'd it go ? did you read it to her ?
i thought you 'd be interested . i 'd like you to be in on everything , annie . not just the finished book , but how it 's written .
yeah . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .
-- but you can do my o-chem lab in under an hour , you can --
i reckon .
bring the money in and they follow it ?
look , man , i do n't want friendly conversation . i do n't want to be your friend . i 've seen your friends and i do n't like them . i just want to do this thing and get back to new york in time to start my job .
it 's blake . how do you feel about wisconsin ?
thank you ... have you any news ?
well , then , i shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters , so you can avoid their castles .
the point is , if you unplug me when i 'm flatlines , i 'm history . i got no way back .
what is that ? a kind of chair ? i never heard of no ratan .
-- you want to wear women 's clothes , or you get off ripping things --
it 's about money , all right , but not yours . you see , me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance .
headache , nausea , lights ?
you and maryjane are n't lovers .
cancel that , dieter .
righto !
best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this , ellie -- sometimes they bite .
nervous ?
i envy you guys . taking a chance like that .
gosh , this is really a great conversation -- i ca n't believe i said that out loud .
oh , god ... !
well , it seems that since lila broached the subject of children , you 've been on edge and i know you have an issue with the , uh , body hair .
the swamp of betrayal . be glad we do n't have to cross it .
beidermeyer ?
do you think i should take her to see a psychiatrist ?
i could have been better !
coffee .
fine .
okay , let 's hear it . i 'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house .
i would feel nothing about my life ? is that what you want to hear ? !
shut the hell up .
you ca n't testify .
so the harkonnens will rid you of house atreides ...
you could 've hit me .
really , i do n't want to .
machines can be helpful sometimes , but they can also be a pain in the ass . ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill . i do n't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it 's their personalities that usually get me . somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image . if that 's true , whoever made esper should have been shot .
understood . if you 'll excuse me detective . gale .
it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .
i 'm okay , matt .
herb wants to see me ?
you said it was a strange world . and you 're the strangest part of it . are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps .
you will or you 'll be back at bet so quick you 'll never know what hit you . i need a mid-season replacement and pronto . it will be on the fast track .
good . i 've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department .
i 'd like to know what ...
i did n't know what really being alone was . no one back here does .
waitaminute -
yeah .
stand up and see for yourself .
can i go to dance tomorrow ? i 'm better ...
you 're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance , are you ?
i do n't want to see you anymore .
stu miley .
she 's working . i need a break anyway . she 's getting a little clingy . this is our day !
lay them down .
what ?
you were referred here by the department of employment . there 's no need for you to get you `` foot in the door '' , as you put it .
when does he graduate high school ?
oh . you know him .
then why bother curing me ?
do n't you think it 's time to go now ? running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people .
it 'll only take a second .
you what ?
you said that already .
no , there 's a fourth . numbness . you do everything right , but you feel nothing either way .
i 'm going to tell him you said that .
was it worth it ?
want me to lead ?
tell me how it happens .
gee , grady , that sounded so heartfelt . i do n't know whether to swoon or smirk .
you stay out of this , look , if i had a red xk-150 with a black interior , i sure as hell would n't be handing out relationship advice .
it 's as though he 'd trapped a real cuckoo inside .
you really think he wanted to kill you ?
i 'm cindy .
somebody told her .
two days gone . they 're negotiating a ransom .
excuse me , did you say an instant of purity ? what was the instant of purity ? the bodies you left behind on your bloody trail ?
really ? what is it he 's writing ?
you think you 're dreaming me , like you dream her . understand something : i am the real gibarian . just a new incarnation .
i 'd like to commission a work . i 'm a great admirer of yours .
auto-shop ?
just think about it .
oh , fine . she 's gone away for a little while and when she comes back i 've sort of resolved to really tell her how much i care for her .
in a box under my seat .
it 's oregano . you got ripped off , pal . what are you gon na do with all this ?
how long have i been on gateway station ?
i 'll let you in on a little secret , roy . in two days this entire city will belong to me , and there 's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it . it 's the perfect time to switch teams ... so what do you say ?
-- what is it .
do n't any of your little pals have real , grown up names ?
sure , that 's the right way ... at john hopkins or someplace . but how do we know there wo n't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now ? maybe we wo n't be able to get to him when we want to . maybe the goddam thing 'll erode the artery when nobody 's looking . our best shot is now .
why not ?
right , yeah --
i just though you were awful cute .
i said i did n't care .
i 'm so proud of you , bud .
fine . but i 'm bringing a couple of friends .
what restaurant ?
he 's coming , electra ! get out now !
okay .
it wo n't be that hard .
not you . you . tell me again .
what have you come up with on the riddle ?
it 's simple , you just go to the bathroom .
you better get some fresh air .
alright , listen , no bullshit just tell me straight : did you really know the guy you were chasin ' ?
stop it ! stop it , jimmy , or i 'll leave right now . i 'm not kiddin ' !
where do i sign ?
the stewardess let me keep my headphones .
huh ?
i was looking forward to this evening .
you prefer nights ?
you know , something always bothered me about that from day one , and i ca n't put my finger on it .
thanks for lying . but you 're the class officer , wick , and it 'd just be weird if we hook up . besides ...
now that 's more like it . you look a proper gentlemen for once .
giovanni , i want to thank you .
good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ?
we 're glad you people could make it , and we 're anxious to have you try out our new product . we think it 's going to be a big seller . but you 're the people that make it happen . you 're the market share everyone 's tearing each other apart to get at . it 's your opinion that 's going to make or break us .
i just wanted a little sip ? tell me , james , exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy ?
i do n't believe in luck . i know what conrad was like . do n't tell me what you think i want to hear .
let 'er go , gallagher !
yeah , among others . hey , man -- you 're hit .
how much ?
what 's wrong with it ?
give it back .
how long you worked for mr. whale ?
well , where was patrick ?
you 're insane or you think i am .
you mean if i get sick ?
you are a rich woman .
that 's bright eyes . the one i was telling you about .
here 's the scene . loretta , you 're in a trance . you glide in and get on the operating table . now tor , you 're supposed to tie her down . but you have an angora fetish ... and when you rub that swatch of angora , it makes you refuse so bela has to discipline you .
you 're playing your good side .
shhh !
`` anarchy '' 99 '' ?
gim me a break . i 'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures . is that going to hurt him ?
ah .
what ?
gon na be fine . you ask your momma .
i should be trying to stop you .
no more counting the big money for someone else .
really ? because i do n't know , i was thinking that --
that 's why she kills children .
yeah right ! ... .i do n't know , something is n't right with this place , it 's all too sterile and staged . do you ever wonder why there 's no czechs here ?
oh come on . quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool .
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on .
forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
i ca n't man , i 'm punished !
that 's probably the only reason johnson 's still alive .
oh , heh heh really ? cool . heh heh .
i have to be simple again , swana , and you may find it shockingly banal . i 've thought it over and i 'm willing to take all the consequences , even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living .
sure he will .
gee , thanks boss .
what is it ?
one moment , i 'm not done with you ... give him the file ...
oh god yes -- i 'm sorry .
what was that about up there ?
regarding what ?
but the machine worked -- that 's what i 've been trying to tell everyone ! the tape -- it 's all there , if they 'd just look at ... ... the tape ...
what does a man usually tell a girl ?
so ?
oh , tell the story .
hey , can i borrow this ?
who are you ? -- are we enemies ? why am i on this wall ? -- where 's buttercup ? --
you are very certain my dog is okay ... because you have no idea ...
how 's that ?
why do n't you get to the point .
i want to go home .
yeah .
-- uh --
-- there 's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft ? there 's no such thing ... our space program is n't even forty years old .
norman ? this is mr. eddie vedder , from accounting . i just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file i was working on . listen , i 'm in big trouble , do you know anything about computers ?
as in , your ass is dead in the water .
who buys italian meat anymore ? you think my wife buys italian meat ? she goes to the a & p , picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane , opens up a canna peas , and that 's dinner , boy .
rats ! i 've lost number three .
you got it wrong , boy . i 'm not the monster you think .
do n't be pissed . i 'm on your side , pard . i just do n't want you to do something you 'll regret . you got ta give six years to the navy if you wan na fly ... that 's six years with the most uptight assholes god put on this earth . officers are n't like you and me , man . it 's another breed .
ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked .
and cherry bombs ... ash cans ... and rockets ?
come back and make up a good-bye at least . let 's pretend we had one .
what else is there ?
because i never tried to suck my own dick ?
it is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
your mind kept wandering . that bothered me .
what ?
that 's my house .
twenty-five minutes . we wo n't make it in time .
he knows .
it 's detonation cord , for a bomb .
you should watch that !
he still having parties ?
it抯 part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
i thought of that , with the filters from the clark , we 've got enough breathable air for twenty hours . after that , we 'd better be on our way home .
have you any money ?
he 's a cop , vincent , he 's french and he 's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now !
you want coffee or something ?
look . look at that . bert schnick can see . why ... he 's ... dancing .
do n't worry it 's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk .
alright , how do you guys stand ? well , finch , i know where you are , but you ca n't use that as an excuse . jim ?
no , carter . the reason i 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong . and what the hell is heaven on earth ?
scratch the two , write in a four .
should we counsel fear -- or trust ? should we seek to destroy -- or to build ? should we meet our clients ' problems with cynicism -- or with love ?
i understand . however , our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the idaho skin stretcher .
hell , i 'm just like him .
cool . what 's it do ?
what 's that ?
you have , my son .
i know ... i know . you did the right thing .
maybe ... but you 're the one whose ass is dragging .
ok , so a has left you , b is ambivalent , you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you , i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love .
thinking there 's someone who looks like you , walking around the street somewhere . wonder if i saw him i 'd think it was you ?
i must follow the slayers . they 've taken lyssa .
yes , but i 'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet . perhaps you 'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables .
it was a boy .
that damn thing . you know how it made me look ... ?
you send telegrams here ?
'mary rooney , forty-nine . lives in arlington , still working at the hospital . ' can you get out tomorrow ? how come she is n't speaking up .
i object .
i usta be deadly at half-ball .
i -- i ca n't jeanne ... i ca n't hear your confession ... i 'm sorry ...
i could 've saved them .
then go .
we belong in hell .
hey bleek .
oh , now i 'm a bad housekeeper !
dr. zira ! silence that man !
restrain yourself , voltaire . he 's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant .
ted , all my life i 'd either been somebody 's daughter or somebody 's wife , or somebody else 's mother . then all of a sudden , i was a thirty-two-year-old , highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child . i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get . only ... i guess it was n't far enough . so i started going to a shrink . ted , i 've had time to think . i 've been through some changes . i 've learned a lot about myself .
yeah . all a colored woman wants is your money .
go , sulu !
martin , this is kind of an official meeting
i do n't know .
i 'll have my people get to work on it right away . hate the thought of the millennium falcon without her heart .
who 's your boss ?
wussup ?
gun shot .
ever done this before ?
you 've really got me confused , cage . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew ... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i 'm not following your evolution .
patrick , we 're in the middle of --
i said keep it .
you did n't like him ?
yeah ?
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf .
and this is the thanks i get . i did you a favor . you never wanted to marry that joker in the first place .
exactly where is she ?
that 's what i 'm here to talk to your brother about . what 's with him , i got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown ' ?
speak for yourself . one day ... one night ...
my father always degraded me . killed my self-esteem . and my mother was blind .
what ?
of course it 's all right , son . you had daniel webster , did n't ye ? breakfast 's ready ! i 've made a special surprise for mr. webster .
and ...
give me all your money , bitch !
you see , the one we want most refuses to cooperate . i want you to go after him again today , in the asylum .
think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . lombardo had an affair with sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place .
this looks done .
it worked for weir . prep the tanks .
what ?
well , how are you then ?
you called it in ?
my name is n't luke . it 's peter . peter appleton .
come out this way . there 's no shame in getting a little therapy ... is there , althea ?
how do you guarantee that ?
that 's intelligent .
same as always . pete takes care of himself .
god , i 'm so sure . do n't blame me , blame heather . she told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto . back me up , heather .
red or white ?
because it 's what you 're searching for . you 've been searching for it for years . i recognize this ship . i saw it eight years ago , when we made the crossing from england .
ah . one of the supporting characters .
them who ?
your leg will be fine . a lot of shrapnel came out - i saved you the pieces .
at the exorcism , birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man . you are that man , peter .
i do n't know exactly .
it is n't cheap . it 's nice .
until dallas , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
i think that 'll be fine .
we 'll come back in the morning .
you 're my friend , are n't you ?
oh , good ...
so go take your job on wall street .
it 's been stolen , walter ! you fucking know it 's been stolen !
that 's the way it was told to me .
wolfi , i think your father 's tired . i 'll cook us something here .
i brought you a special present .
yes , act naturally and we 'll split this scene the way we came in , vanessa .

i bombed . it 's either work in the office or nothing .
you know , buddy , sometimes you make me sick .
alan

congratulations . who with ?
i agree ! the only way to save our future is to unite and fight ! < b > something must be done ! we must take action fast ! my parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past ! < /b >

you do n't want to be at crossroads without one . it 's a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .
not me . i 'm not special . i 'm not exceptional . this is , though . what i 'm doing .
gee , that 's a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i 'm going to try to remember that . liberty , humanity and justice . beautiful . but you used the word 'naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics ca n't be separated ?
well , yes , compared to your other choices of expression this year , today 's events are quite mild . by the way , bobby rictor 's gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you 're interested .
yeah .
when ?
i know , we 'll be there soon .
hell , yeah . to her dumb country ass , compton is hollywood . close as she 's ever been , anyway .
shall we go to my office ?
listen , you got any reports of ... i do n't know what you call 'em . they look like big slugs , only fast .
no , no , i 'm not done ! i 've got reserves ! nadia , please please please . i 'm begging you .
it is the name of my father ... and his father before me .
... especially the sneakers .
my father told me not to be afraid . he 'd always be there for me .
three hundred altogether , harry .
about your whore of a wife ?
it never rains but when it pours --
what 's going on in berlin ?
they wo n't search you . i promise . you have n't done anything .
i 'm not 'going out ' with catherine .
armed .
now !
yes , mitotic , pupils should be constricted .
i know you will , bruce . are you going to live with your mother ?
do you ?
venice ... like katherine hepburn in summertime . . ... .why ca n't i be katherine hepburn ...
it boils down to respect . people just do n't respect the institution of marriage any more . they have no sense of real commitment .
i asked you to let me explain . it 's a long story . and not an easy one --
i know about bracketing . i read about it . the next one is going to land right on us .
no . those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and that 's over , what , god a year now .
it could mean that , yes .
i 've been here twenty years .
yes ! that 's right !
that 's great .
are you riding with me , james ?
ricky , you 're becoming quite human . i suppose we have to thank you for that , mademoiselle .
well , that all depends .
you keep going back it 's driving you insane
what was that ?
look . new videocameras . color viewfinder . image stabilization . solarization . night vision .
well , you 're beautiful .
oh , what the hell is wrong with you ? you threw a knife at my head !
not at all .
it 's not that i do n't appreciate the offer ...
you 're coming downtown with me , walter . you 're gon na come clean with me , you 're gon na name names or i swear to god i 'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate ! are we understanding each other ?
here 's your ticket , ma'am .
i 've seen them too ... the demons !
she 's a commie pig . we 're going to nail every last one ...
right , and the first time someone gets mad , their toaster will eat their hand .
well , ai n't you gon ' open and read it for us ?
you 're a fucking nut . you know that , merle ? you 're a fucking maniac !
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
i called you tuesday at 3:30 and they said you were n't in . do you remember where you were ?
i 'll show you how it was done , joseph . -- i 'll show you how they `` burked '' them .
hey can be on top ?
no offense .
i 'm thinking about it .
yeah , i 'm just gettin ' old . i ca n't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing .
these are not guys you can just go run a number on , man .
go where , ray ?
what 's wrong , did you miss me ?
do n't count on it .
god , if this is true this is like , amazing ! i kinda like it up here . can i visit you sometimes ?
and you 've checked the ram to be sure it 's synchronized with the clock .
are you crazy ? that costs a fortune !
bobby -- i have an idea . let 's go see professor barnhardt and find out how he talks .
it 's not fair ... i should be there with them . after all , i 'm the one who got the women the vote .
yes . dolores ... and even your mom and dad . but i 'll make sure you go last .
i begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle . he spent too many years in the british army .
it just occurred to me that i 've never snuck through your bedroom window .
that 's just lovely .
should i call you later ?
freshman and sophomores ...
no wonder he was looking at me like that .
certainly frank . darling , get some glasses . we 'll have some beer with frank . wo n't you sit down ?
right ... what 's that mean again ?
think about it , rob .
book . sunglasses . great .
you 're thinking : okay , there 's no want ... but they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up , right ... ?
looks quiet , y'know .
it 's up in central park , taking a leak . if you hurry , you 'll make the supper show . now get lost .
they 'll hang him all the same .
yes -- australia , and you must have suspected i would have known the powder 's origin , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 46 .
get away from me .
which side are you with ?
a woman ... so ugly on the inside that she could n't bare to go on living if she could n't be beautiful on the outside . a drug dealer ... a drug dealing pederast , actually . and , do n't forget the disease spreading whore . only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face . that 's the point . you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner , and in every home , literally . and we tolerate it . because it 's common , it seems trivial , and we tolerate , all day long , morning , noon and night . not anymore . i 'm setting the example , and it 's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed , from now on .
all right . one more shot , provided ... we 're off the island tonight .
and you do now ?
i said good night !
why should it end ? who 's gon na stop us ?
then how 'd you hear it , fool ?
... yeah .
have you ever met mr. rexroth ?
i 'm getting a doctor !
who could blame him ? were you wearing this nightgown ?
i see . clearly , such interest on their part is of great political significance .
well , girl . you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections .
he 's a soldier . he does n't need a weapon . he 's got rocks . he 's got bare hands .
i was getting hot dogs . what do you mean ?
now you 're really getting paranoid .
put that on your political resume .
what about that guy who wrote confederacy of dunces ? he committed suicide before he got published , and look how famous he is .
you serious ?
you just said ...
no .
these 'll keep it cold .
i have n't worn this damn thing in years . i just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight .
yes .
finish the inscription , idiot !
dovetails . got ta be a hundred years old .
you see , karl , growing up , only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it . he could n't really read but , well , neither could his mother . but , his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said . and she made sure karl knew . you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed , right ?
i 'm seeing him this afternoon .
yes . i told you i was your number- one fan .
dude , listen , man . i 'm cool . how much for the treatment ?
we must call the police , your excellency .
archenemies ! casanova is n't just a criminal -- he 's a supervillain . stopping him could be our ticket to fame , fortune -- and babes !
the carlton 's a dump . no cover . no minimum . and they water their drinks . it 's strictly for the fuller brush crowd .
okay -- but i 'm going to spread some common sense on the bread . lisa fremont 's loaded to her fingertips with love for you . i 'll give you two words of advice . marry her .
yes . i know .
there 's nothing there , you brain- dead cunt . think about it . there 's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything . i want you to hang the phone up , and if you call me about this again i 'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader .
okay miles .
because iris knew somebody was after her .
i just told them the local situation . colonel heffner 's in full charge now .
this is n't a very good place to talk .
really . with the porch swing and everything ...
how do i know ? but , they all got that `` witnesses for the prosecution '' look to me . probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted ... i dunno .
oy vey , i 'm stuffed .
where 's the boy ?
does n't that come next ?
and were you never ambitious , excellency ? or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ?
it has everything .
erin . it 's not your fault .
what ?
how do you explain the part about beauregard ?
what do you mean ?
i wan na let my brother know where i am .
excuse me ... i should apologize . i , um ... i ... have no great love of ...
where 's the dog now ?
you did okay , bishop .
there 's gon na be some left over for you , buddy . i take care of my boys .
you 've ...
how ?
i 'll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him .
cut the shit , sonny , and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble . he rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion .
i ai n't scared of you .
the door was locked from your side .
hi , mom . how you doing ? here , let me get you some coffee . that 's enough of that . what triggered it ?
the steering committee .
ahh ! ah !
the one that goes underwater ?

probably because it sounds scary . *
where 'd you learn that ?
free --
`` row , row , row your boat ... '' i love `` row ... '' do - do you know `` row , row , row , row , row your boat ? ''
i 'm going to tell you a secret now , elaine . simone is not a real person . i invented her .
-- usual case history -- this is n't a medical confidence , it 's all of them -- broken family , lonely , confused , crummy childhood , early promiscuity , formal prostitution beginning in her teens , income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year . oh they do n't keep the money : they get rid of it , they get pimps . why ? why do you want to know all this ?
you can help us .
too far ?
mr. < u > lugosi < /u > ! it is an unparalleled privilege to meet you . allow me to introduce myself ... i am criswell !
mother ...
< u > yes < /u > , i 'm sure .
let 's not make a big thing out of it .
i 've been meaning to ask you , mrs ... ummmm .

thank you , sera .
it 's fine .
you share a place with t-bone ?
who was scary ?
where 's my dress ? i have to go home .

i am sorry , duncan ...

it 's the only way . it 's possible your father may not be dead yet .
and some pecan pie .
you got two shirts on ?
what 's wrong with this one ?
water ? yes , we have water , we have a little in our can , we have water in the radiator which can be drunk . not at all cowardly , extremely practical . come on , come on ! there 's also a plant - i 've never seen it but i 'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid .
i 'm not gon na debate you , jerry .
i said no . want me to pull rank ?
'amen i say to thee , thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny . '
lifted it out of a guy 's cabin last night .
he never even asked . he just assumed --
right down to the kleenex i used . sir , why ? is something wrong ?
you 've led a charmed life .
what is ?
okay ... bye daddy , i love you .
then you must find out what your beliefs are .
wrong .
do n't you know i could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor ?
primitive ?
it 's fine . comfortable . i still ca n't get used to how dark it gets around here , though . when we leave the ranch , i always hold my breath until i can see the motel .
that 's right . so i wo n't be long . meanwhile julie 's gon na be right here with you .
what ?
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .
where 's our friend ?
ruins of the rustin parr house .
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
dorothy vallens ?
nick , listen . from clyde wynant ! `` will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder . communicate with herbert macaulay '' .
sweeney ! you ca n't do that to me ! not today , of all days ! jumping jehosophat ! oh , no , sweeney ... well , i suppose so ... all right . if you have to , you have to . how do you like that ? everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day .
i like your heart and i like your style . you might just do , little . lessen you got to git back to that train job .
this rae ... you get with her ?
he 's being arraigned tomorrow .
i 'd like you to leave now . is that direct enough ?
well ... so you tried riding again ?
mordechai !

yes ?
what 's the pumpkin for ?
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave . by my hand .
better'n a lion farm or a snake pit . we wo n't have to feed it !
are they any agent ?
once they digitized you , they added it .
-- be prepared .
then tell them i had a seizure .
well i hope the carpet matches the drapes .
we hit the jackpot ! let 's roll , good buddy . we got ourselves a convoy .
nick ! nick ! there 's someone to she you ,
you say the cutest things .
fuck you . fuck you , pal . listen to you trying to pass the buck again . i 'm the source of all your misery . who closed the store to play hockey ? who closed the store to attend a wake ? who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one ? you wan na blame somebody , blame yourself . `` i 'm not even supposed to be here today . '' you sound like an asshole . whose choice was it to be here today ? nobody twisted your arm . you 're here today of your own violation , my friend . but you 'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if dante was n't here . well , i got news for you , jerk : this store would survive without you . without me either . all you do is overcompensate for having what 's basically a monkey 's job : you push fucking buttons . any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs , but you 're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important , so much more epic than it really is . you work in a convenience store , dante . and badly , i might add . and i work in a shitty video store . badly , as well . you know , that guy jay 's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does . us ? we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here , just looking to pick up a paper or-god forbid- cigarettes . we look down on them , as it we 're so advanced . well , if we 're so fucking advanced , then what are we doing working here ?
this is terrible ! this ca n't be happening ! !
no , making another woman compete with someone who 's been dead eight months . that 's cold .
oh . you 're sick , i 'll humor you . so now , where were we here ? yeah , yeah , yeah . ah . oh . okay . westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
no shit .
once you been up there , you know you been some place !
you know , you really ought to get out today . you ca n't just sit around like this all the time . it 's not healthy . it 's not good for your mind . go take a walk , or somethin ' . go to a movie . christ , who 's gon na know ? you think i care ? i do n't give a shit . go . enjoy yourself . one of us should be having a good time . hello ! anybody home ? anybody in there ?
you said there were none .
thanks .

scream .

the job 's okay .
please , mister president , i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation . here is the only other camera i have left .
go breaker .
you want ... a free one .
why not ?
was it serious ?
it 's all right . i thought you 'd go back to new york like sam and ingie , and the rest of them .
i 'm sorry .
do n't i put food on you 're table ? i sponsor your training , i take care of your girl and her little baby . i even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom .
what ?
what am i looking at ?
that 's not our intent --
do n't they ? he 's down at the tombs right now .
you 're shaking .
no , you 're dead ! you 're all dead !
i want to talk to him . would you ex ...
thanks .
who do you think you are , ford ? the tooth fairy . kill ! kill ! kill !
i do n't know anything about a faction . i just met simon ... or whatever his name is ... a couple of weeks ago . i barely know him .
yeah . he finished awhile ago .

when you started noticing your short term memory loss . what < u > the problem was < /u > you and claire had in kiev ?
you ca n't go yet . we 've got so much to talk about ...

jesus , she reeks of laura ashley . oh , she 's crying . wittle baby 's upset by the big bad book .
he 's not kidnapped he 's -- he 's just hiding -- he 's just -- bennnn ? goddammit !
he was n't feeling well .

you 're gon na be sorry if you do n't shut the fuck up .
wonderful !
does this offer include my partner ?
okay ... this is it ... i 'm getting married .
gigi , huh ? sounds french -- one of those fancy ladies . must have been very fancy , if he scratched her phone number in gold .
we 're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there .
by what name are you known ?
you know how when we close up , i close the register , then you lower the shades , then i turn out the lights , then we both lock the doors .
is it a big party ? a big neighborhood party ?
listen , do you think it 's fair to take money from people who do have jobs ? from people who do work ?
they 'll recognize it 's not your husband .
he 's trying to be an actor .
yeah . pretty zany , huh ? all this shit caused by a random traffic stop . hey ... nothing means nothing . you know that . look around ... the whole planet 's in total chaos . you got ta take what you can , while you can . cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin ' .22 in the back a your head any second .
the fire 's got the temperature way up all over camp ... wo n't last long though .
what say we turn up the heat ?
i was born , in new orleans , too-
oh , well ... just my type , mrs. peel .
but he does ! do n't you see ?
oh , honey -- tell me we have n't ' progressed to full-on hallucinations .
kennedy -- never . he 'll fry in hell for what he did to me . but nixon does n't know that , which is why i 'm gon na have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him .
she called you that , too . may i ask why you 're here ?
you bet . i got a terrific hand .
so your mother grew up in shanghai ?
are n't i worth waiting for ?
excuse me .
have you seen him ?
see ya tomorrow .
if you want to see me you will not do this . you will make an appointment ...
what happened at the luau ?
forget manzetti ... . take on something simple . something you can actually accomplish . maybe he 'd be more valuable in the city .
do n't thank us too fast , viktor . you know what we have to do ?
i was saying ... it might even be possible that anna had left with them .
we better get word to the authorities and -- look !
they 're my dad 's . the lenses hurt my eyes .
well , promise then .
and she 'll be alive . up here .
merde !
some other time , cecile .
but sir , what can i say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?
she just got to sleep . do you have to tell her about it now ?
bring us an ashtray for mr. kimball , please . she whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence .
let thy soul be healed
then we 'll have to get them out the old fashioned way .
the serial killer ?
) what do you think ?
think what the play means , william . perhaps these words have a place in the real world .
nick , what is it .
if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?
how about fifteen hundred ?
whatever you need , i 'll be there .
they 'll be here ...
no thanks , i quit .
thank you . honey .
just once . 'guess i was worried we did n't have anything to talk about , since work was off-limits . non- disclosure .
we 've still got to find the mainframe .
that was two months ago . take your hand out of my pocket , thief !
i do n't know 棗 a witness . he seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony .
honey . let 's go .
guess who i saw today .
caesar , what happened ?
leaving ? for how long ?
gim me that phillips right there .
yeah , but i 'm not in jail and i tried .
no . no . it 's not like that . i 've got a husband , you know .
it 's called you 're gon na kill me . what 're you doin ' with that on ?
i guess i 'll head back ...
tell it to my daughter .
yes . they 're old friends .
true , i talk of dreams , which are the children of an idle brain , begot of nothing but vain fantasy , which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind , who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north , and , being anger 'd , puffs away from thence , turning his face to the dew- dropping south .
we 've only been over this how many times ?
mary robert .
hey ! where did you find those things ?
-- okay , g'head --
no , i 'd better not .
no , the corporate papers have to be legit . but you got ta score an i.d . a clean one . talk to suits . i got ta get us a banker .

i do n't know about that .
athos , the former musketeer , has just fought with several of your guard , at the musketeers ' gate .

in his apartment .

david lee ...

naturally , i want the best for him , money is no object .
we 'll never make it through that mainway ... i wonder what happened to sen. i 'm crazy ! this whole thing is crazy ... what am i doing ? my mind is full of so many things i ca n't think of anything , anymore . who are you ?
the rockies ... ! you 'd rather get back to that big family of yours in minnesota , would n't you ?
it could blow over tomorrow , too .
i call it like i see it , and what i see is definitely soft .
just you .
what did she do to me ?

no way .
used to run the mile , you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called ?
i do n't ...
how was i supposed to know they were women ? besides one of them was bald and kept saying `` soitinly . ''
i 'm always bad .
oh , god ...
then you can go .
yes ... yes . i think i will ...
i hope you 'll judge him by his progress here , and not his past reputation .
johnny , you 're a real jerk-off .
i was fooling , silly . you need a cigarette , because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book , and you just have one , and the match is to light it . and you need one glass of champagne . dome pear-igg-non .
hand me the 3/8ths .
i kinda screwed things up .
keep the goddam blanket on .
come on up for just a few minutes . we 'll have just one drink , then we 'll go .
i decided to help out at the asylum .
nah -- he 's taken care of .
you watch too much television .
i hate to be alone . but i 've heard all the approaches there are ... even yours .
best game in the world .
i 'm sure you should have failed .
all in . . .
they did n't have to do a thing , that 's all i 'm saying . the team was good , the best fucking team in baseball . but then they had to screw it up . they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge . a mess of porridge .
irvine ? irvine 's at home with a broken collarbone .
do you want me to be there ?
what are you tired from ?
i could , but it 's confidential . look , the point is , we did n't talk . i told her this was not an appropriate time or place .
no ! bond !
what about tipping off yurovich ?
major ? ... major ? i 'm colonel `` bat '' guano , 701 battalion .
well , i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us .
what do you like best about her ?
she did ?
uh , sorry , general , i ... i 've always had this animal magnetism , it --
thanks for your help , carl . sorry we woke you up .
shaw . clay shaw .
look . i found it . is n't that it ? cyber dynamics corporation ?
you 'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it would n't be the best thing for him . he needs hospital care . i just thought you could sign the release forms , but the city can do that . i would n't feel responsible in any way . there 's really nothing you can do . i 'm sorry .
let me drive you home .
joey 's right . janiro 's up-and coming , he 's good looking ...
yeah .
certainly , sir . it 's a pleasure to see you again .
yes -- ?
the door must not be opened . the barrier must not be crossed .
i feel a scene coming on .
yeah .
no , but at least i wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that `` one for one '' song of yours . you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape .
... yeah , okay .
ma ! ... where 's mary ... and little dan'l ?
around here ? why would they ?
what 's going on ?
the idiot ?
... back ...
all right , hard guy . get up and bleed on the rugs .
because i was n't worthy .
you are ?
only because it 's expected of her .
you 've just to love me and i 'll be the happiest woman around .
ask me what i want to change about this moment .
what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard ?
of course we do . we have to sign our taxes .
oh , i do n't know . it was an accident .
it seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband .
what will i play ?
i thought you said he was peruvian ?
lizzy !
check the eyes , ben .
you 're all right ... you sure ...
you do n't understand . i 'm just so < u > relieved < /u > . i was < u > sure < /u > you 'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy .
never cock . just squeeze .
you 're a comfort to me , henry .
what about prints ?
safety ?
no , i want to keep my room , and get another one .
suppose you could say that .
she 's on her way . with half the men in the joint . it 's only a fur coat ...
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this , harold -- the new heroes who refuse to fight . they 're trying to save the planet . there 's no time for battle , no point to battle anymore .
she came to talk to me ...
we do n't have that kind of money . how much do you think i can get for the speeder ?
i know . stop it .
you turned leo over on his face . but the coyotes must 've turned him back over , man , cuz his spirit is out . it 's out , and it knows .
did you , now ?
but nobody wants to see that . it抣l never go . they抣l rewrite you . you don抰 want that .
like what ... my favorite color ... ?
why < u > not < /u > , what 've they ever done for < u > us < /u > ... ? also : they sound ... ah , you see , this is why we have to mobilize the b-2 < u > bomber < /u > ...

scherner told me something else about you .
that my brother , my husband and your mr friedman were linked , that much i had guessed . but that my husband had killed leon ? no .
what 's the plan ?
felt his liver go on that last one . get him to a doctor or he 'll be dead in a couple hours .
i miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .
i thought she 'd get a kick out of it .
do you have any idea of what any of that means ? in english ?
an er doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
so , who is in the building ?
kill me ? well , alright . go ahead . take the empire . all yours . hell , harv , old pals . i 'll kill me for you .

your father asked you a question .

why have n't you been able to contact him ? he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago . he may be dead . zor-el but what can you , a mere girl-
just one little thing . how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson would n't get out of the forest ?
do n't bend back like that .
no , ma'am ... mama , i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is , so me and sounder can go see him .
beck , trust me . if the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup . we could be there in a few hours .

i think he hired shu to kill jimmy chin ... it was n't a chinatown gang hit -- jimmy chin and art 's wife were lovers ! she just about told me ... !
i 'm still not confident we can ride through this . some people are going to have to go to jail . hunt 's not the only problem . haldeman let me use the $ 350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments . ehrlichman had a role , a big role , in the ellsberg break-in . and i 'm ... uh , i think it 's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses .
the precogs were wrong .
the cpu from the first terminator .
i was sorry to hear about your father . i know your mother from church . it 's such a shame .
she 's saying he 's a -- a -- porco .
bettes tells me he 's doing fine .
yah , so we 're all set .
so what happens now ?
pathological states can induce abnormal strength , accelerated motor performance . for example , a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck , runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground . you know the story , same thing here . same principle , i mean .
depends on the varietal . just get a sense of it . thick ? thin ? watery ? syrupy ? inky ? amber , whatever ...
god , i hate falling asleep in the afternoon . now i 'll be up all night ... ... ugh , my back is killing me .
there is no such regulation .
what are the other reasons ?
you ? dine and ditch , right ? over ten bucks ? you 're probably looking at a thumb .
... you bring a check ?
then we shall state another time and another place . tomorrow at ten in the prefect 's office , with mademoiselle .
the hell i did !
we 're coming your way , man !
ohhhhhhhhh , how i hate you .
ahhh ... nothing .
ya love it , probie ?
in la ? are you crazy ?
thank you .
i do n't know about him -- i 'm going down to the dock , maybe go sailing .
good morning . can i do something for you ?
when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently .
superman . pretty good name for him , is n't it ?
does that make you horny ?
is that why you came up here , christy ? to thank me ?
i 've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer .
what do you get for winning ?
gee , jeff , i thought you were gon na go take a piss , not join some alcoholic nudist colony .
just what you see . a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution .
how big is it ?
otis payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life .
oh , christ , it 's true .
he 's a low-life . speaking of which , that 's your nine o'clock in there .
no , no , no : he has yet to achieve mediocrity .
waal , you c'n only get it in one shop in alexandria virginia , n'that 's where i 'm going , cause i 'm goin < u > home < /u > , f'i can get n'y'one , of that nature , to < u > take < /u > her there ...
it was for your own good , in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way .
... and ...
yeah ... ?
really .
yes , but we 're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance . three years later and he 's still classified ? they gave us his grammar school records , a study of his pubic hairs ... put it in context , bill , of what we know about oswald . lonely kid , no father , unstable childhood , high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy , joins the marines at 17. he learns russian , he acts overtly marxist with two other marines , but he 's stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate . he 's discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother 's sick . he stays home 3 days , then with a $ 1500 ticket from a $ 203 bank account , he goes to moscow ...
i was n't a manager here then mrs steckler - do n't you remember ?
no . they just try to hold you for ransom . fuck you , moses ! i 'm outa here !
yes . things are pretty hectic right now , but thanks .
yeah -- he does n't happen to know that we went together , does he ?
you got a good memory , franky .
let him have it . you 're winning anyway . it does n't make any difference .
you can oc that ?
well , there 's some flaws in her ...
fuck ! we did it !
will they die ?
shut up , james . you 're annoying . carrie and howard do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about , okay ? the entire class combined -- including the lovely hannah green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have , okay ?
mr. gardiner , i 'm ronald stiegler , of harvard books .
exactly what is your previous experience ?
i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva ... i drop the kids off , spend eight hours selling tires retail ... retail , kate .
this happens to me all the time in public .
i can show you how to use a slide rule .
open it .
yes esther .
you ca n't deny we gave the people their money 's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling romanoffs -- eight !
no -- a pride to know that i can force you to my will . i 'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor , i 've had to do much that i did not want to do . but so long as the great dr. macfarlane jumps at my whistle , that long am i a man -- and if i have not that , i have nothing . then i am only a cabman and a grave-robber .
you attract a crowd .
jeremy if you pull that trigger i 'm going to leave ! i 'm going to go to new york .
up . we 're moving out .
play music .
great , havana 's great . lots of activity in havana ! anybody i know here . five-angels ? anybody ?
so , whatever happened to her ?
that 's right . and we need more money .
then barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to liddy who gave it back to me and i put it in the office safe which was crammed .
no -- but i 'm going to keep my eye on --
what ?
come on , we 're late .
why ?
did we just - < u > hit < /u > something ?
you stupid son of a bitch ! what the fuck are you doing !
where did he come from ?
i 'm mr berlin . mr ross is right here . and mr ross is maybe gon na take a few notes , if that 's o.k. ? o.k . .. i 'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want , what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft- ernoon she left ? take your time , and nothing 's too trivial , o.k .
no - i 'll have you after
and a sort of slightly sick feeling ?
hey , sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss . but i 'm not gon na be a poster boy for him , i 'm trying to do something here . there 's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day . tell swayzak to talk to one of them .
well , listen , that 's , a nice bi-it 's a biblical name . right ? w-what does he call you ? bathsheba ?
what 's more likely , they got in the room and was just panicked , that 's all .
you抮e kidding me ...
in a lake .
appreciate the loan . i 'm good for it .
no , i like the bag . it would be good for the job tonight .
hungry hungry hippos .
well he 's taken an interest ! that means he 'll make your life hell , which i could care less about , but since i drew the short straw to supervise this turkey , he 's gon na be all over me too ! fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it 's going ? do n't worry , i covered for you . told him you were making progress and we were all very excited . i told him it was great , so now my ass is on the line . he wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow .
here 's my number if you need it ... when can you start ?
i am totally unappreciated in my time . we can run the whole park from this room , with minimal staff , for up to three days . you think that kind of automation is easy ? or cheap ? you know anybody who can network eight connection machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what i bid this job ? because i 'd sure as hell like to see them try .
oh . how long i been here ?
what if danny witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run ?
you 're already alone .
why , zeke , -- you 're just as scared as i am !
stop calling me 'sir ! i ai n't no officer . my name is byron .
no , jakie , no . i-i-i-
what is treadstone ?
< u > my hands are taped to the fucking < /u > < u > steering wheel ! < /u >
back then -- who was n't ?
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you were n't saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
that 's right , you have the right to remain silent .
mine too ?
we should do it .
counting the gray hairs in your head .
boy , you guys are really something , y'know ? i 'd like to know one thing , okay -- just one little thing . did you tell joanna she should leave me ?
neo , this is loco . they 've got morpheus in a military-controlled building . even if you somehow got inside , those are agents holding him . three of them ! i want morpheus back , too , but what you are talking about is suicide .
out front .
i 'll just be in here .
how 'd you get this from her ?
everybody shut up . listen to me !
right . here ! c-4 .
you 're a family man , frankie ?
okay , let 's see ... you can have him on tuesday the 25th ...

the documents . the photos ! the tapes ! the evidence .
thus ... .. with a kiss ... ... i die .
yah , the loudmouth . so the whole state has it , lundegaard and gustafson ?

wade 's got a point there . i 'll handle the call if you want , jerry .
you listen to me , someday you might say , `` hey ... '' no , fuck that , you just listen what i 'm going to say : your partner depends on you . your partner ... a man who 's your `` partner '' depends on you ... you have to go with him and for him ... or you 're shit , you 're shit , you ca n't exist alone ...
you know .
do n't you see how maya 's looking at you ? you got her on the hook . reel her in ! come on , let 's rachet this up a notch . you know how to to do it . here . drink some agua .
i was beginning to think you were n't going to show . that ca n't be all of it .
ho , baby !
kay . all i 'm saying --
holy mary , mother of god .
yeah ... mmmm ...
i do n't know .
you know why , do n't you ? because i am patient , chain-smoking lillian .
i hope you 'll forgive the darkness ... we 're not comfortable in the light .
what 's this stuff on the rice ?
the man following me has a walkie- talkie . if he sees i 'm not here he 'll call his partner . i do anything out of line and he 'll send the word to kill my daughter .
i do n't remember ... anyway , andy 's okay ...
no , i 'm sorry . i 'm really backward in certain areas .
the report did n't mention nails and eyes .
you 're good .
i 'm tellin ' ya .
whattya mean ?
get on with it , counselor !
i don抰 know what you抮e talking about !
i just meant --
i saw him .

yeah . how about that ? people start digging holes in this county , there 's no telling what 'll come up .
if you 're going to openly be a bitch ... .

i 'm not .
nah . i 'm ... i 'm nothing .
they kid a lot .
okay , just calm down . it 's going to be okay .
but i 've seen a ship with black sails .
the kind with the most poles .
as soon as you 've done that , shut down the communications center . lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details .
according to this , the daughter goes up to stay quiet often . you 'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend .
yeah , i 'm 'bout it .
not to speak of . peter and i were both loners . there was nobody .
oh brad , i 'm frightened . what kind of place is this ?
you 're the flower lady .
what about it ?
some decaf then ? that was stupid . obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off .
what about the tree ?
what 's that ?
they called me up to the show and i wanta tell crash goodbye .
hey . i guess there 's a lot of things we do n't know about each other .
not working for someone like dr. duval --
i was n't hitting on your girl !
oh , uh , listen , david called me up .
what 's wrong miles ? did i spend too much ?
what little old man ?
ok. listen . you : c'mere .
in case of fire , how long will it take to empty this place ?
would you take him ?
then whose fault was it , j.j. ? it was someone 's fault , was n't it ?
left field somewhere . well , bill , i want to come in from the outfield , bat cleanup like you have , learn the plush ropes --
no . somehow -- i do n't know how -- she did it .

i wish you everything i could n't give you , hildy .
yeah ? why not ?
you know how it is sometimes when you 're out playing ball with your friends ? how you 're really concentrating on what you 're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and mom yells at you ?
i 'm out .
jenny ?
would you settle for a pg-13 relationship ?
i mean at you .
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred .
i 'm warning you , mr. baxter -- this is a respectable house , not a honky-tonky . come on , oscar .
*go* anywhere ? of course not ! that would be *doing* something , would n't it ? we would n't want to *do* something . let 's just sit here all night !
alright kincaid , no where to ?
you 're asking me out . that 's so cute . what 's your name again ?

okay , then .
i do n't want to marry him . i do n't want to get married now . i 'm on the verge of graduation . i want to go to grad school after this . and then i want to start a career . i do n't want to be a wife first , and then have to worry about when i 'm going to fit in all of the other stuff . i 've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife . and i know that 's what i 'd become . sang 's already signed with a major firm , and he 's going to be pulling a huge salary , which would give me no reason to work , and he 's so traditional anyway ...
but , i ...
... brian hurt his foot .
seduce her .
not at all . i 'll catch you later .
i mean , do you have something i could show my manager ? i mean , do you have a reel ?

excuse me , lowell . sharon 's on line 3 .
for what ?
no jeffrey ! !
well , that 's it ! i may as well go and hang myself ! this sort of thing could n't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization ! that was simmons doing ! and he and jeffries always sit together at lunch ! the bastards ! ow ! perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
if anyone deserves it , it 's spengler and me . we 're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment .

thank you .
billie . you ready ?
what do you mean -- sex equality ?

what ? are you ashamed that we did it ?
well , terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience .
i came by the house every day after the funeral . and then every week . then every other month . then i stopped coming . did you even notice ?

look , it 's too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i ca n't go back and i ca n't sneak , feel back enough as it is .

i have of course observed the girl in treating her .

you 're right . you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner . since you two are partners and all . it might be a nice gesture .
no witnesses of any kind ?
there 's another guy , still in the car .
i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner , but time got away .
none at all ?
sorry about that . that 's an inch of the stuff , imagine what the whole thing 'd do .
these guys are going to take hold of you . do n't freak out . it 's for your own good .
hello marylin .
fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey .
ya see ? nothing is fucked up here , dude . nothing is fucked . these guys are fucking amateurs --
i understand black culture . i grew up around black people all my life . if the truth be told i probably know `` niggers '' better than you , monsieur delacroix . please do n't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote n word . i got a black wife and three bi-racial children , so i feel i have a right to use that word . i do n't give a damn what spike says , tarantino is right . nigger is just a word . if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i .
i 'm really sorry !
let her go ! our only chance is outrunning them !
... uh-huh ...
what about the gravimetric distortions ? they 'll tear us apart .

thanks for talking about me behind my back ... useful in court .
hello , marty , when you come home ?
let 's see ... next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we 're doomed to fail - right ... ? you hate kittens and puppies , you 've drivin all your lovers to suicide -- and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
steady , daniel boone ! you do n't want to miss ... it makes them think their medicine 's stronger than yours ...
i know what you mean ! i usually wear a big hat and dark glasses .
what is it you 're after , miles ?
not till i 'm dead , eric .
and we 're glad to have you here ...
weapons . misdemeanor one .
i think that 's the whole point .
i ca n't believe it ! but what about doug ?
he 's from kansas city . i would n't be surprised if he was your rat .

jefferson --
i said i wonder if you could help me .

i killed em ! oh , jesus ! i killed em all ! !

i 'm sorry . i do n't have anything for at least a month .
small army , from the looks of it . he put up one hell of a fight .

six months ago , bob 's testicles were removed . then hormone therapy . he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen . that was where my head fit -- into his huge , sweating tits that hung enormous , the way we think of god 's as big .

for what ? for seeking the truth ?
something was wrong .
these guys , man , they 're crazy . shit .
this water 's cold again .
... rene .
yeah . could n't find a thing . this is the way we figure it . wynant goes to julia 's apartment . he finds morelli there ... sees she 's two- timing him . they have a fight . but he figures he do n't want to do anything then ... . morelli might squeal . so he goes away . he do n't let his lawyer know anything has happened ... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him , so that julia will think it 's all blown over . then , when she do n't expect it ... he lets her have it .
i got fifty dollars to spend in your store , jesus of nazareth . can you help me or not ?
it all went so fast . he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver . i only wanted to defend myself . you have to call the police ...

you 're kiddin ' me , right ?
actually it 's not about work , it 's advice about --
fine ... except when mom was airing gage 's diaper rash , he walked away and got into grampa 's study and pooped in grampa 's favorite chair .
you seem restless .
look -- i 'm sorry -- i 've led everybody wrong . i mean yes , i get those feelings , but that 's just me , that 's just feelings . i 'm sure this will amuse you ; i 'm scared of the dark . and sometimes i get shook up , i hear people or -- well , i 'll come out in the morning and think someone 's been prying at my mailbox , or there 's a little -- trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see ? -- things other people would n't even notice . well that 's not real , it 's just nerves ; it 's got nothing to do with --
i抎 heard there were some renovations there ... no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years .

i do n't know what the hell to say ... .
she chicano , yes ?
what 's that ? only -- you 're getting too near . i do n't trust anybody .

nine ball . three ball .
is the thing -- is it over ?
the personal note is all there is to it . it 's all there ever is to it . it 's all there every is to anything ! stupidity in our government , complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you ca n't fight those things impersonally . they 're not impersonal crimes against people . they 're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue , brad , that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers .
no , i want to see the dessert cart .
indeed i did . up and down the garden she went , laughing and singing to herself .
can i come ? i 'll start a fire ...
but we ...

shut up ! i 'll not let you put anything in my hand until i see some money .

ounpoo . ungh .

you know who this is ?
honey , all the great ones came through here at one time or another .

do they go to henley hall ?
there are n't any . if the filmmakers are happy , simone 's happy . she considers herself an ... `` instrument '' .
what 's the initials 'mp ' stand for , hawkeye ?
so what now , jack sparrow ? are we to be two immortals , locked in epic battle until the trumpets of judgement day ?
god , tim lied to your ass , man . that guy 's sad , man . well , uh , i got ta go , but , uh , listen , if i do n't come back , i 'll send a video of me surfing . alright , man ? get some rest . go with the flow .
oh , she 's quite proud of herself .
look , she walked out on her own child , right ? that 's desertion , right ? mr. shaunessy , i 'm telling you it 's an open and shut case .
women have a curious taste for knickknacks . when i found out about ned -- tried to make a break -- lee would n't stand for it and -- well -- here i am !
he 's talking to you , bro . what he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization ...
he 'll be running at the quarter pole .

this is something that is never going to end . you can never work in the business again with this contract , because he will find you . to survive , you have to go into deep hiding . and that 's going to take money , a lot of money .
oh , wait relax now , let me look , let me look , come up here and we 'll have a look .
-- thank you for calling --
you think it 's possible he could be involved in the israel hit ?
no , that wo n't be necessary . i 'll be all right .
so , what 's your point ?
and no questions asked .
you think you 're going to catch him on a trace ? everything he does is planned out well in advance . the only way we 're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up .
oh ... they 're fucken crazy . that 's a snow job . do n't listen to that shit !
i hope not . now , as soon as you do what i told you , have plan-r radioed to the wing .
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for ? should n't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie ?
nothing ... that 's mcgown ... that 's singer , is n't it ? goose turn around , pay attention . what are you doing ?
the place we 're going is on the other side of that .
she 's mine !
yeah . ken said there was another guy there ... _big_ guy ... then he dropped the phone . what 's going on ?

you did . joe no i did n't . you said something first .
have n't the years been good to hattie ?
longer ? it 's getting shorter .
hey -- you let him ...
twenty-two ; same as us .
ask him if he got the letter .
it抯 a message . he wants us to know he抯 back .
-- and the fbi confirms -- what more do you need ? --
well , basically , this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand , plus he 's a few weeks behind on the vig , the interest you have to pay .
that-a-boy . hospital .
sort of . i was telling him about this great love of my life who 's name i do n't remember , and i could see ... he was getting pissed . i thought it was just because he was worried about me , but ... he told me that i was stupid because my boyfriend did n't really love me .
cream and sugar .
stop ? we 're not going to actually stop at a motel , are we ?

we 're quite a pair , you and i .
cyril did n't like it , either .

who the hell is he ?
i did n't ask him that . he 's lying .
oh ... i was just ... having a look at your truck . what 's all that wood in there for ?
i mean , it could get us both killed .
how 's it working , scotty ?
big giant < u > capacitor < /u > . and that , instead of generating power it 'll sort of be -- -- < u > sucking < /u > power , from gotham city , and storing it ... stockpiling it , sort of ? which , unless i 'm being dense , is a novel approach , i 'd say .
you 'd be killing a friend . do n't you know how much i like you ?
i could n't believe it ! i did n't think she was going to die . i knew she was sick ...

it 's up to you . air patagonia . new outfit : via caracas and bogot . no catering . four hundred and eleven pounds . four one one . good value , but refueling at bogot is variable .
i 'm serious . does n't this look a little strange to you ?
-- do n't think it could 've gone any better . tell me , how 's deb ? how 're my grandchildren ?
it 's the same thing with veronica .
i vote for the motel .

and now he will ?
no ... wait , there 's something else , something weird . i hear he 's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce . he 's talking big and living bigger .
holly and april , thanks for helping .
i ca n't see much fun in teaching school . why do n't you go into the beauty business .
honey , come on . would you like to stay in town for dinner ? maybe see what movie 's playing tonight ?
what do you want with old man faz ?
... and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours ...
the pleasure 's all yours , officer gates .
you ca n't talk to me like --
but that was n't your fault , dear , what happened to leslie . i 've told you that a million times ...
i 'm going to be at the dance .
i ca n't make it . you go on , master luke . it does n't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account . i 'm done for .
but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june '62 ?
madame . how can i help you ?
i 'll pay extra
there 's only one worth noticing .
oh no , mr. cluett , if it 's all the same to you , i 'd rather not wait . it 's about you and mrs. dickson .
are you giving me orders ?
my usual fee , plus a bonus if i come up with any results .
i 'm an old friend of the mayor 's . i just want to say hello to him .
apone ... where are your people ? anybody in d-block ?
i 'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her . that or die alone .
i 'd like to talk to you about that .
i 'm finished at three . no . squash with stan .
i wish i were . not an active criminal but ... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal . next best thing to no conscience at all .
come on , letty . it 'll get done .
you 're doing it , adam . you 're saving this town .
what about her ?
if you want to come in and wash your face - i can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
you seem the sort of person who confuses the two .
did i kill him ? of course not !
erasmus hall . that 's in brooklyn , is n't it ?
well , we 've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years .
yes , he is like a clown .
not bad , chris .
i 'm not crazy . you 're the one . you 're the one who 's wrong . you 're the one --
now , hildy , do n't be hasty ! i ca n't let him out .
i know . i know how rough life can be . and how unfair . so here 's what we do . tomorrow , on the lunch yard , you walk < u > straight < /u > < u > up < /u > to that little jerk ...
is that what you 're calling it ?
it 's what the natives are calling the lions- -two lions have been causing trouble-
that 's the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
as i remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him . must run in the family -- you would n't be runnin ' numbers out of this club , now , would you , son ?
that 's his lawyer .
how late ?
thank you . i 'm rob .
i 'm sorry , pal , but i had a meeting and --
you can wear lifts .
what was that all about ?
let 's board this up and get the hell gone . they seem to stick to the dark , so if we stick to daylight , should be all --
yes , you can make sandwiches ... .
gondorff , you gon na teach me the big con or not ?
what , do you like it here ?
no . but that 's not the only reason people get together or..stay together .
my lord ?
who did ?
smell of booze much .
we were a rebound , and we lasted six years .
i 'm just borrowing some clean clothes . i 'm not staying .
he offered to help , starling , not to snitch . that would n't give him enough chance to show off . remember , lecter looks mainly for fun . never forget fun .
all right . let 's get on it . what 'll you need ?
oh , that 's ok , a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here .
i overheard daddy mentioning her to someone . i he thinks she 's the killer .
`` ... it 's all there in the three notebooks . read them in order . if you do n't want to , i suppose that 's okay too . but in that case i want you to know something -- i never stopped loving your father . he was a very good man . it 's just that my love for robert was different . he brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before , or since . he made me feel like a woman in a way few women , maybe more , ever experience ... ''
probably best . it 'll be all business and politics , that sort of thing . would n't interest you . good of you to come .
i think so , daughter . how old are you ?
who 's doing this ?
if title dictated my behavior , as a clerk serving the public , i would n't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy . but i did , so my point is that people dictate their own behavior . hence , even though i 'm a clerk in this video store , i choose to go rent videos at big choice . agreed ?
close the door . sit down .
are you going to see james tonight ?
louise ... are we still going to mexico ?
she 's at school . we 've tried not to upset her more than she 's been .
okay . let 's start with these strange powers of yours .
marzipan ! i think you 've got marzipan in your hair . no wonder you 're homesick .
ted ? they 've set the court date . i just heard today ... it 's ... january sixth .
yeah , you were n't in that last one .
no , sir .
yeah ?
cover me , kid , while i mount .
leave him alone , peter . he 's in love .
this would be mine , sir . acting sergeant john rico . i 've assumed command on this mission .
you 'd be breaking the law .
cactus , i ca n't believe you just said all that ...
hell , no , last time i shot a corporal , cap'n miller near bit my head off .
scotty , can we make it inside ?
i 'm going to take out diane court again .
no , she 's fine .
sounds like they make tennis rackets . what do we know ?
hell of an assistant , is n't he ? damn guy moves so fast , he actually gets there before you even ask for him .
maybe all she needs is some company .
who are those girls ?
you cut yourself outside , miss ?
hold still . shit . the goddamn vein 's clotted . we have to go the goddamn hospital , so they can change the goddamn catheter .
would n't profit him none .
i still ca n't believe caitlin 's getting married .
kevin , my father needs a doctor .
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it 's not even worthy of a response . i guess i 'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .
fine .
of course i 'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- i never took those pills -- i never loved you -- we never even met -- is n't that the way you want it ?
he wants to leave things on a good note .
i do n't remember in detail , there were so many .
ah . fine . it 's good . it 's great .
mitch ...
working ... i 'm trying to figure out where to start .
oh , good . something new and different for us .

i 'm his lt. he 's my responsibility . i 'll handle it . me .
some prophet guy ?
elbow .

only asking . i did't know you were planning a comeback .
i hear mrs. swann 's quite a babe .
she 's mad .
neil , do n't leave the back doors open -- i do n't want holly near the pool .
to do the job , of course . here we go ... a crab louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars !
he 's not a moron .
uh , b ... a ... u ... no , uh , v ...
sure . no problem . i 'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious . shit , he 'll probably call out the national guard .
it 's twenty of three .
yes . god , mom ...
i start on monday .
no . you are a civilian . in china , i am michael jackson , and you are toto .
yeah , well i never wanted to get slaughtered much .
you know about this stuff ?
there , there . do n't you upset yourself --
i 'm here .
{ baffled ) i do n't follow you .
wolfi ! your father is dead .
well , whatever frankie 's got , it 's catching .
you bastard ...
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan . i painted it after joseph beuys died . a rebirth painting . i felt like he could 've painted it , or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me . the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
i never touched her .
we 're leaving .
ah , doctor 's ethics . if you knew you would n't tell , huh ?
sit down -- we 'll talk about it .
oh , kirsty ; so eager to play , so reluctant to admit it .
i 'll remember that . what do you do ?
you going to call the police ?
completely out of control .
they bombed us , we 're off the air .
just a man . goodnight pearl , sleep tight ; and do n't let the bedbugs bite .
is it stuck ?
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap .
we have n't fully identified the anomalies yet . they 're calling this whole area the briar patch ... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you . just get me data 's schematics . i 'll keep you informed . dougherty out .
where do we find him ?
major lavallette to see you , general .
lazarus ?
is your family in the apple business , too ?
what do you mean ?
the prince left him only that choice .
patronizing you ... nay , i love you .
remove your weapons , commander . and come here - alone !
fine . he 's very nice .
i do pretty good , i think . i wish i was making more , doing a little bit better . i can , t get over a certain hump . i will ... i will crack something soon i think and really do better ... i 'd like to diversify ... but i 'm doing great , i think , as a start .
i do n't suppose i can go back to the university and chase young coeds again ... pretend this whole thing never happened ...
born and bred .
so ?
yes , just the two .
hey do me a favour will ya ' . tell me something good .
why do you polish that thing all the time ?
you want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours ? you know the last time we went into something together daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street .
you in miami workin ' on your complexion ... ?
i hope you do n't mind that i took so long to finish .
what 's your name ?
did n't i ? that 's funny . is n't it funny ?
let him go .
do you know much about icebergs , dad ?
what ?
oh , my , what 's that ?
the first couple , yes , but after that it became increasingly difficult .
why ?
you go down there .
compensate !
they twisted my arm .
it 's his birthday present , and you closed the beach , honey . i told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday . i do n't believe he 'll ever do it again .
will you come with me ?
with what ? he does n't have a weapon .
no it is n't . they do n't trust the people that feel this way . but these people are right . and the kennedys are wrong . we need you to tell 'em , kenny . they 'll listen to you .
i 'm having a stroke .
are you kidding ?
paris opals . twelve-and-a-half cents . i sat down with a pencil and added it one day . but i figure , if you 're gon na be sticking something in your mouth , you might as well make it the best . ah , here 's a lost soul .
if they 're mortal , they must have mortal weaknesses . they 'll be stopped -- somehow !
you 're always in the middle of a match .
and i just liked you so much .
do n't know anything about it ? i find it difficult to believe that i 've come millions of miles --
listen , toby , i ca n't really talk right now . do you mind if i call you back ?
two o'clock , work the phones 'til you go .
dad , let 's just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .
i do n't know . hello , mom . hello , dad . something like that .
what do i do now ?
-- listen : `` november 5 , 1980. cecil stipe walked into 5th precinct . says he witnessed chin shooting , saw suspect 's picture in post . says shu kai kim wrong man . ''
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight 's story ... it does n't reveal on location of the grail , i 'm afraid ... but the knight promised that two `` markers '' that had been left behind would . this tablet is one of those `` markers . '' it proves the knight 's story is true . but as you pointed out -- it 's incomplete . now , the second `` marker '' is entombed with the knight 's dead brother . our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice , italy . as you can now see , doctor jones , we 're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago . we 're only one step away .
you mean you do n't want their votes to count , billy !
hands and knees , you say ?
from who ?
now , that 's a brilliant answer . why did n't i think of it ? our conversation could have been over long ago .
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health .
what are the variables ... ?
does sonny kick ass or does sonny kick ass ?
what , you do n't really think they left with their clothes on the lines ? photos on the walls ?
inside , vince .
yeah , you really do n't like him .
i appreciate your cooperation . i 'm looking for a missing girl ... ... this girl here , denise willis ... have you seen her ?
it 's all right . it 's organic .
i do n't know that anything could have prevented what happened .
but i 'm going to have to get you out of those clothes .
not too young to shoot a man , not to young to drink .
where are you going ?
there sure ai n't nothin ' here worth no quarter of a million .
okay 枛 what can we lose ?
i 've never dealt in black-jacks . never . everybody knows that .
you 're in show business ?
they went for someone with more theme park experience . i woulda killed for that job .
no you wo n't .
must be a fulfilling occupation .
not your name ... what are you telling me your name for ! ! where is he ?
yes sir .
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us !
i second the motion !
allowed outside the enclosed area .
mrs. raymond , this is delicious . absolutely delicious .
the coast guard has our last position . they 'll send somebody out soon enough . a ship this size you ca n't exactly miss .
uh , beg to differ .
originally , connecticut .
do as i say .
if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you wo n't stop at anything . all right , i 'll make it easier for you .
my associates did a biopsy on this man recently . he 's supposed to have a melanoma , or a carcinoma , some kind of noma . hmmm . i ca n't seem to find any record of it .
uh -- april i-i-it has an o-organic quality , you know .
do n't talk like a child . you 're a pro , now get out there and cut !
can i go to the hospital with you ?
what 's all that ?
luther always told me to bite my toenails when i get nervous . you see yourself doin ' that and you realize it ai n't worth it .
you betrayed us .
you 're a ray of sunshine , jack .
yes . i did . this morning . what i 'm saying to you : things can change . you see ? this is where you fuck up , because this is something you do n't know . you ca n't look down the road . and see what 's coming . might be someone else , john . it might be someone new , eh ? someone new . and you ca n't look back . 'cause you do n't know history . you ask them . when we were at rio rancho , who was top man ? a month ... ? two months ... ? eight months in twelve for three years in a row . you know what that means ? you know what that means ? is that luck ? is that some , some , some purloined leads ? that 's skill . that 's talent , that 's , that 's ...
and neither do you . it 's up to rennie to decide what she wants to do .
i 'm telling you it 's a forgery . the paint 's still wet for god 's sake .
a woman ?
we 're going to need everyone .
we 've discussed this before .
so -- any messages ?
she lied to me . i mean all my life , she 's telling me one story and then ... it turns out to be a completely different story . come to me at some point -- tell me the truth . no . not in my house . the truth is a stranger . and this is why ray and marcia are the way they are . marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - `` how do they find me '' she says . ray cheats on you and then blames me for it . i 'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself ... oh , man ... are you all right ?
i 'm sorry , it 's just you hear stories .
that 's exactly what i told mr. reed , but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you , miss callahan .
she died right in front of me . why 'd she have to go and do that , sailor ?
he looks so young -- when was this taken ?
yeah . maybe so .
right .
`the most interesting thing about elliot litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy , grubby and shifty-eyed . ' i 'm telling you as a friend .
which did you like better : jedi or the empire strikes back .
you 're watching t.v . and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist .
huh ... ? no ... no water .
sure , why not . give him the trophy . that pretentious son of a bitch . you heard him , norman . all that `` someone went to a lot of trouble , try again '' bullshit . and `` impotent '' . where does he get off saying i 'm impotent ? he 's a fucking self-righteous , little prick .
what about the others ?
shut up .
last two like this we had , you caught .
and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs , i would give you a good spanking -- in a business way , of course .
poor darling , and then ?
mr. belford ?
`` embezzling '' is such an ugly word , mister bailey ... no , actually i 'm trying to get a legal brief together .
i will follow you .
i know pal . i remember . twenty-nine years tomorrow .
is this a bad time ?
sorry .
i 'm just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my mind , remember ? thanks for the lemonade .
that 's it . that 's it . breathe easy .
will we see a worm ?
let me come , too . please do n't leave me alone .

who is he ?
... man !
viktor , i 'm so happy for us !
do n't fuck with me , man . you look like a clown in that stupid jacket .
did ya get the message , kid ?
i do n't know . i thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is .
hi george !
where , jimmy ?
well , i do n't mean to get up on my high horse , but why should n't we look at ourselves up there ? who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and ? and ? and who killed nigel grinch-gibbons ?
why did you help me ?
you see , madam , i am part of an international student 's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines .
he 's not a cop killer .
goodbye .
they took my keys yesterday . i went there to get them back .
no . it 's a christmas present .
you 've < u > never < /u > been in venice ?
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me ?
five years .
we took his system out .
sorry , bullshit . we have n't even begun and you 're already jeopardising this operation .
get a good picture in your mind .
is he with the girl ?
... where 're we goin ' ?
here is why this fremen has taken service with me , to ask that one question . delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer . shadout is chakobsa ... knife , in chakobsa is ... maker of death . it 's a maker ...
and maybe we could get mr. warner and mr. goldwyn and mr. cohn and mr. selznick to play as well .
nothing . it 's nothing .
okay .
which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun .
one dozen bolt cutters ! whadda you gon na do with one dozen bolt cutters ?
stop him , jessica !
hi , buffy .
are you sure we should be doing this ?
i killed him ...
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .
who are you ?
it 's terribly good .
i 'll only be a minute .
i meant , seemed like a lot of whiskey .
mmmm -- so can i ...
good lord . how 'd you get it on tape ?
how long you staying ?
i 'll take it out of their skulls .
you think i stink , do n't you ? you think i stink for what i told you ?

and you still maintain your ship did not fire on kronos one ? would you have known if she had ? come now , captain . the record clearly there were no other ships in the sector .
is there anything you do ?
i 'm ...
my experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the enterprise , this crew ...
i ought to smack your face !
any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me ... disagreeable . just ask your husband .
... yeah , and we 're working on some other interesting stuff .
magic . it was magic .
that boy 's one in a million . a real tiger .
i 'm going to get started on dishes .
you do n't believe in tipping ?
what , you gon na give it all up for a maple twist ? how dumb you got ta be ? that 's exactly what they --
did you kill this vampire who made you both ? is that why you wo n't say his name ? santiago thinks you did .
mr. gittes .
that 's right . that gives you ...
i know what you mean .
where will the money go ?
isabella ? are you crazy , man ? she almost got us killed . she 's setting you up again !
i wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
for us .
sign here and here . hey , ai n't you the folks workin ' on that whole hulabaloo from last night ?
you should give it to someone with only one leg .
well , why not do it ? there 's a job for you . get a bill started to accomplish it -- present it to congress -- it would be a great experience --
i 'm sorry about the other day . i do n't know what 's wrong with me ... i really do want to move in with you .
perform ?
ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane , but he did n't get the chimera virus .
do you remember her ?
if only we could get a fix .
what else can i do ? keeping this up is no good . he 's bound to find out sometime . at least i can save him that .
he just got accepted to the fleet academy . is n't that great ?
yeah .
as captain i am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command .
i 'm going down .
al !
heavens no . we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place .
best get down close to the moat , lad .
well , your business must not be sports memorabilia , because this one mantle card right here -- -- is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self .

the metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux . steer clear of them , mister worf ...

harry tuttle . heating engineer . at your service .
