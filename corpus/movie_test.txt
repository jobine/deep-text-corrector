sure . especially with lots of music underneath , drowning it out .
it will ?
i mean this is good dialogue along in here . it 'll play .
what 's good about it ? i miss him something fierce .
good .
and here 's a title : an apple for the teacher .
oh , you --
came on back . let me show you where it fits in .
so do i .
are you kidding ? because i think it 's good .
and do n't make it too dreary . how about this for a situation : she teaches daytimes . he teaches at night . right ? they do n't even know each other , but they share the same room . it 's cheaper that way . as a matter of fact , they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts , of oourse .
honest to goodness , i hate you .
you 're on your own . stop being chicken-hearted and write that story .
you 're tough , all right .
look , betty , it ca n't be done . it 's out .
nobody can be that busy .
it 's just impossible .
i think so . they 're on location in arizona , shooting a western . i 'm free every evening , every week- end . if you want , we could work at your place .
good for you . you 've got yourself the best guy in town .
we 're engaged .
what has artie to do with it .
could n't we work in the evenings ? six o'clock in the morning ? this next month i 'm completely at your disposal . artie is out of town .
i 'm all tied up . i ca n't .
i 'm not good enough to write it alone . we 'll have to do it together .
sorry . it 's your baby now .
i 'll make it short .
look , if you do n't mind , i have n't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school . the first time they meet ...
check .
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives , their struggles . here are people doing the most important job in the world , and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes . to me it can be as exciting as any chase , any gunplay .
psychopaths sell like hotcakes .
see if they make sense . to begin with , i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer 's sick mind .
what about all those ideas you had ?
you know , i 'd take you up on that in a minute . i 'm just not good enough to do it all by myself .
if you get a hundred thousand for it , you buy me a box of chocolate creams . if you get an oscar , i get the left foot .
why should you do that ?
i mean it . it 's no good to me anyway . help yourself .
well , for heaven 's sake !
just so you do n't think i 'm a complete swine -- if there 's anything in dark windows you can use , take it . it 's all yours .
so long .
you sure have .
sorry if i crossed you up .
it 's not your career -- it 's mine . i kind of hoped to get in on this deal . i do n't want to be a reader all my life . i want to write .
as a matter of fact . i 've given up writing altogether .
i tell you this is half sold .
sorry , miss schaefer , but i 've given up writing on spec .
i 've got twenty pages of notes . i 've got a pretty good character for the man .
i was afraid of that .
where 's the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it 's really just a springboard . it needs work .
o.k . where 's the cash ?
into something for barbara stan- wyck . they have a commitment with barbara stanwyck .
into what ? a lampshade ?
he thinks it could be made into something .
you did ?
dark windows . i got him all hopped up about it .
what teacher ?
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher .
is that so ? what 's the wonderful news ?
i called your agent . i called the screen writers guild . finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number . there was always somebody with an accent growling at me . you were not there . you were not to be spoken to . they never heard of you .
i have n't been keeping myself at all . not lately .
stop it , artie , will you ? where have you been keeping your- self ? i 've got the most wonderful news for you .
you do n't know how glad i am to see youl
hello , artie . good evening , miss schaefer .
life can be beautiful !
with a wildly beating heart .
you 'll be waiting for me ?
you wo n't . i 'll get us a refill of this awful stuff .
o.k . i find i 'm terribly afraid of losing you .
no , phillip , no . we must be strong . you 're still wearing the uniform of the coldstream guards ! furthermore , you can have the phone now .
phillip , you 're mad !
hungry ? after twelve years in the burmese jungle . i am starving , lady agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
are you hungry ?
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door ?
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta . or should we just turn on the shower ?
well ... .
as for instance ?
i 've got some ideas myself . one of them being this is new year 's eve . how about living it up a little ?
i 'm serious . i 've got a few ideas .
want me to start right now ? maybe there 's some paper around .
drop that attitude . here 's some- thing really worth while .
who wants true ? who wants moving ?
maybe that 's why it 's good . it 's true , it 's moving . now why do n't you use that character ...
i had a teacher like that once .
the flashback in the courtroom , when she tells about being a school teacher .
now if i got you correctly , there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice .
how about the rainbow room ?
is there someplace we can talk ?
except for about six pages . you 've got a flashback there ...
thank you .
i did n't .
dark windows . how did you like it ?
there 's one called ... .window ... something with a window .
why , you sweet kid .
i felt a little guilty , so i got out some of your old stories .
what for ? to recover that knife you stuck in my back ?
i 've been hoping to run into you .
thanks .
you forgot this .
about that luggage . where 's the phone ?
hurt feelings department .
sure . bases loaded .
let me help you . betty schaeter , sheldrake 's office .
so you take plot 27-a , make it glossy , make it slick --
that was last year . this year i 'm trying to earn a living .
perhaps the reason i hated bases loaded is that i knew your name . i 'd always heard you had some talent .
exactly what kind of material do you recommend ? james joyce ? dostoosvsky ?
i 'm sorry , mr. gillis , but i just do n't think it 's any good . i found it flat and banal .
if i could be of any help ...
i 'm not worried . everything will be fine . the old team together . nothing can stop us .
goodbye , young fellow . we 'll see what we can do .
you know , crazy things happen in this business . i hope you have n't lost your sense of humor ...
did you see them ? did you see how they came ?
gordon cole ... look , norma , i 'm in the middle of a rehearsal . make yourself comfortable .
and if you had n't been pretty darned interested in that script , he would n't have tried to get me on the phone ten times .
gordon cole ?
do n't play innocent . somebody named gordon cole .
what assistant ?
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants .
yes , i did .
that 's no excuse . you read the script , did n't you ?
i 'm pretty busy , as you can see ...
you 'd better . i 'm very angry .
norma , i want to apologize for not calling you .
lots of people were . lindbergh had just landed in paris . come on in .
last time i saw you was someplace very gay . i remember waving to you . i was dancing on a table .
hello , mr. demille .
hello , young fellow .
but remember , darling -- i do n't work before ten in the morning , and never after 4:30 in the afternoon .
nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible .
i do n't care about the money . i just want to work again . you do n't know what it means to know that you want me .
it 's got a lot of good things . of course , it would be an expensive picture ...
it 's a good script , is n't it ?
that 's what i want to talk to you about .
we 'll be working again , wo n't we , chief ? we 'll make our greatest picture .
we 've missed you too , dear .
nothing . i just did n't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio . i had no idea how i 'd missed it .
what 's the matter , norma ?
no one leaves a star . that makes one a star .
goodbye . norma .
i 'm the greatest star of them all .
norma , grow up . you 're a woman of fifty . there 's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five .
you heard him . i 'm a star !
that is n't true ! max ?
you tell her , max . come on , do her that favor . tell her there is n't going to be any picture -- there are n't any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself .
that 's a lie ! they want me , they want me ! i get letters every day !
de mille did n't have the heart to tell you . none of us has had the heart .
wanted what ?
he was trying to spare your feelings . the studio wanted to rent your car .
what about the studio ? what about de mille ?
no , they do n't .
that 's a lie ! they still want me !
wake up , norma . you 'd be killing yourself to an empty house . the audience left twenty years ago . now face it .
you do n't care . do you ? but hundreds of thousands of people will carel
oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .
see , you did n't believe me ! .. now i suppose you do n't think i have the courage !
you think i made that up about the gun ...
that 's between you and yourself , norma .
you ca n't do this ! max ! max ! ... i ca n't face life without you , and i 'm not afraid to die , you know .
norma , you 'd be throwing it away . i do n't qualify for the job , not any more .
these are nothing . you can have anything you want if you 'll only stay . what is it you want -- money ?
and i 'd take it in a second , norma -- only it 's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton , ohio .
it 's yours , joe . i gave it to you .
the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer .
max is a good idea . he can help with my luggage . thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe . and thanks for the use of all the trinkets .
no , you 're not . max ! max !
yes , i am , norma .
what are you doing , joe ? what are you doing ? you 're not leaving me ?
of course you have n't . i would n't let you .
i have n't done anything , norma .
of course not , joe . it 's just that i do n't want to be left alone . not now , while i 'm under this terrible strain . my nerves are being torn apart . all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind .
all right , i drove to the beach . norma , you do n't want me to feel i 'm locked up in this house ?
no you did n't . you took the car .
i went for a walk .
i just happen to know it . i had a nightmare and i screamed for you . you were n't here . where were you ?
why do you say that ?
you went out last night , did n't you , joe ?
i think i 'll read a little .
you 'd better get to bed yourself .
good .
i was a little worried about the line of my throat . this woman has done wonders with it .
good .
i 've lost half a pound since tuesday .
good night .
i just came to say good night . i do n't want you to see me -- i 'm not very attractive .
yes , norma .
do n't turn around . keep your eyes on the book .
he'a a shrewd old fox . he can smell box office . only i 'm going to outfox him a litt1e . this is n't going to be c. b. demille 's salome . it 's going to be norma desmond 's salome , a norma desmond production , starring norma desmond ... home , max .
he must be quite a guy .
it could n't have gone better . it 's practically set . of course , he has to finish this picture first , but mine will be his next .
how did it go ?
thank you , darling .
i do n't think so . it 's your script . it 's your show . good luck .
do n't you want to come along , darling ?
i know that trick ! he wants to belittle me . he 's trying to get my price down . i 've waited twenty years for this call . now mr. demille can wait till i 'm good and ready .
maybe demille is shooting .
how do you like that ? we 've made twelve pictures together . his greatest successes .
all right . give me this . i need it for a moustache . now close your eyes .
nothing is the matter . i 'm having a great time . show me some more .
i can still see myself in the line : bebe daniels , marie prevost , mabel normand ... mabel was always stepping on my feet ... what 's the matter with you , darling ? why are you so glum ?
where are your ... ?
where are my cigarettes ?
i ran into some people i knew .
what on earth , darling ? it took you hours .
you 're a darling .
pull up at the drugstore , will you , max . i 'll get you some .
they 're awful . they make me cough .
have one of mine .
so he said it quite a few years ago . so what ? i never looked better in my life . do you know why ? because i 've never been as happy in my life .
when did he say it , norma ?
i 'm not just selling the script . i 'm selling me . demille always said i was his greatest star .
i hope you realize , norma , that scripts do n't sell on astrologers ' charts .
demille is leo . i 'm scorpio . mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks . today is the day of greatest conjuction . now turn around . let me dry you .
did she read the script ?
this is the right day .
you 're really going to send it to de mille ?
i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again !
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being .
why do n't you just say thank you and go , go , go --
look , i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake . i did n't want to hurt you . you 've been good to me . you 're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me .
go away . go to that girl of yours .
great stars have great pride .
it sure would have made attractive headlines : great star kills her- self for unknown writer .
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing .
what kind of a silly thing was that to do ?
go away .
what you 're trying to say is that you do n't want me to love you . is that it ?
why not ? what i 'm trying to say is that i 'm all wrong for you . you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
who ? some car hop , or a dress extra ?
has it ever occurred that i may have a life of my own ? that there may be some girl i 'm crazy about ?
what right ? do you want me to tell you ?
what right do you have to take me for granted ?
what 's the matter with you ?
cut out that us business .
i own three blocks downtown . i have oil in bakersfield -- pumping , pumping , pumping . what 's it for but to buy us anything we want .
keep it .
shut up . i 'm rich . i 'm richer than all this new hollywood trash . i 've got a million dollars .
norma , i ca n't take it . you 've bought me enough .
`` mad about the boy . ''
what are the notes ?
i 'm in love with you . do n't you know that ? i 've been in love with you all along .
what 's that ?
is it funny that i 'm in love with you ?
a little .
you think this is all very funny .
come midnight , how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on max 's head ?
hold me tighter .
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to la traviata , all by himself . he was afraid of catching cold .
there are no other guests . we do n't want to share this night with other people . this is for you and me .
the other guests ?
who ?
it 's a quarter past ten . what time are they supposed to get here ?
it 's those feathers . they tickle .
do n't bend back like that .
just follow me .
not on the same floor with valentino !
careful , it 's slippery . i had it waxed .
should n't we wait for the others ?
cute . let 's have some drinks .
now , i 'm not going to wear ear- rings , i can tell you that .
i do n't like those studs they 've sent . i want you to have pearls . nice big pearls .
you know , to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit .
come here !
all padding . do n't let it fool you .
come on !

joe , you look absolutely divine . turn around !
you 'll need them for parties . you 'll need them for new year 's eve . where are your evening clothes ?
tails . that 's ridiculous .
of course you do . a tuxedo and tails .
i do n't need a tuxedo .
how about some evening clothes ?
why begrudge me a little fun ? i just want you to look nice , my stray little boy .
i do n't need any clothes , and i certainly do n't want you buy- ing them for --
nothing , if you work in a fill- ing station . and i 'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket , and those same baggy pants . max , what 's a good men 's shop in town ? the very best ... well , go there !
what 's wrong with it ?
that 's a dreadful shirt you 're wearing .
now you 're being silly . we do n't need two cars . we have a car . and not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit . an isotta-fraschini . have you ever heard of isotta-fraschinis ? all hand-made . cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars .
it is to me . that 's why i came to this house . that 's why i took this job -- ghost writing !
oh ... and i thought it was a matter of life and death .
i 've lost my car .
now what is it ? where 's the fire ?
ca n't you wait till i 'm dummy ?
i need some money right now .
please . now i 've forgotten how many spades are out .
they 've come for my car .
not now , my dear . i 'm playing three no trump .
i want to talk to you for a minute .
okay .
they do n't ? then why do they still write me fan letters every day . why do they beg me for my photo- graphs ? because they want to see me , me , me ! norma desmond .
honestly , it 's a little old hat . they do n't want that any more .
cut away from me ?
the one where you go to the slave market . you can cut right to the scene where john the baptist -
what scene ?
just a scene i cut out .
what 's that ?
suppose you make up your mind . do you want this job or do n't you ?
unpack nothing . i did n't say i was staying .
now , now , do n't let 's be small about such matters . we wo n't keep books . go on , unpack mr. gillis ' things .
okay . we 'll deduct it from my salary .
you proud boy , why did n't you tell me you were having difficulties .
i 'm used to paying my own bills .
it 's all taken care of . it 's all paid for .
i 'll take care of that .
you ca n't work in an apartment where you owe three months ' rent .
thanks for the invitation , but i have my own apartment .
you 'll like it here .
look , i 'm supposed to fix up your script . there 's nothing in the deal about my staying here .
i do n't know why you should be so upset . stop that playing , max . it seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together .
i 'll come early tomorrow .
you can stay here .
there sure is .
there 's something wrong with your car , you said .
hollywood . the alto nido apart- ments .
where do you live ?
the name is gillis . i 'm single .
are you married , mr. -- ?
it 's getting kind of late --
oh no . i could n't let it out of my house . you 'll have to finish it here .
maybe i 'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
i would n't worry about money . i 'll make it worth your while .
you know , i 'm pretty expensive . i get five hundred a week .
i do n't care .
me ? i 'm busy . just finished one script . i 'm due on another assignment .
i want you to do this work .
thank you .
sagittarius . i like sagittarians . you can trust them .
december twenty-first .
what month ?
i do n't know .
who ? i 'd have to have somebody i can trust . when were you born -- i mean , what sign of the zodiac ?
of course not . but it ought to be organized . just an editing job . you can find somebody .
i will not have it butchered .
it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil .
what for ? i can say anything i want with my eyes .
sure you did . that 's what makes it great . what it needs is a little more dialogue .
i wrote that with my heart .
maybe it 's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions ... but you 're not a professional writer .
of course it is .
this is fascinating .
well ?
i am not afraid . read it !
right now ? never let another writer read your stuff . he may steal it .
they will love it every place . read it . read the scene just before she has him killed !
they 'll love it in pomona .
salome -- what a woman ! what a part ! the princess in love with a holy man . she dances the dance of the seven veils . he rejects her , so she demands his head on a golden tray , kissing his cold , dead lips .
fair enough .
i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .
only asking . i did't know you were planning a comeback .
who else ?
and you 'll play salome ?
we 've made a lot of pictures together .
uh-huh .
it 's the story or salome . i think i 'll have demille direct it .
looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures .
this is to be a very important picture . i have written it myself . took me years .
depends on what it is -- a donald duck or joan or arc .
how long is a movie script these days ? i mean , how many pages ?
or teach it a better tune .
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ . i ought to have it taken out .
sure have . the last one i wrote was about cattle rustlers . before they were through with it , the whole thing played on a torpedo boat .
and you have written pictures , have n't you ?
i think that 's what it says on my driver 's license .
are you or are n't you ?
why ?
you 're a writer , you said .
yeah ?
just a minute , you !
get out !
ssh ! you 'll wake up that monkey .
you are ! writing words , words ! you 've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles , and technicolor to photograph the red , swollen tongue !
do n't get sore at me . i 'm not an executive . i 'm just a writer .
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds ! they took the idols and smashed them . the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos . and who have they got now ? some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
that 's where the popcorn business comes in . you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears .
they 're dead . they 're finished . there was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world . but that was n't good enough . oh , nol they wanted the ears of the world , too . so they opened their big mouths , and out came talk , talk , talk ...
i knew there was something wrong with them .
i am big . it 's the pictures that got small .
i know your face . you 're norma desmond . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big .
or shall i call my servant ?
sure . wait a minute -- have n't i seen you -- ?
get out .
i 'm sorry , and i 'm sorry you lost your friend , and i do n't think red is the right color .
it is not . get out .
i had some trouble with my car . flat tire . i pulled into your garage till i could get a spare . i thought this was an empty house .
lady . you 've got the wrong man .
how much will it be ? i warn you - do n't give me a fancy price just because i 'm rich .
i do n't care anyway . i want the coffin to be white . and i want it specially lined with satin . white , or deep pink .
i would n't know .
it was i who asked to come back , humiliating as it may seem . i could have gone on witn my career , only i found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me . you see , i was her rirst husband .
and she 's turned you into a servant .
i directed all her early pictures . there were three young directors who showed promise in those days : d.w. grirrith , c.b . demille , and max von mayerling .
you made her a star ?
she never will . that is my job . it has been for a long time . you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen . i made her a star . i can not let her be destroyed .
sure you are . and we 're not help- ing her any , feeding her lies and more lies . getting herself ready for a pioture ... what happens when she finds out ?
it 's just that i 'm very worried about madame .
why do n't you ? i 'm writing a script and i 'm dying to finish it , no matter what .
i 'm not inquiring where mr. gillis goes every night ...
how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark . will that do it ?
you must be very careful as you cross the patio . madame may be watching .
what is it , max ? want to wash the car , or are you doing a little spying in your off hours ?
what ?
i just found out why all those tele- phone calls . it is not miss desmond they want . it is the car they want to rent .
what 's the matter , max ?
he had a great big bungalow on wheels . i had the upstairs . see where it says 'readers ' department ' ? i remember my walls were covered with black patent leather ...
that did n't leave much for wallace reid .
you see those offices there , mr. gillis ? they used to be her dressing room , the whole row .
right with you .
mr. gillis , if you please .
she is upstairs .
how is she ?
i do n't know , sir . madame made the arrangements .
no , i have n't . i suppose all the waxworks are coming ?
i 'd better press your evening clothes , sir . you have not for- gotten madame 's new year 's party .
you send them . is that it , max ?
i would n't look too closely at the postmarks .
why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters .
we have to be very careful . no sleeping pills , no razor blades . we shut off the gas in her bed- room .
uh-huh ?
madame 's doctor . she has moments of melancholy . there have been some suicide attempts .
what doctor ?
the doctor suggested it .
how come ?
there are no locks anywhere in this house .
hey , what 's this with the door ? there is n't any lock .
it was the room of the husband . or of the husbands , i should say . madame has been married three times .
whose room was this ?
they found your car in the garage . they are going to tow it away .
good .
that 's what i told them .
i 'm not here .
some men are here . they asked for you .
who said you could ? who asked you to ?
why are you so upset ? is there anything missing ?
is that so !
naturally . i brought them myself .
i 'm talking to you . my clothes and things are up in the room .
you did , sir . gillis ' voice he goes out . gillis i pegged him as slightly looks after him , hangs cuckoo , too . a stroke maybe . his coat over a chair , come to think of it , the walks over to the win- whole place seemed to have dow , pulls down the been stricken with a kind of rickety venetian blind . creeping paralysis , out of as he does so , he looks beat with the rest of the down at : world , crumbling apart in slow motion ...
i sure turned into an interesting driveway .
she was the greatest . you would n't know . you are too young . in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters . men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails . there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings . later , he strangled himself with it .
thanks . say , she 's quite a character , that norma desmond .
there is the bathroom . i put in soap and a toothbrush .
it will never make house beautiful . i guess it 's o.k . for one night .
this room has not been used for a long time .
thanks . how did you know i was going to stay , this afternoon ?
i made your bed this afternoon .
for me ? okay .
madame is waiting .
suppose you listen just for a minute -
dressed for what ?
you are not dressed properly .
wipe your feet !
look , maybe i 'd better take my car --
go on in .
i just put my car in the garage . i had a blow-out . i thought --
you say the cutest things .
sure we believe you , only now we want you to believe us . that car better be back here by noon tomorrow , or there 's going to be fireworks .
you do n't believe me ? look in the garage .
had to get away for his health , i suppose .
i lent it to a friend of mine . he took it up to palm springs .
is that so ?
relax , fans . the car is n't here .
what car ?
we 've come for the car .
that 's right .
joseph c. gillis ?
goodbye , mr. sheldrake .
could i ? gillis , last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley . so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch . this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax . now if dewey had been elected -
look , mr. sheldrake , could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself , as a personal loan ?
there 's nothing , gillis . not even if you were a relative .
any kind of assignment . additional dialogue .
have n't got a thing .
along is no good . i need it now .
sure , gillis . if something should come along -
you trying to be funny ? -- because i 'm all out of laughs . i 'm over a barrel and i need a job .
now wait a minute . if we made it a girls ' softball team , put in a few numbers . might make a cute musical : it happened in the bull pen -- the story of a woman .
frankly , no .
of course , we 're always looking for a betty hutton . do you see it as a betty hutton ?
mr. sheldrake , i do n't want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award .
well , seems like zanuck 's got himself a baseball picture .
no , that was me . i said , who wants to see a civil war picture ?
oh , you 're one of the message kids . just a story wo n't do . you 'd have turned down gone with the wind .
get the readers ' department and see what they have on bases loaded .
bases loaded . there 's a 4o-page outline .
got a title ?
more or less . only for the end i 've got a gimmick that 's real good .
so they tell the kid to throw the world series , or else , huh ?
it 's about a ball player , a rookie shortstop that 's batting 347. the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up . but he 's trying to go straight -- except there 's a bunch of gamblers who wo n't let him .
all right , gillis . you 've got five minutes . what 's your story about ?
maybe what you need is another agent .
what do you think i 've been doing ? i need three hundred dollars .
greatest thing that could happen to you . now you 'll have to sit behind that typewriter . now you 'll have to write .
forget romanoff 's . it 's the car i 'm talking about . if i lose my car it 's like having my legs out off .
do n't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach ? once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut , you 're through .
how 's that about your being my friend ?
gillis , get this through your head . i 'm not just your agent . it 's not the ten per cent . i 'm your friend .
no ?
so you need three hundred dollars ? of course , i could give you three hundred dollars . only i 'm not going to .
okay . and let 's have the car right outside .
well , it 's one way to get her down stairs .
was theft involved ? did you catch him trying to steal something , or find he had stolen something ?
did you hate him ? had you ever thought of doing something like this before ?
did the deceased ever threaten you ? were you in fear of bodily injury ?
had he been trying to blackmail you ?
did he have a wife ? did he had a girl friend ? did you know them ?
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time ? where did he come from ? who is he ?
if it was a quarrel , how come you had the gun right there ?
was it a sudden quarrel ? had there been any trouble between you before ?
did you intend to kill him ? just answer me that .
you do not deny having killed this man , miss desmond ?
all right . camera ! action !
oh , yes , yes . they 're below , waiting for the princess ... i 'm ready .
this is the staircase of the palace .
what is the scene ? where am i ?
they have ? thank you , max . tell mr. demille i will be on the set at once .
the cameras have arrived , madame .
cameras ? ... what is it , max ?
thank you , max .
if you will pardon me , madame . the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced .
very good , madam .
say that i 'm busy , and hang up .
i myself was surprised at mr. de mille 's manners .
certainly it 's important . it 's important enough for mr. demille to call me personally . the idea of having an assistant call me !
it is not mr. demille in person . it is someone by the name or gordon cole . he says it 's very important .
now , now do you belive me ? i told you demille would jump at it .
paramount studios .
who ?
paramount is calling .
you know better than to interrupt me .
madame is wanted on the telephone .
yes , madame .
wait a minute . i want you to get out the car . you 're going to take the script over to paramount and deliver it to mr. de mille in person .
yes . madame .
bring something to drink .
the guardians will be angry . they may even send me to the phantom zone . you see , i did n't really have permission to borrow it . i must go explain to them ...
but what will happen ?
it could n't be helped . the city will have to make do with three .
but the power source , zaltar .
how can you create beauty ... with a selfish heart ? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl 's head , buzzing angrily . her look of delight turns to fear . she tries to shoo the creature away . it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city .
i 'm an artist , alura . my work comes first . other people come second .
it 's big . and empty . i 'm tired of limiting myself to argo city . i want to do something new . i 'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy , glittery stuff ... .
but the phantom zone is for criminals .
i 've discovered a new way into the phantom zone .
but where ?
you and your husband have been kind to me , alura . i have something to tell you : i 'm going away . soon .
what do you mean we ?
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl !
at last . ultimate power .
there 's no need . i learned the craft from my grandmother .
that little girl ? ha . now go on , get me some tools .
she did n't take it from you , did she ?
i do n't feel like it right now .
shut up , and get me a hacksaw .
sure glad you did n't let make a monkey of you .
is it her that 's bothering you -- or your gardener ?
no way . i 'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me .
home ?
yes . whatever i say . from now on .
whatever you say .
i think i 'd better keep it .
yes , of course , it was foolish of me .
next time , remind me to do this out in the yard .
the naming of names is not necessary . just concentrate on her face . your shadow will do the rest .
what do i do ? i do n't know her name .
that moment is now ! what good is a sword unless it be unsheathed ? use it , and no one will dare oppose you again . no one .
i 've been saving it . for the right moment .
yes ! you own the coffer of shadow . nothing can withstand its power .
am i ? still ?
you can do it . you 're the most powerful woman on earth .
that 's easy for you to say , bianca .
eliminate her .
why did she have to show up now ?
no , a super girl .
a storm dragon ?
it 's what we were warned about .
i came as quickly as i could . what is the danger ?
have fun .
he will be . in about five minutes .
is he your entertainment for tonight ?
sorry , mistress .
bianca , try not to be so bloodthirsty when you 're at the wheel . ok ?
and then , like great cats -- -we pounce ! and destroy !
we 'll bide our time and keep watch . young girls just ca n't keep a secret . if one of them 's up to something -- we 'll find out .
drive on . we have already attracted enough attention .
but which one ?
it must be the girls . one of the girls .
softball .
oh , fiddlesticks . what could be dangerous about a baseball game ?
the danger . the one nigel spoke of . it must be near .
what does it mean ?
the coffer of shadow . look at it .
what is it ?
i said stop , i did n't say run into a brick wall .
there 's no such thing as an accident . everything has meaning , if you can read the signs .
maybe it was just an accident .
it 's a warning , that 's for sure .
is this nigel 's doing ?
no problem . she can have it . i hate mountains .
i 'm sorry , but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland . you know how she loves to ski .
western europe .
what do you want ?
i do n't want much , selena . i have simple tastes .
do you want to come to argo city ?
she 's right . they 'll string her up .
i 'll come back as soon as i can .
no thanks . i have friends in the resistance . they 'll vouch for me . i figure i might get a million bucks for my memoirs .
turn it against her .
how do i fight it ?
it 's her shadow-self ! her dark side !
she has hostages .
you 've had your fun , selena , the game is over .
yes .
and you can see how you feel about me , right ?
just one kiss . for old times ' sake .
what ?
before you go ...
you 'll be safe here . i 'll come back as soon as i have the power source .
wait . do n't leave me .
i can see through walls . i could surprise her . the only thing i ca n't see through is lead , that 's why i did n't see the power source at the amusement park .
in this big old house on orchard avenue -- -but you better stay away from there .
that 's the power source that was lost from argo city ! that 's what i came : to find ! where does she live ?
i know what it is . she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle . inside there 's a silvery ring ...
there 's something very dangerous about her . something evil ...
she 'll forget about us eventually .
are n't you forgetting about selena ?
why not ? you 're a good-looking girl . and i 'm -- - available .
are you asking me for a `` date '' ?
hey , listen , when all this blows over , maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other . and maybe something might . happen again . what do you think ?
feelings are real . once you 've had them , they 're yours forever .
but what if -- -it was n't real ?
i do n't see why not .
you think so ?
and now ... the guitars are out of tune , and the words do n't make sense , and somebody unplugged the mike ...
and now ?
what i had before . what 's not there now . it 's like i woke up and found part of me was n't there any more : something that made me feel really alive and aware of things . it was like , for the first time in my life , everything fitted together perfectly -- -you and me and the world around us -- like we were a wonderful song ...
miss what ?
i know i was acting funny -- -i 'm sorry . it 's just ... i miss it .
it seemed that way to me .
i 'm not mad at you .
hello . are you still mad at me ?
hi .
but i do n't understand .
that makes it worse .
i sort of like what you said .
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said .
but why ?
away . from you .
like turning off a light .
just like that ?
i do n't love you any more .
what would n't last ? what 's the matter with you ?
she said it would n't last .
ethan -- -when i said 'a while ' i meant a couple of hours .
great ! i'ii build a house -- right over there , with a veranda looking out to sea . and i 'll plant a garden ! papayas , pineapples , bananas , mangoes -- - anything 'll grow here . and i'ii fish in the lagoon , and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe , and -- -
you ca n't just abandon me . alone .
but i have to go back . i brought you here so you 'd be safe . from her .
it 's paradise . we could be very happy here .
i thought i 'd show you one of my favourite places .
terrific .
is this how ?
well ... i guess one is all right .
if we wait until we understand everything we 'll be dead . come on . you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school .
of course not , but ... there are things we do n't understand .
you 're not afraid are you ?
no .
let me kiss you .
what 's that ?
there 's one sure way to find out how you feel .
what do you feel about me ?
of course i do n't hate you . i do n't hate anyone .
you do n't like me ? you hate me ?
all this talk about love , it 's silly .
just give me a chance to show how much i love you . love changes everything . love makes everything possib1e .
we 're from different worlds .
why not ?
we ca n't do that .
i 'll be safe with you . we can stay together the rest of our lives .
but be reasonable . if i do n't do something to stop her she 'll try again . and maybe hurt you .
i do n't want you to go near her . she 's bad news .
tell me where i can find her .
let 's talk about us , not her .
ethan , tell me more about this woman who 's after you .
i used to work here summers when i was a kid .
come on , let 's ride .
it 's not important . the important thing is i 'm here to find something and i think you can he1p me .
i 'm sorry , i do n't understand .
no . argo city . it was on a chunk of rock that was part of krypton once -- -but we moved it to inner space .
where superman 's from ? krypton ?
yes . it reminds me of home .
like it ?
they do n't care , they 're tearing it down for a shopping centre .
are you sure it 's all right for us to be here ?
this is my favourite place in the city .
i know just the place . hang a left at the amalgamated tower .
we have to have a long talk about all this .
my angel . my goddess . i feel i 've always loved you all my life . i 'll die if i ca n't spend the rest of my life just looking at you , holding you in my arms ...
you love me ?
that woman who 's after me . she hates you . because she knows i love you .
who did n't ?
you 're alive ! she did n't kill you !
relax . tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream . goodbye .
when can i see , you again ?
i have to .
do n't leave me .
later .
let me out . i have to talk to you .
i 'm taking you to the hospital .
what 's happening ?
it 's for your own protection .
wait ... do n't leave me in here ...
well thanks a pile , fella .
i did .
hey , i thought you were gon na mention us upstairs .
i 'll mention it upstairs .
can you get us out ? it 's all a misunderstanding . we thought they were selling hamburgers in that place .
a little .
remember me ? we were in a disaster together .
hmmm ?
hey ! ethan !
that one was for you . but i thought i 'd wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here . i 'd hate to lose you , ethan .
why the empty cage ?
i 'm ready for her . i 'll show you .
well ... i guess i ca n't .
you ca n't put her out of your mind , is that it ?
supergirl ?
you 're a regular einstein , are n't you ?
i do n't know . you seem afraid .
guess ! go on .
yeah .
they want me . does n't it make you proud ?
careful , do n't make me angry . i start fires when i 'm angry .
you vicious --
you 've been without water for a whole day . let 's see how thirsty you get in a week .
go on , talk big ! i 'll soon have you purring like a kitten .
if that worked , you would 've done it already . no , you want me to drink it of my own free will . well let me tell you , sweetheart , it 'll be a cold day in hell before i fall for that one again .
i could force you .
i 'm wise to your tricks , lady .
i never met a man i could n't have -- and you 're no different from the rest !
no !
come back to my house . my car 's outside .
i do n't want your help .
this is your problem , right here . this girl 's driving you insane , ethan . let me help you .
nurse ! help !
do n't think i 'm weak , just because i 'm a woman . i have power . give in , stop fighting me , ethan . i always get what i want .
nurse !
you ca n't escape from me that easily . i 'm afraid you do n't know who i am .
nurse ! nurse !
forget her , you 're mine . i saw you first .
but she is real , it was n't just a concussion .
yes , yes i saw the whole thing . how could you be interested in that puny little girl ?
it 's the truth . in twenty-four hours you 'll forget all about that girl .
why should i believe you ?
this `` love '' of yours will soon wear off . i gave you a temporary love potion .
i know it .
and you think you 're in love .
they think i have a concussion .
what an adorable hat .
oh no , not you again .
i 'll drink to that .
to us . and to the seeds we 'll plant together .
well , just one .
a passionfruit smoothee .
what is it ?
oh , you know how parties are . always some damage .
what 's that big black scar on the ground ? like a fire .
i bet they do .
i have a lot of repeat business . people seem to like my service .
you must be very popular in the neighborhood . i always see your truck parked around .
come in , have a drink , we 'll talk .
well , there 's several ways to go .
finished your estimate ?
call me next week . maybe we can have lunch .
what about my proposal ?
i 've got things to do .
hey , where you going ?
george -- -i thought you 'd never ask .
marry me , selena . the hardware store does n't bring in much now , but ...
why george , are you proposing ?
selena , i 've been thinking . it 's time i settled down -- -and i do n't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you .
better eat it quick . it wo n't look too pretty when it 's all covered with ants .
you sure are a good cook , selena . man , that looks too pretty to eat .
the scoop of the year !
yes .
say -- -you think that 's the same guy who was in the accident with lucy ?
someone 's chasing him .
it 's no trouble . i 'd like to ask you some more questions .
oh , no thanks .
can i give you a lift ?
well , lucy , it 's nice to see you 're feeling better . nice to meet you , jimmy .
gosh , what do you suppose .that is ?
i knew it ! he 's working on a hot scoop !
he 's off doing a top secret uh , investigation .
where is your cousin clark , by the way ?
can i quote you ?
i believe there 's a rational explanation for everything . but i do n't know what it is .
how lucy and that guy got to the hospital . and all that damage at the school . the police are calling it a freak tornado . i 'd like to interview you for the daily- -
theories ?
do you have any theories about last night ?
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you . lucy 's told me all about you . your cousin clark taught me everything i know about the newspaper business .
you 're supposed to guess .
why did n't you tell me ?
you bet your ass .
you were ? you mean we could 've been ... you-know-what ... all this time ?
remember ? i was trying desperately to get you 're attention .
i 've been in love with you for years . remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom ? and put your fingerprints on my lens .
i heard stories . i do n't think you wan na know .
i wish they 'd tell us what they 're going to do with us .
i sure wish superman was around . he would n't let any of this go on . not for one minute .
lucy ! be serious . we could be executed for treason !
i ca n't help it if men notice me .
did anybody notice you ?
i saw them dragged out of the administration building .
how do you know ?
i had to dump the papers in a trashcan . the danvers have been arrested !
oh , sure .
jimmy , would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die ?
-- planet . i mean , you were there . do you think it was natural , or like some people are claiming , supernatural ?
oh , jimmy , ca n't you forget about your career for one second ?
as brave as my father . as wise .
be brave , my .daughter . be wise .
why have n't you been able to contact him ? he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago . he may be dead . zor-el but what can you , a mere girl-
superman will return it .
i allowed it to escape the city .
years ago . and it was zaltar who stole it .
it was my fault we lost the power source .
but kara , no one has ever gone from here to earth . the journey is dangerous .
i am almost an adult . this is what i want .
it was my fault . you are n't old enough to use the wand . i should n't have given it to you .
i 'm sorry ... i did n't know .
can you create life ?
you see , a tree is a living thing .
wait till you 're older . here -- watch this .
i do n't understand .
even i have trouble with that sometimes . earth is in outer space . and we 're in inner space .
yes , i know the equations -- -i just ca n't see it in my head .
did n't you study six-dimensional geometry in school ?
where is earth ?
it 's something they have on earth . you know , where your cousin went .
what 's a tree ?
it 's going to be a tree , i think .
what are you making :
again ? you 're getting real tight with them . you 're gon na be a straight-a student -- -just kidding , thanks for coming .
i have to get back . i 'm having dinner with the danvers .
you 're not gon na stay for the ice cream ?
nice ? he 's cute enough to melt lead !
he 's nice .
listen , i know i 've been saying you ought party more , but keep your hands off this one , will yak ? he 's private property . i 've been waiting years for him to develop .
mr. danvers called . i 'll get a new one with the insurance money . b.f.d .
i 'm afraid i have some bad news about your car .
somebody 's got ta do something ! !
lucy ; come back !
i dunno , but he 's gon na get creamed .
why is he acting so strangely ?
please , as a favour to me ? so i wo n't be the only girl ?
it does n't seem right .
go back , sign in , and climb out the bathroom window . mccloskey 's always zonked out : she 'll never hear you .
oh , i do n't know . i 'm not signed out for an overnight .
linda babes ! there 's this all-night party at eddie 's ... his folks are away ...
you sure ?
no thanks . you go on .
it was just a trim .
your hair looks the same .
she just hates anybody who is n't afraid of her .
but what for ?
keep an eye peeled for myra . she 's out to get you .
must 've been a defective puck .
how 'd you do that ?
she 's a beast .
she did that deliberately .
thank you . you 're very kind .
oh wow , i should 've known . me and my big mouth . listen , you can borrow any of my clothes you want . any time .
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth .
you 're not ... an orphan are you ?
i 'd rather not talk about it .
since what ? ? did you have a fire at your house or something ?
i have money to buy more , but i have n't had a chance since ...
this is all your clothes ?
there is n't any .
no sweat . when 's the rest of your stuff arriving ?
i can do that .
sure . mate in five moves .
what ? me ?
thank you both so much . it was a lovely lunch , mrs. danvers . i had a wonderful time . and you 're a terrific chess player mr. danvers .
i 'd love to .
ca n't have you moping around the campus . why do n't you come home with us for dinner ?
no , mr. danvers .
no plans for the weekend , linda ?
here it is . oh ... of course . you 're the orphan . i 'm so sorry about your parents . we 'll try to make you happy here .
i mean , it would probably be there , if you received it .
i 'm linda lee .
what can i do for you ?
oh , yes . knocking . the pre-entry signal . i forgot .
do n't you believe in knocking ?
nonsense .
why get rid of her at al1 ? you 've used the coffer of shadow too much . it is beginning to rule your heart .
maybe you 'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself , nigel ?
you would ! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power .
which of you is willing to make that sacrifice ?
we are in great danger . a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft .
you better have a pretty good explanation for this , selena .
such a shame . you ought to take better care of yourself .
nothing 's wrong with my skin .
i was just thinking , if i had your skin problems , i 'd use a good tannisroot ointment . every night .
... trust the wisdom of the ancients , trust the great mother to protect us ... why . are you staring at me like that ?
i could teach you a thing or two now .
you used to listen to me . when you asked me to teach you something of the craft .
you 're wasting your breath .
i have to talk to you .
nigel , get lost .
throw him out .
you think you are on top now . well there is someone coming to challenge you . i saw it in the cards this morning .
you scorpios can never take a joke .
balefire on you , selena !
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower . now burn rubber .
you need me , selena . i 'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate .
nigel , get out of here . and do n't come slithering back . nigel shakes his head .
cigarette ?
bianca 's taught me all ! need to know . i 'll be safe , as long as i do n't go too far .
you 're going to pay a terrible price . the power of shadow is tricky . use it too much and it takes over .
i just did . because i have the power .
you 're not going anywhere . except back to nowheresville . you 're too impatient , selena . look around you -- all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship . some of their families have been in the craft for generations . you ca n't join and take over our whole organization in a few months .
i have plans nigel . you could come with me ... i 'm going places .
it may well be . i know how you won that election selena . you ca n't fool me .
cheer up , nigel . it 's not the end of the world .
that 's home .
yes , i see it . shining like a jewel .
they 'll be grateful . if you had n't found it , it would still be lost . look , up ahead .
it 's everywhere . but water is always the door .
where is inner space ?
sounds o.k . to me . let 's go .
it 's the most beautiful place in the universe .
what 's it like ?
your nightmares are over . i 'm taking this back to argo city where it wo n't be misused . you could come too . it might be safer for you .
ever since i found that thing i 've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare . you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time .
for what ?
i 'm free . i can never thank you enough .
not yet .
you 've run out of things to throw , selena .
it 's just one more crime you 'll have to pay for .
the danvers . and two of your little friends .
cheap but effective .
a cheap trick .
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while .
i do n't scare that easily .
i am selena . give him to me . now . or you 'll both be sorry .
who are you ?
thank you . i 'm going to close this up again .
that was meant for me !
zaltar !
goodbye ...
too late . too late . save yourself .
zaltar . use the wand !
it 's selena . i 'm getting so i can recognise her work .
yes , must n't stop .
do n't stop . keep moving .
what 's that ? never saw anything like that .
better than when i was a child .
you can use the wand .
not doing this for you . just sick of this place , that 's all . wretched singing sculptures , always yowling at you . boring !
i heard my mother ask you once `` how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty ? '' she was wrong , zaltar , you have a generous heart .
going to try . did n't say i could .
you 're going to take me back ?
please . i have to get back to earth . my friends are in trouble . and unless i bring back the power source , argo city will die .
superpowers . got you in a lot of trouble , did n't they ?
you could do anything . you could sculpt mountain ranges ... draw with rainbows ! you 'd have superpowers .
leave the zone ? what would i do on earth ?
then come with me .
takes a long time , you know , learning the wand . just begun to understand it myse1f . give things a kind of life -- can also take away life ; works backwards too . besides i ca n't let you take my wand . only have the one , what would i do ? i 'd be helpless . it 's out of the question .
no , it 's no good -- -you ca n't practice -- - you only get one go . a thing like that . no . sure you do n't want a sip of this ? it 's delicious , i think .
then teach me how .
no , it would n't work , you could n't , it 's too -- - if it did n't work you 'd be swept into a singularity -- - no , you 'd never make it . forget i mentioned it .
why ?
but it 's impossible .
i knew it !
there is a way .
no , that 's not true -- -there 's well ... no --
if there 's a way in , there must be a way out .
there 's no way out of the zone . no one 's ever escaped . that 's why they send the criminals here .
help me to get back to earth . where my friends are . they need me .
of course , my dear . what can i do ?
zaltar , please help me .
told you . would n't listen to me . knew it would make you sad .
that horrible woman !
the phantom zone overlooks everywhere.. if you have the right tools .
you look at them ? how ?
but what about other people ? do n't you miss them ?
what kind of a question is that ? of course : i am . i do whatever i want . all the time .
are you happy , zaltar ?
no , no . not lovely . 'perfect ' . did everything just right . nobody telling you to change this , move that around . please yourself . that 's the secret of happiness .
it 's lovely . . .
just feels , a little , like a tiny bit of argo city ...
what ? palace ? hardly .
... mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam ... ''
criminals .
others ?
well , nothing we can do about it . come into my house . you can stay with me , until i build you your own place . i expect you wo n't want to mix with the others -- not our type of people .
i know .
it 's dangerous to use a power source on earth . it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces -- -
... but the person who has it . tricked me , and sent me to the phantom zone .
shouldnt 've done that .
yes . i went there to find the lost power source ...
earth ? you crossed the dimension barrier ? by yourself ?
i was on earth ...
this is the phantom zone . but why did you come here from argo city ?
what is this place ?
nope . never .
man , you do n't never pass out , do ya ?
hey , man , that 's a great name for a cocktail !
no , no , on the football field . they called me ... ... the smallville flash .
brad ?
hey ! y'know what they used to call me in high school ?
brad is not a good name for a cocktail .
brad .
got vodka in it now . got ta give it a new name . hey , listen , you thought it up , we 'll name it after you . what 's your name ?
what ? what did you tell me ?
aha ! what 'd i tell ya !
there 's no vodka in it .
not enough vodka in it .
sling . singapore sling . what 's wrong ?
s'not bad , s'very good , but ... y'know what 's wrong with this ... singapore ... thing ?
tuesday ! i got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting ! !
tuesday .
roebush ! that 's the guy ! buddy , he 's gon na nail our behinds to the wall ! this is special order ! he said he had to have it before ... omigod ! ! what 's tomorrow ?
mr. roebush ?
good lord , fella ! i 'm talking about your boss .
what are you talkin ' about ?
first the supplier could n't find the invoice . then the order came up short . then i missed the four o'clock plane from cleveland and had to rent a car , and then i got a darn flat tire on the highway ! can you beat it ? boy , your boss must 've been furious when i did n't show up by the end of the day today , huh ?
what ?
buddy , are we in trouble .
yeah ? what do you want ?
the kid will do fine on his own . give it your best shot , ricky !
the kid needs a man to show him --
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids .
for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team , you sure got a big mouth , kent .
say , brad . i think he 'll be better off doing it his way .
a natural athlete can play any sport . any sport .
uh , no , i did n't know that , brad .
all the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol ' champ here . kent , i bet you did n't know i won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row .
i seem to be .
hiya , sweet thing . little guy 's getting ' hassled , huh ? kent , you still here ?
hiya , kent , long time no see . not that you ever could . `` see '' i mean , hahaha !
brad wilson .
here i am , honey , and i 'm all yours . remember when you were queen of the prom ? all the guys had to wait in line to get a dance . but now there 's only one name on your dance card , sweet thing , and it 's --
anyday ...
but if you would n't mind settling for me --
i guess he misses a lot of dinners .
well , he 's going to get the best home-cooked meal he 's had in ... in a long time . you tell superman we think he 's wonderful .
no , well in this case i think i can speak for him . i mean , i 'm pretty close to him , you know . superman will be there on wednesday .
me too . that 's why i put this one up .
gee , i always loved porch swings .
lana , i 'm from metropolis . i see superman every day .
well , are n't you excited ?
uh-huh .
he really was !
can i help ?
the dog 's always doing that . and the car 's always doing that .
oh , i would n't want to -- i mean , i 'd want to , but i would n't want to ... be a nuisance to you .
call me .
no , what you said before , could i make it in metropolis ? i 've dreamed about it , sure , but i never really thought about it . what would i do when i got there ?
ride a thresher ? well , i do n't know . girls are trying just about everything now but --
that 's the biggest change in smallville , you know . they 've taken over this town . everybody who is n't actually working for wheat king -- like i do -- is out there -- on a wheat king thresher . do you think i could do it ? do you ?
no . i mean , yes they are , but i was talking about that . wheat king . bet your bottom dollar that 's a wheat king thresher .
old ties are hard to cut .
i can never get a way from it .
you know , i was just thinking , lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in metropolis --
so ... how much longer do you think you 'll be in smallville --
me neither ...
gee , i have n't laughed like that since -- since -- i really ca n't remember when .
pate ? what pate ? i did n't make any -- oh , no , clark . that 's buster 's dog food .
well , this pate is rather ... unusual .
no , i mean ricky . he 's not interested in any of this stuff .
no , thanks .
peanut butter and jelly .
i meant all the choices here . all this -- -- cole slaw , guacamole -- this is some picnic !
no , all the good ones are married . that 's why brad thinks he 's god 's gift to women . this woman anyway . he 's single . he wo n't take no for an answer , but he 's the only one who 's asking . and he knows it .
there 's a lot of choices here .
and even nicer when there 's a man around , which is n't all that often .
i 'm talking about salt . oh , go ahead , pour it on , relax . that 's what picnics are for .
me ? ?
clark , i think you worry too much about mayonnaise .
well , it 's true you have to be careful things do n't spoil , especially with mayonnaise or cream .
some people do n't think it 's healthy .
gee , i have n't done this in years .
i mean him .
but all he had was chocolate milk .
it is n't only that he 's small for his age . how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father ? look at him , he 's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon .
hey , he 'll be all right . believe me lana , i know . i was a late bloomer myself .
i just ca n't stand this .
i thought `` clark kent has a really nice voice . '' you did n't even know i was there .
you thought that ?
that song . i remember one day i came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano . and i thought -- what am i going to do with all this potato salad ?
oh ... i came close once .
you ... um ... you never got married ?
ricky . my little boy . at least here we 've got a house . and i 've got a job . okay , i 'm only a secretary , oaky , but it pays the bills . except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up . i even had to pawn my diamond ring then .
who ?
that 's easy to say . but how ? and what about ricky ?
but lana , you could --
no , the problem is -- why do i stay in smallville ? believe me , i 've asked myself the same question . do you know how lucky you are to live in metropolis ? the big apricot .
i did n't --
mayonnaise ? donald loved mayonnaise . why would you think that was the problem . ?
too much mayonnaise ?
you know what 's the problem ?
there must be a gallon of potato salad left over .
it sure is .
and three years after the royal wedding , the king abdicated . is n't that terrible ?
the streamers ? they 're no problem , you just pull on them and --
you 'd be surprised how many offers i did n't get . even brad would n't stick around for this . it really is n't easy .
sure , lana , i 'd love to .
i ca n't clark already asked me . did n't you ? he used to love this song . did n't you ? so he just said -- `` would you dance with me ? ''
for reminding me , i mean . can you follow me ?
you 're welcome ... ? ?
and here i am , just standing here . that 's terrible . thank you .
you should n't say that , you 're the chairman -- ... uh , chairperson ...
you always did . can i give you a hand with that ?
you look wonderful .
clark .
lana lang . how great to see you .
i 'm sorry , mr. white , but i 've got an errand to run .
kent !
uh ... excuse me , folks ...
oh . you 're going away .
-- but you deserve the vacation , lois .
let me do it for you , mr. white .
i 'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this .
look , i do n't know , kent . . . clark personally , i think it could be a terrific story !
mr. white , please , i promised those people i 'd get back to them by this morning . what do you think ?
please , kent , not now . i 'm trying to put out a newspaper here .
hi , lois . morning , jimmy , you 've got mustard on your lapel . excuse me , mr. white , i do n't mean to interrupt but -- -
actually , that 's why i stopped by . he 's realy sorry , he wanted to make it , but then he ... ran into a problem .
hi . mister kent . guess who mom 's having dinner with tonight ? superman !
could you get me superman 's autograph ?
sure .
mr. kent , could i ask you something ?
we get together sometimes .
do you really know superman ?
what !
mr. kent ! superman was here !
mom and i do this all the time .
well ... not quite like this .
oh ?
gee , i 'm sorry , lois . but i 've already got a lunch date . with mr. white 's new secretary .
i 'd better be . suddenly i 've got competition to keep up with . your high school reunion article . i though it was terrific . and fascinating . especially about the girl back home . i 'll tell you what , clark , i 'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it .
you 're the best , lois .
exactly what i was about to ask about me .
so , mr. white ? can i go ahead and make my travel arrangements ?
take me , for instance . going back to middle america after having become a metropolis sophisticate --
say !
anyway , the reunion 's just the hook for the story . what it 's really about is how the typical small town 's changed in the last fifteen years . how do you like this a title : can you go home again ?
you know what mr. white said . a photographer always goes after a story .
what are you doing ?
keep talking to that state trooper so he does n't notice where i 'm going , okay ?
at one o'clock in the morning ?
wow , what a beautiful sunrise !
what 's that ?
the thing is though , my cousin arnold , aunt rosey 's arnold this is , he got mad when uncle al insulted his mother 's stuffing , so now the problem is --
mmmmm . . .
but my uncle al , on my father 's side , he wo n't eat her stuffing , he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey . so my mother told my aunt ellen . . . aunt ellen 's my father 's half-sister , i told you that , right ?
i would n't know mr. kent . most of the people i went to high school with are still in high school .
it 's practically an american ritual , mr. white ! is n't that so , jimmy ?

what about this week 's check ?
you are , i was about to say , no longer eligible .
do n't call me a bum ! i ai n't no bum !
thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment , thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens . do you know what you are ?
i know , i 'm the fault .
mr. gorman , the city of metropolis is generous to a fault , but . . .
man , them people was crazy ! how they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day ? `` hold the pickle ! hold the lettuce ! extra onions ! special sauce ! no special sauce ! '' ai n't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet .
the only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint -- -- which lasted . . . 28 minutes ! well ! that 's some kind of record . talk about fast !
well , it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen japanese jobs .
a television set ?
they said i lost it on the subway , but it ai n't the truth ! it was a pickpocket took it !
not counting this week . you secured employment last june as a messenger and were discharged after one day for . . .
thirty-five .
mr. gorman , according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks .
nope , but --
dishwasher ? any luck ?
kitchen . . . technician
what kind ?
yeah .
ah yes , august gorman . have you looked for work this week , mr. gorman ?
gus gorman .
name ?
say who ?
the boss wants to see you .
say what ?
gus ?
yeah . a raise . .
workin ' overtime ? what are you doin ' , buddy , looking for a raise ?
uh . . . no , man . i got some work to finish up here .
quittin ' time , gus . comin ' ?
one . and a half .
how many sugars ?
they 're just . . . floating around out there . the computer knows where .
so where is all them half-centses ?
no , not really . they ca n't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could .
who gets it , the company ?
they do n't actually lose 'em . you ca n't lose what you never got .
what 'm i gon na do with half a cent ? buy me a thoroughbred cockroach ? everybody loses them fractions ?
actually , it 's probably more like $ 143.80 and one-half cent . there 's always fractions over in a big corporation , but they round it down to the lowest whole number .
i ai n't gon na live that long on $ 143.80 ! i want it now , man , while i 'm still young and cool .
that 's so you 're still getting some money when you hit 65 .
first rip-off , man ! supposed to be 225 bucks a week ! you know what this sucker says ? ? $ 143.80 ! federal tax ! state tax ! social security tax !
first paycheck ?
sonofagun ! look at this here !
join the party , genius ! come on up !
awright . i got me my electric train , mama . i finally got -- hey , what y'all doin ' up there ? !
ca n't wait , pal , ca n't wait .
you want to mess with superman ?
man , all it got to do is find their weak spot . you bet on the machine in any fight you name , you gon na win your bet .
remember , gus . a machine does n't want anything except to keep on being a machine . you 've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent .
yeah , sure . ai n't nobody gon na stomp my electric train ...
can you do that ?
ai n't nobody gon na mess with my machine ! i 'll ... i 'll ... what will i do ? i 'll build in a counter-punch ! anything attacks it gets counter- attacked ! and wiped out !
but a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies . people who will want to destroy it .
exactly . stoned mother .
stone mutha .
gus , it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here . we are talking unlimited power . we are talking `` get-down hot-cha daddy-o '' whatever you called it .
i told you it was n't no jive .
it looks wonderful . it is wonderful , let 's face it .
yeah ? how 's it look ?
tell me more ...
anything .
what will it get me ?
everything .
what will it do ?
i invented it , man . in my head . it 's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-sunday super mutha computer .
you designed it ?
not like this one you ai n't . nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it do n't exist yet . we got to build it .
we 've already got some .
a computer .
for what ?
a waste-basket ? gus those are plans . blueprints .
what do you want ?
fair 's fair .
is this whitemail ?
do n't be getting ' racist with me , man .
is this blackmail ?
do n't lay that jail number on me no more . you need me out here doin ' stuff for you more'n sitten ' in no jail doin ' nothin ' for nobody . 'sides , i be known ' some heavy stuff about you now . you do n't want em spillin ' the coffee beans .
i should think a taste of freedom is enough , do n't you ? or would you prefer jail ?
now ... when do i get a taste ?
the moon ! listen , man , when i was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for christmas . my mama did n't have barely enough to pay the electric bill , let alone buy me no train set .
i knew it , i knew it , go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon !
lookit , you 're getting ' what you want all the time . it ai n't right that i do n't get somethin ' ! i never get somethin ' !
thanks , kiddo . now , listen , this part 's important . i want you to program one special command into all these systems . tell them these orders are irreversible , so it 'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back . can you do that , pal ?
pumps stop pumping oil . pipe lines stop pipin ' oil . tankers stop deliverin ' oil . man , this is high stakes .
and then shut down the pipe lines .
you catch on fast , old buddy . tell him about the pumps . i know how you love the part about the pumps .
then how 's all the people gon na get their oil ?
and do nothing . just sit there .
yes , but they do n't really need them . it 's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney .
they ai n't got captains ?
every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled . totally , by computers . computers to tell them where to go , how much oil to take on , where to deliver it .
huh ?
kryptonite !
he sure was n't actin ' bad and nasty that day in smallville . man , he was so full of niceness i was startin ' to feel funny about layin ' that chunk of ...
greed ! let me tell you something -- -
gus , if there 's anything i hate , it 's greed .
that 's what i been thinkin ' about . how you been keepin ' me . i ai n't getting ' nothing outta this gig .
god , that 's what i keep you for .
just hold on a minute . i have been doin ' some thinkin '
wait a second . astronomers know where the planet used to be , right ? and you know what happens when a planet explodes ? debris . pieces floating in space .
it ai n't . it 's nowhere . it blew up . that 's how come they shipped the dude to earth when he was a baby . well . i know some stuff too , y'all .
what are you talking about , fella ?
uh ... what channel were you watching ?
i did . is n't it neat-o ?
turn on the t.v .
just the man i wanted to see !
hey , boss .
not `` what . '' do n't need a genius to figure out `` what . '' need a genius to figure out `` where . '' he says i 'm a genius , your don -- brother ! bubba ! your bubba ! see , if y'all do n't want them to trace it back , you got to punch this in from someplace nobody 'd ever think off . some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer . ross it 's got to be someplace you can sneak into .
what ?
first question got to be `` where . ''
when ?
yeah , yeah , i can do it .
always making yourself beautiful for me , are n't you ? so , gus , can you make vulcan do what i want it to ? you did n't answer me , pal . did you hear about that prison riot last week ? it seems they were complaining about rats in the cells ...
like everything else in the 20th century , gus . you push buttons .
how do you do that ?
that what they call you ?
gus , tell me , have you ever heard of vulcan ?
me ? how ?
a very wise man once said ... i think it was attila the hun ... `` it 's not enough that i succeed . everyone else must fail . '' and you are going to do it for me .
but mr. webster ... you 're doin ' okay with brazil and them other places . what 's wrong with just one little old country doin ' their own thing ?
destroy the entire colombian coffee crop down to the last bean .
wipe 'em out ?
columbia 's got two major exports and one of them 's coffee .
columbia .
columbia .
which country ?
but y'see , chum , the problem i got is that one country just wo n't play ball with me . you know how that can just bug a guy , do n't you ?
decaffeinated too ?
under different company names . i control the price of coffee beans in brazil . the price in venezuela . java , south korea , north korea , the aleutian islands , guam , bolivia , and the republic of gabon !
plants . plants always make an office cozier .
man , what is this ?
i do n't think you understand .
black or regular ?
gus , do you know what i want now ? i want coffee !
i 'm tryin ' to .
gus , webco , the webster industrial complex , is a family-owned cartel . a little magnesium here , a little zinc there . some railroads here , some farm machinery there . you follow ?
'cause i know about getting ' them half-centses ?
yes ! that never occurred to me . her ya go , buddy , single-malt . gus , my friend , you 're a genius . okay , a naughty genius , but hell , nobody 's perfect .
or socks .
i believe they 're laundered and sent to some charitable institution . i do n't know what the heck they do with 'em . maybe they use them for dust rags , or pen wipers ...
yeah ? what do you do with 'em ?
now me , i was born rich . i 've never worn the same pair of socks twice .
uh ...
say , fella , i understand . i can -- what do the kids say these days -- `` dig where you 're comin ' from . '' you want to be rich , right ?
uh ... yeah . i did n't think of it that way exactly , but ...
you 've been a naughty boy have n't you ? c'mon now , admit it , you were kinda naughty .
mr. gorman , just answer me one question ...
please , mr. webster , you 're a great humanitarian . ai n't you heard what it 's like in them jails ? you send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and ...
suit yourself , gus . say , does your boss use a computer in this operation ?
i was afraid you 'd say that . hey , is there a bus station around here ?
thanks . let 's go
just a second .
whatcha wan na stop here for ? not that i ai n't glad to be on the ground , y'understand .
no ... i just have a little stop to make .
we back in metropolis ?
i never crash , gus . that 'd be embarrassing .
we gon na crash ?
no , we 're just going down .
watch out for them air pockets !
that 's up to the judge , gus . it 's not your problem anymore .
i ai n't about to argue with you . what 's gon na happen to them three ? ross the boss and those ladies ?
hey , you 're perfectly safe .
do n't make me talk , please . i got enough problems just hangin ' on .
how you doing down there ?
will you stop interrupting ? ! you will command the pumps to stop pumping .
i know , by computers .
and do what ?
you will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the atlantic ocean .
what she call you ?
oh bubba , think of the possibilities .
through the telephone line terminal , that ai n't nothin ' .
sister ! i 'm his sister !
hey listen , i did n't know your mama was comin ' by ...
it was hot !
you ! you 're lucky i did n't fire you . i get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with ? ? ? a broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film .
why do i have to do this ?
a story like this cries out for great human interest pictures . the big dance ! the homecoming game ! mr. kent posing next to his old locker !
what about you ?
what about me ?
all right , kent . i just hope you know what you 're doing . if you really think smallville is your big chance , go for it .
a photographer eats with his camera , a photographer sleeps with his camera --
i did n't have my camera with me .
you 're amazing , olsen . a boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures . then superman puts out a fire on third avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you do n't take one picture ! !
that 's his sister . vera webster .
who 's the other woman ?
her name 's lorelei ambrosia . she 's webster 's girl friday .
who is she ?
the bridge ... ? i 'd better get going !
listen , are you sure you should n't do something about the bridge ?
it 's hard to believe ... a great looking girl like you all alone like this . as she glances up at him , she is first flustered , then flattered , then ... finally ... just realistic :
hey , do n't i always get there in time ? come on , relax .
but the bridge ...
there 's no rush .
you just did , with that great dinner .
he was asleep before his head hit the pillow . well , this was only the biggest day of his life . i really do n't know how to thank you .
well ... i guess they did get a little carried away .
you know , i really was n't expecting all this .
i 'm sorry , i 'm in a real hurry . see you around , pal .
and this is ... ... clark . my friend is around here somewhere , i 'll just look for ...
we 've already met .
oh . i 'm lana lang . this is ricky .
anytime .
thank ... you .
i 'd wash that out with some iodine ... okay , mercurochrome .
ricky ? where ... what ...
i just knew i was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me .
lois , i 've got to hand it to you . you 're amazing . who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that 's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the caribbean ?
okay , kent , call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home . favoring clark -- happy now , he turns to leave the office . shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice , o.s .
hey , i 'd definitely shoot color on that one , jimmy . it 'd be a crime to just use black and white .
whoopee .
kent 's been invited to his high-school class reunion .
what terrific story ?
the picture 's fine . that 's the way she looks in real life .
the picture looks blurry .
that was n't me . that guy 's gone . and you 're next webster .
but the other night ...
i do n't know you , lady .
it is n't much , really , you see , there 's this little boat . well , not so little , really . and it 's not going where it 's supposed to go and ...
no , i do n't think i would . so ... then what can i do for you ?
never . i get air-sick . you would n't like that .
okay , what is it ? you want a ride ?
i 'll do more than tell you . i 'll show you , back at my place . if you 'll just do me one little favor first .
tell me .
lots of things ...
i 'm in no rush . so what do you have in mind ?
well , do n't let me keep you from anything .
do n't worry . i 'm long past saving .
hey , do n't expect me to save you . because i do n't do that anymore .
i thought you 'd never get here .
but how ? where 's it getting the power from ? ? ? !
i ca n't ! it 's out of control !
he can have mine . anytime .
cut the mush , lorelei . he 's after our skin !
oh , superman !
in other words , push this red button .
you ! activate circuits 29 through w7 and start full power coordinates on exterior defensive systems :
superman . the boy you left behind .
gus ?
come on , will you ? we 've got to get ready before he gets here .
where do you usually find a light switch ?
where 's the light switch ?
turn on the light .
i ca n't see anything .
and he use to be such a sweetie pie ! what 's wrong with him the last two weeks ?
`` at a special session of the general assembly , 178 countries voted to censure superman . with only columbia abstaining . '' ross that fella 's becoming a public menace .
so i understand from the graffiti i 've seen .
hey , i know a lot of things !
how would you know ?
energy ! and when they say `` energy '' what do they mean ? nuclear ? too dangerous . solar ? ? too underdeveloped .
diet soda ?
why stop at coffee ! a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning , but what keeps the world working ?
why do n't you hold your breath , instead ? maybe you 'll turn blue . on you that 'd be an improvement .
if you do n't mind , we are trying to hold a meeting here !
bubba , does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking ... !
ross , honey , it 's time for your massage ...
there is no handle ! you just push a button .
where 's the handle ?
it 's modern . it 's up-to-date . it 's state-of-the art . people , i am in love with this machine . go ahead , mr. white .
why do i have to do this ?
mr. white , you be in this shot , handing them their plane tickets .
could n't we just get a computer to do this ?
by hand . like the pioneers did .
how 'm i supposed to turn this thing ?
mr. white , the next number , please ?
you 've got to pick three more numbers .
okay ? goodbye .
53 !
53 .
because you 're the editor-in-chief . your integrity is unquestioned . lois i have a question .
why ca n't the idiot in circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place -- -
mr. white , please , it 's time for you to draw this month 's winning jingo number . the prize is an all-expenses trip to south america .
he 's bound to slip up sooner or later .
well , chum ? what now ? kiss the 85 thou goodbye ? pay some thief 's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree ?
hello .
now , vera ... uh , simpson , you know my staff dietician ?
my friend , you are yesterday . whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow .
i do n't know who . whom . i ca n't trace it . in the old days it was simple . we kept books , we had ledgers , we could see what was going in and what was paid out . if somebody wanted to rob you , he 'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up . '' now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work !
embezzled , mr. webster . stolen from the firm .
missing ? ? ? ?
85,000 dollars .
it 's your genius , pal ! you built a machine that can find anybody 's weak spot , just like you said .
yes ! this time we got it right !
do n't bet on it !
he 's coming ! he 's going to hurt me !
like fish he is . i know enough about computers to put a phd to shame . come now , brother dear , you did n't think i was going to let that little man run the show , did you ? gus gorman telling us what to do -- i 'd sooner kiss a pig !
he 's the only one who can operate this --
who needs gus ?
wait for gus to get here , sis .
come on , let 's give it a dry run .
not quite . what is that in the lower right hand corner ?
that 's it ! the last tanker ! they 're all mine now ! all ...
we can get to work on that oil !
and now that superman 's out of the nice guy business ...
a normal person .
do n't you see ? okay , so you did n't kill him . nobody 's perfect . but that stuff we ran up in the lab was n't a complete failure after all . right after gus gave it to him , superman started to turn into a selfish , ornery , malicious , conniving ...
so all we 've got to do is pick up the garbage . we just have to find our where in heaven krypton used to be . then good old gus here contacts the vulcan satellite --
so ?
the planet superman came from . krypton .
where did it come from ?
i just remembered the rest . there is n't any more . the only chunk that ever landed on earth disappeared a couple of years ago . it was in this story in the daily planet .
what 's wrong ?
wait a minute ! she 's right ! kryptonite . i remember reading about it in an interview with him . nuts ...
how ? shoot him ? you know about him and bullets . not to mention knives , tanks , bombs ...
nice try , butch , but it would n't be effective against superman . you 'll see ! now that he 's pulled this stunt , he 'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one , too ! i 've got to get rid of him ! i 've got to !
do n't cry , bubba .
he ruined it ! that lousy do-gooder , he ruined it .
i could have it all ! holy cats ! all the oil ! all the tankers ! all the pumps ! the gosh-darn world will be out to lunch ! no heat , no gas -- sis , this is some nifty idea !
chicken feed . if gus gorman can push the right buttons -- -
we already have a super-tanker .
small potatoes .
tomorrow the oil !
today coffee -- --
you mean ... you mean ... vera ! vera ! the magnitude of this ! ! !
well , webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system . how about ... hmmmm , someplace small ...
someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us .
gus gorman , this is my psychic nutritionist .
she 's not his mama either .
somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan .
computers talk to other computers , right ?
blizzards ! heat waves !
storms ! floods !
it could make weather !
but if somebody re-programmed it , it could do much more .
vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather .
oh , right . well then , just shake hands .
i do n't kiss .
get a hold of yourself , vera . nobody else ever will .
that 's what i want to know ! by whom ? whom ? ? ? ?
she 'll be fine .
are you okay ?
tourists , about twenty of 'em .
hostages ?
so far the hostages are unharmed .
anybody been hurt ?
yeah . i 'll check .
jimmy , how 's the -
everything on it .
everything on it ?
sure . especially if you 'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
you do ?
well , you should . because i appreciate you , too , you know .
i 'll try to remember that . . .
clark , stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name . nobody expects you to be what you 're not .
lois , i really do n't see why --
. . . superman ? . . . . .
i 'm fine . . . . . . what was i talking about ? before ?
take it easy . take a deep breath .
see what happens when i do n't have my orange juice ? the human body is only a workable , fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you 'd show to -- -- . . . gee . . .
i like worrying about you .
please do n't tell me `` you 'll find somebody else someday . '' cause . . . . . . well , you are a pretty hard act to follow , you 'll have to admit that . oh , i 'll get by , do n't worry about me .
lois , someday --
oh , i 'm not blaming you . i just know me . i 'd be jealous . jealous of . . . of all humanity . some rival , huh ?
what else could i do ?
everybody . everybody else . i 'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense . all the ones who say `` help . come quick . now '' i know who you 'd have to pick .
`` they ? ''
oh , when it comes to you i am . not that i do n't understand why they all need you . but they ca n't need you more than i do .
you 're not selfish at all .
me too , oh , i tried to convince myself , believe me , `` it 's like being married to a doctor , '' i said . doctors are practically never at home . the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it . then a voice said , `` could you be a doctor 's wife ? or are you too selfish . . . ``
i 'm sorry .
i know , i know all the arguments , you do n't have to tell me . that 's what i did all night -- i `` listened to the voices of reason '' till the dawn came up . do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you 've been up night crying ?
never closed my eyes .
sleep well ?
oh , hi .
hi .
he knew . i heard him . i just did n't listen .
do n't . . . it 's not your fault . . . you did n't know . . .
i have to try , dammit ! something , anything . . .
but what can you do ? there 's no way now . . .
i have to go back . . .to the fortress . . .
i know that , lois . and i wish he were here . . .
i do n't want a bodyguard . i want the man i fell in love with .
maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on .
let 's get you inside . . . .
blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside ?
clark . . . it does n't matter . . . we can move . . .
say you love me .
you did it . you gave it all up for me . i . . . i do n't know what to say .
your place ? maybe i should change , maybe you should , too .
let 's go to my place .
let 's go to my place .
i want to .
i guess it would be all right if - lois , now that you know me , i think you ought to know it all .
`` what 's happening . '' oh , is that the understatement of the year . well , so . . . where do you want to . . . talk ?
not here , perry 'll be calling at six to find out what 's happening .
i 'm listening .
we 'd better talk .
i 'm in love with you . how do you feel ?
well , not in your mind , but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
i did n't think i wanted to .
maybe you wanted to .
you do n't have anything to be sorry about . how could i . . .
oh come on , that 's ridic -
i was right . you are superman .
lois , i . . .
it 's true . it 's true .
lois , help ! i ca n't -- i ca n't swim -- !
oh clark , no !
what ? ?
because of what i 'm betting . my life .
how could you win a crazy bet like --
uh-uh . listen , i 'll tell you what . you say i 'm wrong . and i say i 'm right . so why do n't we make a little bet on it ?
you 've been under a lot of pressure lately -
no , of course not , lois . you just get carried away sometimes . believe me , i understand --
listen , i 've got to give you credit . your disguise is nearly perfect . i mean , if you fooled me , and i am nobody 's fool --
who ? ? ? ?
whoever , i look , maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head . i'ii meet you back at the motel .
do n't fake me out , clark . or whoever you are .
lois , i do n't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you 're --
and you were n't . as usual . what do you say to that ?
superman ? oh , was he here ?
i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around , you disappear .
i was getting hot dogs . what do you mean ?
where were you ?
frankly , once you 've seen superman in action , niagara falls tends to leave you cold .
no . i mean here you stand with one of nature 's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you 've had your back to it . are n't you impressed ?
aw , c'mon -- anybody can get hungry .
lois , you 're amazing .
hey , are you hungry ? i 'm hungry .
that 's because you can hardly see through those things .
i do n't know , they look pretty happy to me ...
mr. smith - -- the `` complimentary couch . ''
i was . . . uh . . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh , arrangements . sleeping arrangements .
oh sure , everything is complimentary . until you get the bill .
a `` complimentary corsage . ''
but this should be exposed . they get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get . that 's what perry says .
yeah , thanks . . . . i mean , really ! posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls . i mean , . imagine wasting a great reporter - -- uh , reporters -- on this . perry white and his sunday magazine exposes .
oh , you 're a great writer , lois , nobody doubts that .
hah , some guys say i have magic fingers .
'magic fingers . ' fifty cents .
in july ? ? ?
it is kinda romantic .
of course , that 's what friends are for .
really ?
clark , everything i was saying -- ca n't you see i only say it because i really care ?
be my guest .
maybe i could try --
have n't you heard ? there 's an energy crisis . no , this was good enough for my mother --
lois , why do n't you at least get one of those automatic ones ?
well , you should n't be more aggressive , clark ! trust your instinct ! when you see your opportunity , grab it ! i do .
actually , yes .
sure ! but nobody knows it . least of all you . look , would you mind if i gave you some constructive criticism ?
i do ?
of course not . not when you 've got so much going for you .
i do n't ?
oh sure . the american answer to everything . pills . no , this is -- -- natural .
one thousand ? ? that 's an awful lot of oranges . you know there are pill , lois . i 've seen them .
well , you never will again ! thanks to vitamin c ! i 'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of vitamin c every day .
uh . . .
when was the last time you heard me sneeze ?
lois , what are you doing ?
do i detect a note of jealousy ?
not everyone can have x-ray vision , you know .
then maybe you should get your glasses checked .
lois , i usually do .
no , i meant , it 's awfully dangerous .
no offense , kent . you 're good , but lois is the best we 've got .
gee . but --
the minute the story broke i bundled her on the first concord out of here . if paris goes kablooey i want the best reporter i 've got right there in the middle of it .
what ? ?
does she know about it ? she 's in it !
does lois know about this yet ?
that 's why they call 'em terrorists . go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
but . . ..that 's terrible !
dickens ! the whole world 's about to blow up and you 're reading dickens ? !
actually i was trying to catch up on my reading . there 's a lot of dickens i never got around to --
do n't you watch television ? do n't you listen to the radio ?
uh ... home ...
get your head out of the clouds , kent . where you been the last twelve hours ?
your heart , miss teschmacher ? i never knew you had one .
good . my heart ca n't take it .
you 'll miss the battle of the century !
so does your average cocker spaniel . give me another one . under . . . the big one there .
i like trees .
i would n't know . i 've never had one .
a good time ! is that all you care about ? !
look at this ! snow . ice . your idea of a good time .
mush ! mush !
north !
you thought about me in a parka . that 's sick , lex . really .
a parka .
a bikini ! i 'll need to buy a new bikini , lex . c'mon . after being cooped up in that prison , have n't you thought about me in a bikini . . ... once maybe ?
you 'll have to pack quickly .
there is some good in you , lex , after all .
how would you like to take a little vacation ? i mean you 've earned it , you know ? you deserve it .
what else is ballast for ?
lex ... lex , how could you do that to otis ?
it 's beautiful .
that was two days ago . frankly , i think this place is a bit boring . it 's all white . why does n't the guy put up some posters ? maybe some bullfight things . . .
why did n't you go before we left ?
wrong .
it has everything .
it 's beautiful .
it 's beautiful .
no , me , me , me . thank you .
i 'll be alright .
genius ! -- lex .
it ' s fantastic ! -- -- - this place is genius .
this way lex .
is this a philosophy seminar ? no . this is getaway .
why am i doing this ? why am i here ?
well done , miss teschmacher .
how the hell would i know ? i was in high school back in those days .
is n't that what the old canaveral guys used to call a comet on an east-west trajectory ?
what 's a curl ?
i think he said a `` curl . ''
what 'd he say before ? he saw a girl ?
artemis ? do you read me ?
superman 's got something up his sleeve , that 's for sure . we just have n't figured it out . is n't that right , miss lane ?
game plan ! it 's fourth down and long yardage , the two-minute warning sounded and the ball 's deep in our territory ! how brilliant do you have to be ? !
maybe we just don ' t know his game plan .
i ca n't understand it ! where is he ? i mean , he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree , and now he decides to pull a disappearing act ?
he knows where the eiffel tower is , olsen . you do , do n't you , kent ?
a gang of terrorists seized the eiffel tower in paris
give it another ten minutes . if we do n't -- hell , i 'll tell him . pete ? if we have n't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt . banner and run the picture for three columns . kent , i need a background story for the page 3 sidebar . give me every thing you know about this terrorist group .
mr. white , the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page .
yes .
and she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you ?
but you had more than that , and i know it . you and my father -- you had each other . can i never have what you had ?
because that is your heritage . those are the values we lived by on krypton .
patience , kal-el . you begin to sound like an earthling . superman mother , you speak only of honor , of sacrifice , of responsibility --
yes , but it 's not all i feel .
you have been given a higher form of happiness . the happiness you feel by serving others , by inspiring them to --
selfish ! but they get a chance at happiness . ca n't i have that chance ?
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest . surely this is not how you repay their gratitude , kal-el . could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream .
i did n't ask her anything . . .
the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might - we can not predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space . i can not say i am glad you asked me that -
i asked the right question .
the elders have , of course , thought long and hard about that question .
no possibility for parole ?
and so our scientists constructed , from an irreversible mathematical equation , the phantom zone . in it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity .
sensible enough .
the three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation . now as you know , we had no death penalty -
my kind of people .
for many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony . then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on earth are classified as `` criminals . ''
now this i want to hear .
-- as the keeper of the archives of krypton , it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history .

ahhhhhh -- alpha waves .
that little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar , it tracks alpha waves .
that little black box , mr. luthor , i mean -- what 's it for ?
shhhhhhh !
oh ! that black box in our cell ?
otis , your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate . every man has a vulnerable point . some like you otis , have more that one . i did n't see superman 's in time . but now through patience , invention and skill , my black box is just about ready .
to ski ?
why ?
north .
where ?
i mean they ca n't even trace that guy on that radar they got , every time they try he just flies off .
delete in cutting
delete in cutting
i want my liberace record back tonight .
do n't feel bad , mr. luthor . it almost worked . i mean california almost threw up right in the ocean . millions of people almost killed . if it had n't been for that guy superman - that overgrown boyscout ...
australia .
what do you want ?
oh , general , the world is a big place . thank goodness , my needs are small ... as it turns out , i have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
we will bring him to his knees !
certainly . but - er . oh magnificent one , he 's just one , but you are three , or four even , if you count him twice .
he has powers as we do . . .
constantly .
he flies as well , then . . .
revenge ! we will kill the son of our jailer !
oh my fullness , as i explained to you before , i am about the best there is . second best there is .
the son of jor-el on this planet ?
no , jor-el , the baseball player that came from porto rico . yes jor-el your jailer .
oh magnificent one . what i am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son of jor-el .
we have all of this without you . you can not bargain with what you do n't have .
wait , wait , wait just a moment . wait till you 've got to know better will you please . wait , -- look , i can give you anything you want . i can give you the brass ring , the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim , cure , destroy , chew - plus lex luthor 's savvy . lex luthor 's career guidance ... lex luthor 's school of ...
but him is you . now i 'm confused .
oh no . i really like it sometimes . and if it were n't for him , i would n't have met you .
it must be tough , having to be clark kent .
hey , do n't worry . you 'll be fine , just . . . well , do n't rush it .
i never did this before . . . i have to tell you .
dinner . oh yes . i 'm sorry , i just never do much about that . but tonight -- i mean , anything you want , lois .
like it ? it 's magnificent ! not that it could n't use a woman 's touch . especially around dinner time .
so -- i hope you like it .
well . . . it 's been more like a fortress than a home . until now .
i must be . but i 'm not . your home . this is your home .
you must be freezing .
the bomb ! it 's in there ! any second now , its --
really lois , we 've got to stop meeting this --
superman ! the --
wait a minute , wait a minute , let 's talk a deal , superman . we can take a lunch on this --
which one would you like to join , luthor ? pick a hole .
listen . have i got a proposition for you , superman . i mean i owe you one , you know ? now do n't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
too late , luthor . too late . . .
are you kidding ? i knew it all the time . did you see how they fell into our trap ? beautiful . . .
i knew you 'd double-cross me , luthor . a lying weasel like you could n't resist the chance . . .
luthor , you poisonous snake . . .
wait ! do n't go in ! it 's a trap !
i 'll have to take the chance . try to get them all into that molecule chamber . it takes away their powers , reduces them to human beings . now if you could . . .
me ? i 'm loaded with good ! i mean i 've never even used it .
perhaps there is some good in you after all , lex luthor .
now i shall have the son of jor-el as my slave ! forever . if not , the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance . beginning with this one .
hey , let 's be fair . actually , there 've been two or three times --
put down lex luthor ?
put down lex luthor !
north . keep going north !
where is his home , lex luthor ? which way ?
no drinks . no movie . this is the last time i take a charter flight .
cuba .
what more ?
perhaps a small . . . incentive , your ultimate . a tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
there is something more you want . the greed is written on your face .
kill me ? lex luthor ? extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age ? eradicate the only man on earth . . .
why do you say this to me when you know i will kill you for it ?
he ran in fear from us . . .
you said it . three-to-one should get you both ears and the tail .
come to me , superman ! if you dare ! i defy you ! come ! come , and kneel before zod !
you 'll find out , general ! and when you do . . .
who is this . . . superman ?
zod . zod .
i wish i knew . -- oh , god .
who is this imbecile ? where is he ?
it will . starting with your own .
i 'm the man they 're protecting . i 'm the president . i 'll kneel before you if it will save lives .
we have not the choice to refuse , have we , if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have .
yes , but will you honor it ?
um . . . .we have made this guarantee .
there will be no attack ? no attempt to overpower the terrorists ?
in return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them .
and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages ?
`` super-sucker . `` for once , lex luthor was right .
did you really believe we would give up our advantage ?
we must combine our strength .
general -- - ?
do n't worry . i will draw his fire . with a few of my own .
he 's captured non !
sentimental idiot .
he ... cares . he actually cares about these . . . . . .these people . these earth people .
yes ?
this `` super '' man is nothing of the kind . i have discovered his weakness .
and so i was yesterday . and the day before .
you are master of all you survey .
brave young heroes . be nice to them , my dear . blow them a kiss .
look , they need a machine to fly .
stay . i will come to you .
what shall we do now ?
so this is the planet houston . . .
and i will lead .
delete in cutting
then we must go there too . to rule . finally - to rule ! and then you shall have what you want .
delete in cutting ) there . . . a place called . . . houston . . .
yes . to all of us . the closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers !
strange . i tore those metal fibers like paper . and what he did . . .. was amazing ! something is happening . . ..
free !
free !
lacy . . . i . . .
maybe if you 'd have met who i am now , instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago , it would have been different between us .
you 'll find a good man lacy . you deserve one .
you know : strong , gentle , tall men with bright blue eyes and square . men who like to dance slow , the old fashioned way , the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom .
like me ?
any more like you back home , clark ?
i 'm not so sure you do .
you do n't have to be polite , clark . i 've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me .
i 'm sorry to see you go .
daddy 's offered me jobs at some of his other companies . but , i 've been thinking maybe i 'll take some time off . i 'm going to find a place like smallville , in the country . maybe a farm . . . see what the slow lane is like .
no mind , it 's only antique irish linen .
gee , i 'm really sorry .
let 's sit down . they walk to the table . lois calls out to the balcony .
hi . is dinner ready ? i 'm famished .
clark . . . !
oh . . . my . . .
but they 're expecting us . it would n't be polite .
i missed you . it was n't any fun up there with just lois and superman . they 're so boring . let 's go do something wild !
oh . . . right . . . i 'll be back in a flash .
should n't you pay the cabbie ?
. . . let me get my purse .
hello , lacy . can anybody break a twenty ? the cabbie did n't have any change .
come early . the view is so romantic from my balcony .
gee , i do n't think . . .
i 'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we 'll have high tea . it 's very chic .
yes , i know . i 'm sure it will be a great story .
then prove it . lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission . . .
i 'm not avoiding you . i 've been very busy and . . . i like you . . . i really do .
he 's a jerk . i never noticed it before . seems like a lot of people i know are jerks . . . . . . maybe you think the same thing about me . that 's why you keep avoiding me .
if you say so . here goes .
now you try , clark . we 'll start you off with 60 pounds .
do n't give up . this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis . now let 's get those knees up !
maybe i should sit this one out .
do n't worry , i 've got you .
i feel kind of light-headed . . .
no , realistic . there 's no magic in the world . girls just do n't get swept off their feet anymore .
that sounds kind of pessimistic .
do n't tell me you 're waiting for lightning to strike . wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species .
well , my career takes up a lot of my time .
what about here ?
oh . . . no , there 's no one back home .
that 's not what we were taught . 'look out for number one ' -- that 's daddy 's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold .
no ... metropolis is a confusing place . back in smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple . people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand .
my prom was so boring . we all flew to paris the next day to recover . . . sometimes my whole life seems boring . i thing maybe i should just give everything away and go live among the poor people . then i remember how smashing i look in sable . . . oh , it 's all so confusing . you think i 'm silly , do n't you ?
actually , i had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom .
do n't tell me . you learned to dance at church socials .
this is metropolis after hours ! this is what you 'll be writing about . c'mon , let 's dance .
i 've never been in a place like this before .
oh , clark , you 're so delightfully primitive .
gosh , i 'm sorry , we better get in line .
you 're late . very late .
do n't worry . i wo n't make you do it alone . i know all the right places . i 'm a member at all the right clubs . . . we 'll start tonight at the grand opening of the metro club ! it 's a date !
they make my eyes itch .
that 's just it ! you do n't have to flaunt it . you 're no slave to fashion ... although ...
and i 'm usually in bed by ten-thirty .
but you 're perfect for it . you 're young , you 're single , you 're successful ...
i really do n't think . . .
it 's brilliant . daddy thinks so , too . you 'll write a new series -- 'metropolis after hours . '
well , i 'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because i had a visit from a very good nurse .
it must have been a super effort to get out of bed , clark .
you know him so well . but i 'm sure he 'll manage . . . wherever he is .
everyone 's saying he 's . . . dead . but i know that is n't true . i feel it in my heart . i think he just needs help .
superman ? has something happened to him ?
you have n't been at work . . . you did n't call the office . . . you did n't even call me . how could you not call back ?
it 's just a bad flu , really . how did you know . . .
clark , it 's lois . this is the fourth message . i 've left . . . where are you ?
. . . please leave your message at the beep .
politely ?
it 's her father 's grey matter that 's weakened if you ask me . how can i ask superman such a dumb question .
'are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense ? '
i do n't think 'fan mail ' fits this letter . read it , clark .
oh , probably just a picture request . i 'll take care of it if you want , lois .
you always overreact , clark . how terrible can it be ?
the president is about to speak . i do n't think it 's going to be good news .
clark . . . wait !
i do n't think we 're being treated fairly , lois . and i 'm going to tell miss warfield .
no paris ?
au contraire , mon ami ! he owns all those sleazy tabloids and the daily planet !
that tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids ?
regardez . voila monsieur david warfield .
gee guys , that 's swell of you . but . . . i 've got another idea .
lex , we all appreciate how you 've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we 've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent .
if my plan works , gentlemen , i 'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate . . . a number with a lot of zeros after it .
and what do we get out of it ?
do people die in italian operas ? gentlemen , if all goes to plan nuclear man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce superman 's skin . he 'll be mortal , he 'll get sick . . . and we 'll dance on his grave .
and this so-called . . . nuclear man . . . of yours can defeat superman ?
boys , old lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew . you help me place it on one of your missiles and i promise you . . . if superman throws it into the sun , he 'll get the biggest surprise of his life . i 'll be able to introduce superman to his first nightmare . . . a nuclear man !
and what am i ? a shriner ? no , if you 'll join forces with me , together we can make the world safe for war profits again .
but superman is n't an average man .
of course it is . do you know what the sun is ? why it 's just one huge nuclear bomb . a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that .
close the curtains . the sun is hurting my eyes .
good . if you can see it , and i can see it , maybe some day everyone will see it .
but you ca n't tell where one country begins and another ends . you ca n't see any borders . it 's just . . . one world .
go on . . .
well . . . i see the ocean currents . . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers . . . but . . .
i 'll try . . .
jeremy , i need you to tell the people of the world what you see .
awesome !
n-no ... i mean ... you bet .
would you mind waiting for me in the visitor 's gallery ?
absolutely !
would you mind taking a walk with me ?
i 'm sorry .
well , i do n't understand .
i 'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world . i promise you . for it is they , and not i , that represent the people of earth .
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away ? what good was my letter ?
because i made a vow . never to interfere in the destiny of your planet .
impossible ? why ?
do n't be over-dramatic , young lady . what kind of disaster could we help bring about ?
no , daddy . our business is journalism . we ca n't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we 'll just lead everyone into a disaster .
less sensational papers go broke . i thought i taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business .
i 'd just like to have a little less sensationalism .
tone down our headlines ? lacy , that 's all the common man reads !
stuff it .
yes , darling ?
daddy . . . ?
did n't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help ? now that you 're the publisher . . .
i know daddy . i 'm worried about him .
darling , it 's good riddance . let her go . and while you 're at it , fire that clark kent . he has n't been here in days . he has n't even called .
your grandfather had one iron rule that 's stood me well . never fraternize with the help . keep too your own station . am i clear ?
oh . . . no . . . i mean , we just went dancing . . . for a story . . .
clark kent ! you socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter !
who does clark kent think he is anyway ! he never even said good night !
mr. white , come with me i want to see
not so fast ! all trips are canceled . we pay for wire services . and what we do n't get from them , we 'll invent .
it always is with clark .
he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh , it 's a long story .
where 's clark ?
our other dinner guest .
what 's that ?
something . . . wonderful .
what 's he going to say ?
why , lois , i did n't know . . . who is he ?
but he 's never there .
right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
and your heart beats faster just thinking about him .
lois , have you ever fallen for a guy and he 's not like other guys . . . he 's different . it 's like you come from two different worlds .
that 's because there 's nothing to figure out . now will you please pay attention . i 'm not through insulting your father .
clark . he 's late again . i ca n't figure him out .
who ?
i know i 'm not exactly a girl scout but . . . maybe if i show him i 'm trying . . . he 'll like me .
daddy loves to whip up campaigns ! people eat it up . we 'll make this kid a celebrity . the whole world will be waiting for superman 's answer .
an angle ?
i think there 's an angle .
superman gets mail here ?
this letter was addressed to superman care of me .
. . . and very nave !
but all men like me , lois . i 'm very rich .
forget it , princess . clark is the world 's oldest boy scout trustworthy , loyal , obedient , helpful ... and i do n't remember the rest , but he 's them too . and i promise , he 's not interested in anyone like you .
i think he 's kind of cute .
one hundred percent . and i like him that way .
is he for real ?
lucky i brought my drums .
never . but we have to hide out for a while . lay low . say . . . a couple of years . by then i 'll have a new plan .
you think he 'll find us .
if you need us we 'll , be five hundred feet underground waiting for the nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring .
ready , uncle lex ?
do n't worry honey , i 'm sure he 'll make a swell husband .
i think he has his own plan , uncle lex .
this was n't in the plan .
we 'll all fry .
my nephew , leonard . he worships me . let 's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who 's about to finish last .
boy , are you gon na get it .
what ?
of course ! that 's his one vulnerability . the one way he can be stopped .
good . let 's hope he stays that way .
he 's . . . cold . . .
hmm . . . nuclear levitation . now that 's a trick that could come in handy .
did n't you see it ? he lifted me up and crashed me down .
what was that about ?
you 're just an experiment , freako !
hey ! just remember i made you .
he 's . . . beautiful . perfect .
hey ! he looks . . . normal .
there !
you 're spookin ' me out , uncle lex .
not how i might have put it , but , correct . the remains i sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory . he 'll remember everything that he experienced . not to worry . he 'll find his way back to me . did you hear that ?
the one superman wrecked up ?
oh leonard . . . when i sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
hey , uncle lex , how 's the nuclear guy goin ' to find his way here ?
get the box , nephew .
gee , uncle lex , i was just getting to the good part .
i must have miscalculated . how . . .
superman broke your monster , uncle lex .
let 's try to keep your i.q . a family secret , leonard . before we launch him against superman , we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction . kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala . and once he proves himself , then . . .
gee , uncle lex , i do n't think this guy 's much of a dancer .
he has all of superman 's powers . if i 've planned it right . . .
whoa . . .
quiet ! you 'll make him self-conscious .
he missed the door , uncle lex .
that hair contains a sample of superman 's genetic material . the building blocks of his body . with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes , i will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me !
but why the hair ?
. . . i look at you , lenny , and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate .
a toupee that flies ?
do you realize what i can create with a single strand of superman 's hair !
lenny , , you pathetic product of the public school system . your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman !
are we going to skip the country , uncle lex ?
i am master now .
stop ! i command you . . . you mutant !
destiny .
me ? now ? with superman dead and you on my team ? it 's like i 'm the coach and you 're the best power forward ever . what could i have to fear ?
what do you fear ?
nice bit . you 're good . with my brain and your , well , frankly , brawn , the possibilities are staggering . i could be . . . emperor , king ! did you see how scared those guys were ?
first , i have fun .
nifty , huh ? goodnight sweet prince , parting is . . . inevitable now , destroy superman .
wait ! not yet ! back !
destroy superman !
i made you , and i can destroy you .
i am an experiment ? i am freako ?
you are . . . nothing . i am father now .
what ? a genius ? . . . an inspiration ?
you are . . .
i had n't counted on this but . . . . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat . i am a ...
for dignity . my reputation is at stake . just put it on .
what i need this for ?
no . . . it 's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil .
but . . . but is n't the world about to be osterized ?
high school physics , luthor . while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun , it must have been his source of energy .
but . . . how could you beat him ?
right , good . tell you what , we 'll wait right here . till you get back .
i 'll deal with you later .
still having delusions , lex luthor ?
superman . . . but you 're ... dead !
a mind is a terrible thing to waste , lex luthor . and you 've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity . i 'm taking you in .
nobody wants war . i 'd just like to keep the threat alive .
you 'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains .
precisely . and then it came to me . my greatest ever plan . i made a deal with some minor league bad boys . arms dealers , renegades generals , you know the type . with you gone , we 'll make a fortune rearming the world .
which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun .
i 'll ignore that . . . so , i created a monster who did n't work nearly as well as i might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy , more power .
i 'm not going anywhere .
no , no , listen . i escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of superman .
your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state , luthor .
you 've broken all the laws of man , luthor . and now you 've broken the laws of nature ! . . . i assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles i hurled into the sun !
look closely at his cell structure . see anything familiar ?
why ? because i want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block .
it 's common knowledge you hate children and animals . why are you back in metropolis ?
know something ? you 're a workaholic . a good guy 24 hours a day . stop and smell the roses sometime . take up a hobby . get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy . . .
if you have any social skills , you 've learned them from a rattlesnake . just what are you up to ?
silly me . how do i ever think i can fool the super guy . you 're right , no bomb . i just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call . i confess . . . i tricked you . hey , you look great !
luthor , i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you 'd be far away from here by now .
guess who ? it 's your old friend , lex .
not you . you . tell me again .
me ?
got it ? otis ?
yes , mr. luthor . the xk101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected . it also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it . it just goes around it or over it . the xk101 never quits ! it will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target !
one of them should 've been you .
yes , so , well , werner would 've gotten to that too but -- -- but the xk101 flies only eight feet above the ground ... well below the radar limit ! so what ? we could have done that soon . we had ways to make people ta -- ways to avoid the radar . and this xk101 -- they think it 's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos ' underground . hah ! we kept many things underground .
-- thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of --
albert !
it 's very simple , otis . very simple , the xk101 rocket . it 's nothing , forty years ago we in the fatherland were working on this . five more years , we would 've had it . but then -- -- that silly war ... why , my cousin werner had already --
and stop interrupting . his is the big scene . your finest hour ! you rose to the challenge , baby ! and you lost . that 's the best part !
but mr. luthor , sir , i already --
we 're running out of smoke .
ah ! the guest of honor at last ! and about time , too !
otherwise , you 're a mongoloid idiot . it 's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion , and --
thank you .
you 're a great architect , albert .
he 's thirty-five years old .
that the planet blew up on may 23 , 1937. that the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach earth . ergo ?
shut up , apple-polisher .
nobody else .
ahhhh , my favorite part of the day . who else could have thought of this aquarium ?
wonderful . otis will go above and steal some big macs .
there 's some slice american cheese ... and ... a half a bottle of club soda , i think .
i take the man out of argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know ? and what does he think about ? bunkers . still living in the past , when i am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world !
bunkers !
you 'll be designing monuments soon , albert ! hotels ! palaces !
stop saying you know when i say 'y'know . ' i know you know . yes , i know you 're here , otis . what do you want , a brass band ?
i know , but --
it 's for that piece she 's doing on women and competition . she 's off to the women 's western golf classic .
what 's she doing in california ?
she 's in california . that 's wild enough , i guess .
lois is n't here ?
you and lois , you get all the action . there she is , out in the wild west and everything .
it was hot , yes .
a hot story , huh ?
i 've been on the job .
you 'd better get a new alarm clock . the chief has been hollering for you .
i will .
keep warm now .
north . it 's north
do you know where you 're headed ?
i know son , i know ...
mother ...
he 's a good man , ben is . your father always said so .
i talked to ben hubbard this morning . he 'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares .
i know .
mom ...
anyway , we kent 's do n't like showoffs , ai n't that so ? a body 's got to be humble even if he knows that he 's better'n his neighbors .
do n't worry , mom . i know .
i know you 're a good boy , clark . no mother could ask for better . it 's just that ...
no , mom . you know i would n't break my promise .
clark ... son ... that ... thing you did with the sheriff today ... those ... stunts ... you do n't do those things at school , do you ?
yes , but i 'm the only one who knows him . i -- i really like the guy . and he likes me . i think . i mean , i could talk to him , you know ? and he could talk to me . anytime ...
you 're not the only one .
oh , what a chance ! if i could just -- get to him .
no thanks .
it is n't that i still do n't like you , clark . it 's just that ... well , once you 've had something like that happen to you , it kind of changes a girl . i 'm going to make some coffee . you want some ?
super ... man . hmmm ...
they will once i hang it on him in tomorrow 's edition .
is that what they 're calling him ?
superman . pretty good name for him , is n't it ?
what 'd you call him ?
of this ... superman .
jealous ? of what ?
you 're just jealous .
i do n't know , lois , but i do know a fraud when i hear one . this thing goes against all natural laws .
why would he do that ? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip .
look , there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce .
he grabbed me ! he held me ! he set me down gently ! how could that be done with mirrors ?
mirrors , then . it 's done with mirrors .
there were n't any wires . i looked .
it was done with wires . they must have rigged him like they do with peter pan .
clark kent , if you had only seen it the way i did , you -
oh sure . a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it was n't a trick .
it was n't a trick !
you were probably so scared you did n't look to see what the trick was .
i 'm telling you , i was there .
come again ?
not unless you can fly .
can i take you to the airport ?
lois , you should see what the inside of your lungs look like .
there 's no real proof that tobacco --
no . i 'm just thinking that you smoke too much , if you do n't mind my saying so .
for what ? oh , i 've see the way the other half lives . my sister , for instance . it looks terrific , but is that what i really want ? three kids , two cats , and fifteen needlepoint pillows ? i 'd go bananas after one week . hell , i need this crazy existence of mine . like i need the plague , right ? that 's what your thinking .
do n't you ever give up ?
it 's not what you think . darn it . i 'm going out on a story . the secretary of defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid 's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he 'd rather duck .
oh .
thanks , clark , but i 'm booked for the night .
oh , not really . i guess i 'll just watch a little tv and -- -- unless ... would you be interested in dinner ?
big night coming up ?
huh ?
what now , my love ?
i just took a shot at it .
you described the exact contents of my purse .
know what ?
supposing that man had hurt you ? is it worth risking your life over ten dollars , two credit cards , and a lipstick ? i mean , it 's not as if --
you 're great with the advice , clark . maybe you 'd better take over the lovelorn column .
it is n't worth getting a heart attack over , lois .
oh , for god 's sake !
he may have a gun !
stop him , clark !
what the -- !
hey !
not in metropolis it is n't . this is the home of the sneak attack , the stab in the back , the --
unbelievable .
see ? did n't i tell you this was a tough town ?
'swell . ' when was the last time i heard anybody say - where are you from , anyway ?
but otherwise it 's swell .
some people are n't the athletic type .
i think i lost a week 's salary at the dart board .
well , how are you enjoying your first day on the job ?
not really , no .
are there any more at home like you ?
not really , no .
not ... gray .
actually , she 's silver-haired .
i know . he sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother .
no .
your bookie ?
hey , you 're getting a better class of people in your office these days , boss .
i 'll bet you have some good ideas .
well !
i 'd like to .
okay . take me to your leader .
what can i tell you ? he 's my leader .
look , lady , you saved my life once . i owe you a favor . but i ca n't understand why you follow a man like that .
oh .
sure , and let the plane crash in the middle of the city .
could n't we forget the plane ? you could lift me in your big strong arms ?
i 'd better get you down .
the way you describe him does n't really do him justice .
the bald man ! the one who tried to kill me ?
he wants to see you . lex luthor .
besides that .
screaming
what are you doing here ?
help ! i mean -- i ca n't stop saying it . silly , is n't it - there 's nothing to worry about . help ! see .
you ! the girl from the volcano ! kryptonite ...
you too . i just ... i ca n't get it on for good guys . y'know ?
listen ... thank you .
of course i can . i love you .
you ca n't do this to me !
what other one ?
i mean the other one !
i 'm wearing it .
good . fine . now where 's my parachute ?
miss teschmacher , superman is a fairly bright individual . my understanding of the way he works is that he wo n't be fooled by a simple trick .
where 's mine ? ! where 's my parachute ?
lex is going bye-bye .
danger ? ? somebody ? ? ? lex -- where are you going ?
he always shows up when somebody 's in danger .
what if he does n't show up ? what if he 's taking a nap ?
you got wax in your ears ?
tea ?
nothing , nothing . i just want to invite him to tea .
what are you going to do to him ?
not exactly . but it 's his kind of neighborhood .
oh . why ? does he live up here ?
i did n't bring any --
your volcano chum ? your junior life-saving buddy ? let 's get high .
this all has something to do with superman , does n't it ?
yours not to reason why , miss teschmacher . relax ! enjoy it ! just look at that smog !
i do n't understand .
baby -- i 'm going to take you higher .
a night on the town instead of under it ?
she knows . clever , very clever . and unappreciated . but i 'm going to take you away from all this .
i know ...
you 've been under such a strain . and i 've ... i 've -- -- neglected you . mea culpa ! y'know .
i knew you 'd hit me .
hit you ? a clever girl like you ? 'he turned slowly , slowly in the lava ... ' was how you described it . now that 's clever . i have to hand it to you .
you 're not going to hit me ?
something you can feed the pets , perhaps ? let 's have it .
there was a recipe on the back --
no news is not good news . y'know
you have two minutes and thirty- two seconds .
you ? ! how about me ?
do n't let me down .
nothing .
but if i put my leg out like claudette clobert in --
they stop for nothing .
ready .
ready ?
is that an innuendo , miss teschmacher ? because if it is , you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle .
you ever try to run in high heels ? you probably did .
weak sister . i still ca n't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out . y'know ?
i do n't like to talk about it , lex .
about vesuvius . about superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano . ahh , the look on his face when he saw that kryptonite . when will i see another , y'know ? y'know ?
the least we can do is leave him another door jam .
what do you suggest , my dear ?
we just take it ?
the door jam , miss teschmacher . this ethiopian shmendrick here , in his simple , unconscious way , needed something to wedge the door open , the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet . so he grabs something from the table ...
you 're not going to tell us why you 're happy , are you ?
la de da da ...
you 're happy , are n't you ?
i will as soon as i get the sand out of my nose .
breathe that air , miss teschmacher .
no , you 're going to get kissed ,
i know i 'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this , but so what ?
tune me in , lady . an explosion such as the one superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the krypton rock .
i do n't mean to denigrate your misspent youth , lex , but what does that rock have to do with --
ahh . 'national geographic . '' in my day , this made 'playboy '' look like mother goose .
bingo !
meteorites !
deductive reasoning , my friends ! that 's the name of the game . what does it say here ?
mr. romance ...
stay and listen ! besides , it 's twelve in the afternoon . this is no time to go to bed .
i 'm going to bed .
see ? i see . it 's you who do n't see . does n't see . i can not believe it ! how you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this ! y'know ?
see ?
exactly , miss teschmacher .
i read the article .
some people can read 'war and peace ' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story . other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe . y'know .
krypton ? the place where superman comes from ?
krypton !
when it gets to seventy-five below , stabilize it .
fifty degrees below and still falling .
what 's the temperature now ?
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen. ,
damn ! this will get him .
i did n't say a word .
shut up .
you 're on .
bet he makes it .
tough guy , huh ?
nuts . he made it .
he 's from another world .
you think he 's for real ?
i needed this , y'know ? i really needed this . just when i 'm nearing the fruition of my project , big bird flies into town . go ahead ! kill me by inches ! put me on the agony rack !
first the pets , otis .
again ? ? ?
what about dinner ? i have to worry about the crime of the century , that 's all . y'know ? am i supposed to worry about what 's in the refrigerator , too ? what 's in it ?
speaking of feeding things , what about dinner ?
even that would be an improvement .
you 'll be seeing stars in a minute , miss teschmacher . y'know ?
streets , sunlight . when was the last time i saw sunlight .
criers and complainers ! that 's what i get ! moaners and groaners ! me , lex luthor , who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes . lex luthor , who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea , so to speak , hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above .
so i 've noticed .
compared to what came before ? a year of living in the sewers ? a part of that will always be with me .
this ? ?
i know that . bu tin this case he was right . arnold 'buster ' luthor , the most inept check forger of his time -- a pity he did n't live to see his son strike out for the big city . a pity he did n't live to see how , from humble beginnings , i created an empire .
your father was a sick weirdo .
my father always said to me , 'son , do n't invest your money in anything but land . land ! stocks rise and fall , banks fall , people are no damn good , but they 'll always need land and for that they 'll pay through the nose . 'remember that , ' my father said . 'land . ''
why does it all mean so much to you ? all the time , 'land , land , land . '
so it 's six hundred feet below park avenue , it 's still a park avenue address .
it is n't a park avenue address . really .
me and my real estate ? how many other girls , miss teschmacher , are lucky enough to have a park avenue address like this ?
you and your real estate .
neither my wife nor i will attempt to leave krypton .
will you abide by the council 's opinion ?
if you persist , you leave us no choice .
as an irredeemable criminal ? you compare me to them ?
and if i do n't obey ?
this discussion is terminated . the decision of the council is final . you will cease pursuing this matter . any attempt by you to continue , to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace , will be deemed an act of insurrection !
i have sworn to uphold the laws of krypton .
but so is vond-el
then -
you are one of krypton 's greatest scientists jor-el -
my friends , i am not a rash , impulsive person . i 'm not given to wild , unsupported statements . we must evacuate this planet immediately !
jor-el , be warned . this tone of yours approaches insolence .
but you ca n't ignore these facts ! it 's suicide ! worse than that , it 's genocide .
on the salary he pays me , i ca n't make my rent without it .
need i ask who 's favored to collect at the end of this week .
it 's because i 'm an intrepid girl reporter , jimmy . besides , the chief of detectives has the hots for me .
how come you get all the good stories , lois ?
gets you where you live , huh ?
boy !
'and the people on the street , the little man who runs the corner newsstand , the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare . '
two .
an ode to spring . are there one or two `` t 's '' in bloodletting ?
what 're you writing , lois ?
i bless the day you came to us , son . you know that . but some people would n't understand .
what your mother means , clark , is that she do n't want folks to think you 're special .
oh , dear . that is n't what i --
do n't brag now , jonathan .
got all a 's this year . teacher said he 's the best 5th grader in the -
we do n't want a child called 'junior , ' ai n't that so , clark ? why sure it is .
who ? clark ? i never cared two hoots for that fella . jonathan jr. that 's got a ring to it .
i was thinkin ' what to call him . i was thinkin ' i had an uncle who was a fine man , you recall him ? the church sexton
guess i 'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that ... that thing he was settin ' in . what do you make of that thing ? martha ? you listening ?
we 'll say he 's a child to my cousin in north dakota , and just now orphaned . poor thing .
folks 'll ask question .
all these years , happy as we 've been , how i prayed and prayed he 'd see fit to give us a child . and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot ... no one must ever know .
he sure as heck does that .
the good lord works in mysterious ways .
all of us .
well - got ta change that tire if were gon na get home .
do n't just stand there gapin ' jonathan . ca n't you see he 's cold ?
what 's your name , boy ?
it 's a ... baby .
then you have on of those 'feelings . ' it was called : 'love . '
i want to know what my child is going to face .
you 've been doing some research in the archives .
well , physiologically , he ... wo n't quite fit .
he will be odd , different .
yes , true . but on other worlds there would be other problems - heat , cold , no life , no life support systems ... no , lara , believe me ; earth is the least of evils . on earth , his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that ca n't be helped . but with his denser molecular structure , he will also be strong . he will be fast , he will be virtually invulnerable .
he 'll be weightless .
their atmosphere will sustain him . he will look like one of them .
a million years behind us . jor-el , he 's only a baby .
they are primitive , lara , but they are not animals .
but why earth , jor-el . they 're practically animals .
lara , please ...
-- as we will be .
it 's the only logical conclusion . if he remains here , he 'll be as dead as ...
and it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history . all you can do , kal-el , even now that you have ... found yourself ... is help them to evolve . set an example . show them they must strive towards the light . and ... remember us ...
there are none of them any good anyway .
or twenty-four as it is in earth time . furthermore , if you will reveal yourself , your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable : by hurting the people you care for . ah , this earth ... this world you live in , kal-el ... resist its temptations , its rewards , especially its political system .
twenty-four .
... .to feel yourself . very well . you are revealed to the world . but still you must keep your secret identity . first of all , you will need it as an escape valve . you can not be special twenty-eight hours a day -
how good it felt -
how good it felt !
no ! you could n't imagine -
my son , i foresaw this . i knew -
i guess i got carried away
enjoyed it ?
i do n't know what to say . look , i -- i just -
whoever comes up with that will make woodward and bernstein look like abbot and costello .
he is . usually .
if one of you can get that -- i mean , i want the real superman . who is he ? where 's he from ? what 's his favorite ball team ? what 's up ?
i was going to say that there 's only one 'p ' in subpoena . what the hell did you major in at radcliffe ? middle english ? nice job on the teamster 's update , kent .
nine to five it 's a pulitzer prize , i know .
lois , the kickback story ...
okay , but ... why ? no offense .
lois , take kent there and introduce him around
it does , huh ? clark kent , i 'd like you to meet lois lane .
here 's the story on that east 19th street murder spree . page one with a banner headline seems about right to me .
well , i was born on a planet your scientists do n't know too much about . it 's in the xeno galaxy . or it was . it was called krypton . that 's k-r-y-p ...
where do you hail from ?
very much .
do you like pink ?
sure .
can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound ?
pink .
what color underwear am i wearing ?
only when somebody shoots them at me .
do bullets really bounce off you ?
yes . although i can get a headache just like anyone .
is it true you 're impervious to pain ?
uh-huh .
can you really see through anything ?
what about it ?
what about this x-ray vision of yours ?
195 pounds .
how much do you weigh ?
thirty-five .
how old are you ?
it 's not bad .
it must feel great .
the reason i can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that i have a lighter density under earth 's gravitational force .
oh .
i would n't do that . it 's against the law .
well , i mean it 's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it .
i guess they are a little odd .
i did n't mean that in any pejorative way .
you think they 're strange ?
okay . let 's start with these strange powers of yours .
ask , you 're the girl reporter .
oh . well , where do we start ?
i 'd appreciate it if you did n't smoke .
oh , i 've got to get some matches . my cigarette .
not exactly . he 's kind of a rewrite man . actually , he 's a bit dull , if you know what i mean .
who 's clark ? one of your colleagues ?
if i do , you can punish me . fly me to bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks . this is fantastic ! i wish clark were here .
i think you 'll be able to remember it . i doubt you 'll misquote me .
well ... flashlight ?
unlisted number , shall we proceed ?
this is incredible . i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you . i mean , you do n't have an answering service , right ?
there 's been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what i 'm up to and all that . i 'd like to set the record straight . with your help .
the answer is yes . now what 's the question ?
i came to talk to you .
wha ' ... what are you doing here ?
right on the first guess .
superman ? ? ?
not a chance . it 's too nice a night .
with my luck , now it 'll rain .
let 's just say i 'm a friend . and watch yourself from now on with those things , okay ? i mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings .
who ... who ...
not while i 'm around you 're not . c'mon ...
oh , god ! i 'm going to die !
do as i say . let go !
you 've got me ? who 's got you ? ? ?
easy now , miss , i 've got you ? ? ?
good enough for you . now then -- -- tell me something i like to hear . as many times as i hear it ...
sort of .
ah , dear simple otis . albert explain it to him .
i still do n't get it .
oh , mr. luthor ...
cleaning a rock , otis ? jot it down . as soon as we 're back , he feeds the pets .
maybe it 's being polished or something . maybe they 're cleaning it .
they 're killing me by inches ! go ahead ! make me suffer ! milk me dry .
it 's a twinkie , boss .
well , gents ? what did i tell you ? it 's a piece of cake .
will kill him ! and i 'm going to have a piece of the rock ! miss teschmacher , pack your --
you mean bullets and fire and all that ca n't hurt him , but this kind of rock --
but , to someone from the planet krypton , this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity . kryptonite ! ah , kryptonite ! that 's the stuff !
y'know ? i 'm sure of it . y'know ? and there 's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if i do n't do something about it . something !
it is for me .
is that real enough for you ?
otis ...
please ...
i guess i ... uh ... regressed .
and now he lies to me . he has been stealing ladies ' purses again . have n't you ? have n't you , you miserable petty crook ?
i ... uh ... check .
i gave him this new face .
i 'll never forget you for that , mr. luthor .
i gave him steady employment --
i 'll always be grateful , mr. luthor .
i broke the man out of prison --
otis , were you up to your old tricks ?
matter ? with me ? nothing 's the matter .
what 's the matter , otis ?
excellent , otis . but what took you so long ?
did i do good , mr. luthor ?
not there ! a pine tree in death valley ? idiot ! this is for the north woods section !
there .
yessir . just what you wanted .
now then , otis . did you get what i asked for ?
no speeches , otis . just watch what albert has prepared . what are you waiting for ?
i ... uh ...
we 'll see how fast i can fly .
now who 's the dreamer , superman ? even you ca n't fly that fast !
for the first time today , superman i must tell you that you 're wrong . but how could you know that - oh , well . i guess i could tell you now . y'see , actually ... but this conversation is becoming rather dry , is n't it .
well , it 's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing .
in a way -- oh , it 'll be a relief . i 'm a wreck . no rest for the wicked , y'know . it was n't enough , the radio frequencies , then i had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming . so that if i could have activated the launch -- well , lex luthor would 've hit the spot . there 's a little place on route 190. dead on the practice optimum stress point of the san andreas fault . it would n't mean much to you , superman , but i call it ... target zero . pancho 's taco palace ...
they 'll soon be over .
well , that 's their problem , t.s . but -- but the xk 101 also works on a radio wave control system . the problem was to find out the frequency . problems , problems , i 've had so many ...
you guessed it ! you 're always one step ahead of me . are n't you superman ? yes , right . there was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors . the minute the signal went out -- zip ! zip ! zip !
luthor --
and garbage doors .
on radio waves ?
still , foolishly , perhaps , i had a theory that eliminates the presidential push-button . i was doing my homework ...
i know . i know . i never promised myself a rose garden .
the xk 101. luthor , that operates on radio waves . and with our fail-safe system , only the president himself can push that button .
you 're right , you 're right , superman . there were wrinkles to iron out . but , well ... ... there is this new rocket , the xk 101 .
it would n't hurt . you ca n't go on living in fantasies . did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb ? and drop it ? why , our strategic defense boys would have --
maybe i should get help .
it would never have worked , luthor . you are a dreamer -- a sick , twisted dreamer .
-- dropped into the sea ! bye-bye california ! hello , new west coast ! gold coast ! my coast . and now ... well ... i left my heart in san francisco ...
nice ! most of california would have been destroyed . millions of people would 've been killed ! the west coast as we know it would have --
could n't have said it better myself . now all this -- -- west of the fault is the most expensive real estate in the world . los angeles . san diego . san francisco . and here -- -- is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land . land that happens to be owned by lex luthor enterprises . well ... ... call me a fool , but ... it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point -- -- that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the san andreas fault to 'do its thing . ' ah , it would 've been so nice , y'know ...
sure . it 's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago . the fault line itself is unstable and always shifting , which is the reason you get earthquakes in the california area from time to time .
at the san andreas fault . maybe you 've heard of it .
right , right . where was i ? ah , yes --
of time , luthor .
it 's just that -- i spent a fortune on these things ! and all for naught ! what a waste --
no , superman , of course not . you do get around , do n't you .
i do n't need a geography lesson , luthor .
this is california . the richest , most populous state in america . and growing like a sonofagun .
oh , that . listen -- you 're busy -- and it 's a long story --
plenty ! about 'the crime of the century , ' remember ?
well -- you 've got me ! what can i say ?
but ... why ?
makes cecil b. demille look like the senior class play , right ?
what is this ? ? !
i 'll tell her that .
i hope she gets better .
i will .
say hi to zoe .
alison .
alison .
mitchell . it was nice to see you again , ally .
well , it was nice meeting you again , mr. stephens .
nothing . we made it to the hospital . i did n't have to go as far as i was prepared to . but i was prepared to go all the way .
what happened ?
i did n't know . i was in a panic . i guessed she 'd been bitten by an insect , but there was no doctor . the nearest hospital was forty miles away , and zoe was continuing to swell . klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her , while i dialed the hospital . i finally got a doctor on the line . he sounded young , but cool . he was confident , but there was a nervousness . he have been an intern . this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this . he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing , but he was just as scared as i was .
what happened ?
i woke to the sound of zoe 's breathing . it was laboured . i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen . i grabbed her , rushed to the kitchen , and splashed water on her face .
i ... do n't think so .
that 's okay .
i 'm ... so sorry .
it turns to steaming piss .
what ... does it turn to ?
yes . do you find there 's something strange about this meat ?
she 's in trouble ?
that 's where i 'm going . to see her .
but you said ...
she did n't .
then ... when did she get better ?
other clinics ? oh sure . clinics , half-way houses , treatment centers , detox units ...
so there were others ?
sunnyridge . that was a long time
i do n't remember the name . it was near a beach .
which clinic ?
which one ?
which one ?
not really . the last time i saw her was at that clinic . that was a long time ago .
are you still in touch ?
i 'm glad to hear that zoe 's okay .
and zoe ? how 's zoe ?
yes ... fine .
i 'd heard that . but she 's well ?
we 're ... not together .
how is mrs. stephens ?
ally jones .
he used to work with you . until you found out he was having an affair with your wife .
and what does he do again ?
i 'm fine . still working with my father .
i 'm just fine , ally . what about you ?
how are you ?
ally . that 's right .
ally . that was my nickname .
yes .
alison jones .
yes , we do know each other . i 'm alison jones .
i 'm telling you this because we 've all lost our children , mr. ansel ...
why are you telling me this ?
that 's my daughter . or it may be the police to tell me that they 've found her dead . she 's a drug addict .
i 'm telling you this because ... we 've all lost our children , mr. ansel .
why are you telling me this ?
that 's my daughter . or it may be the police to tell me that they 've found her dead . she 's a drug addict .
i know risa and wendell walker . they would n't hire a goddamned lawyer . and the ottos would n't deal
the walkers have agreed . the ottos . nicole burnell 's parents . it 's important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that 's why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears . that 's why i 'm out here tonight .
case ?
you can help each other . several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit . your case as an individual will be stronger if i 'm allowed to represent you together as a group .
leave us alone , stephens . leave the people of this town alone . you ca n't help .
no , mr. ansel . i would n't sue you .
mr. mitchell stephens , esquire , would you be likely to sue me if i was to beat you right now ? beat you so bad that you pissed blood and could n't walk for a month . because that 's what i 'm about to do .
not unless you can raise the dead .
i can help you .
no you do n't .
i understand .
mister , i do n't want to know your name .
my name is ...
goodnight , nicole .
goodnight , mr. ansel .
oh . right .
i 'm not sure .
what do you mean 'outgrown it ' ?
and she really liked you . she would 've given you all this if she 'd outgrown it , or ...
no . i mean , i remember mrs. ansel wearing some of this stuff , but ... i do n't feel funny about that . i really liked her .
nicole , i 'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity . do n't feel bad . unless you feel strange about wearing it .
i do n't know .
why ?
it just seems ... kind of weird .
yeah .
are you sure ?
okay .
i 'll be back around nine .
was it good ?
they just finished supper .
hi , mr. ansel . hi , jessica , mason ...
hi , nicole .
say hello for me .
she 's resting . in her room .
how is nicole ? is she around ?
the children .
billy , please . the children .
i used to like it here . i used to care about what happened . now i think i 'll sell my house and move the fuck away .
because i was driving behind the bus , mary . because i saw it . i saw it happen ...
why would he do that ? you did n't have anything to do with the accident .
i 'm sorry .
i 'll help pay for nicole , if that 's what you 're really talking about . i 'll even give you the money i got for my kids . that 's what we used to do , remember ? help each other . this was a community .
it 's not enough . for hospital bills . for nicole .
why ? you got money from dolores ' insurance with the school board . we all did .
no , billy . we ca n't drop the lawsuit . you know how much we need the money .
we 've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards . we 've got people pointing fingers , making side deals , and dickering over percentages . yesterday , i heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad . the rescue squad . because they did n't act fast enough .
c'mon , you know that wo n't ...
that 's wrong , sam . you know that . we 'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years . this is never going to go away ...
that wo n't happen , billy . mitch stephens ' case is small , compared to some of those other guys . the way he told me , all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day , driving behind the bus . i know it 's a painful thing to do , but it 'll only take a few minutes of your time . that 'll be the end of it .
if that bastard does subpoena me , if he forces me to go over this again , then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing .
but yours is the one who 's going to subpoena me , sam . force me to testify in court . he came by the garage this afternoon . gave me this piece of paper .
so ? i mean , lot 's of folks have got lawyers .
i 've tried to stay out of it . but it turns out that 's not so easy , sam . you 've gone and got yourself this lawyer . mitchell stephens . you and risa and wendell and the ottos .
okay , fine . so ... stay out of it .
well i do n't want a damned thing to do with it .
because it 's what we have to do .
why not ?
well , it being so depressing and all . but it 's reality . you ca n't just turn this off because you happen to think it 's a bad idea .
how ?
well , i do n't know why it should . there 's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits . we 're hardly unique here , billy . i mean , i can understand how you feel .
it does concern me .
i do n't see how that concerns you , billy .
well , sam , i might as well tell you the truth . it 's this lawsuit you 've gotten yourself all involved with . i want you to drop the damned thing .
so what brings you out tonight ?
you think that caused the accident , risa ? that it brought bad luck ? christ , it sounds to me you 're looking for a witch doctor , not a lawyer . or maybe they 're the same thing .
why did you do that , billy ?
yes .
is it true that you gave nicole one of lydia 's dresses ? that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ?
well i do n't .
because i have to .
why ?
i have to .
you believe that ?
... or that the guardrail was n't strong enough .
risa , i serviced that bus . at the garage . there 's nothing wrong with it .
mr. stephens says that someone did n't put a right bolt in the bus ...
something made this happen , billy . mr. stephens is going to find out what it was .
i stopped by the station a while ago . i stared at the bus . i could almost hear the kids inside . there was a lawyer there . he told me he 'd gotten you signed up . is that true ?
good night .
good night , billy .
i better get back .
you 're leaving .
just like we look forward to this .
sure .
they can look forward to that .
well , maybe that 's because they know i 'm going to follow them . behind the bus .
your kids never cry .
it 's natural .
yes .
that 's because he misses you .
tomorrow i 'm going to put sean on the bus . he wo n't want to go . he never does . he 'll cry and want to hold on to me .
what are you thinking ?
when the game 's over , i guess .
what time 's he coming home ?
no . it should be dry by now .
does this mean i ca n't take a shower ?
billy , do you have to smoke ? wendell can smell if someone 's been smoking .
a while .
have you been waiting long ?
ca n't you make it later ?
she said she 's got to be home by nine .
billy , that 's too early .
nicole 's coming over to look after the kids tonight . she 'll be there around six .
i do n't know . but it was weird in terms of what happened next . sean was still watching his mother .
why would he be frightened ?
he never took his eyes off his mother , even as he moved to sit beside nicole . he looked frightened .
yes . abbot understands these things .
that 's what he said , is it ?
there might have been a word or two that slipped by . maybe you could clarify it for me , just to be absolutely sure .
anything you did n't understand ?
yes .
you heard what abbott said ?
who 's been talking to you about what i 'm feeling ? who should care about what i 'm feeling ?
excuse me ?
what other people ?
it 's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event .
mrs. driscoll , if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court , i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect .
and billy told you that he 'll tell that to ...
i did .
you 've talked to billy ?
billy said that ?
yes . he does .
he knows that ? billy ?
billy ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour . just like you 've done every morning for the past fifteen years .
because i 'd be to blame , right ?
that would complicate things .
i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened . that 's how i remembered it . but the truth is , i might have been doing sixty . or sixty five . and if that 's true , that i was over the limit when the bus went over , what would happen then ?
what 's that , dolores ?
i have a question for you , mr. stephens .
the walkers loved sean . he was their only child ... the object of all their attention . i mean , wendell 's a withdrawn sort of man . that 's his nature . but risa , she 's still got dreams .
did they give him special care ?
what do you mean ?
did his parents attend to that ?
that 's right .
you mentioned that he had a learning disability .
what do you mean ?
were his parents ... attentive to him ?
a strange little fellow , but you could n't help liking him . he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six .
with our hands .
and what 's that ?
yes . the old-fashioned way .
berry-picking .
abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring .
yes . like i was putting them into my big basket . clearing the hillside of its children .
berries .
that 's the way i thought of them sometimes .
no . i saw it on his face .
you talked about it ?
no , nothing like that . billy 's wife , lydia , died of cancer a few years ago . he took over raising the children by himself . it was obvious how much he missed lydia .
did he have any particular problems that you knew of ? financial pressures ... run-ins with the law ...
from what ?
from what ?
billy loved to see his kids in the bus . they always sat in the back , so they could wave to each other . it comforted him .

for rabbits ?
those are all from the fair last year . abbott and me were judges at the pet show .
oh yes . like i said , they always came out together to see him off to school . it 's like he was their little treasure . he was such a beautiful boy . that 's a picture of him on the wall there , behind abbott .
and they loved bear .
no , nothing like that . the ottos are what i 'd call model citizens . they 're regular at town meetings . they give their opinions in a respectful way . they always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they are n't church goers .
do they have any reputation for drugs ?
i mean , the way they look . their hair and clothing ...
yes . what do you mean by 'hippies ' ?
about the ottos ?
what do you mean by that , dolores ?
dolores . no one calls me 'mrs . driscoll ' .
the ottos always waited for the bus with bear . they were the only parents who did that , together like that . i guess they 're what you might call hippies .
away from your crazy mom .
oh , it 's bizarre alright . c'mon bear . let 's get you out of here .
it 's for the school bazaar .
i 'll just strap it on the roof .
i could wrap it up . protect the other kids .
i did n't say that .
you hate it .
well , it 's certainly what you 'd call interesting .
what do you think ?
hi , dolores .
good morning , wanda . hi , hartley .
i 'll ... take it straight .
we 've only got honey .
no . a little sugar though .
i did n't ask if you wanted milk .
how long has dolores been driving that bus , mr. otto ? how many times has she steered clear of danger ? what went wrong that morning ?
but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to ...
a cup of tea would be nice . would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes , mrs. otto ? i want to talk to you .
you want a cup of tea or something ?
it 's the truth .
nicole !
no . what 's this lawyer business ?
maybe we should n't be talking about this just now , with you barely home . are n't you hungry , honey ? want me to fix you something ?
who 's mr. stephens ?
no . from mr. stephens . that was him on the phone just now . he was calling to see how you were .
from you ?
yes . it 's a present .
is this mine ?
i feel like a princess .
your dad spent all his spare time in here . he wanted to make it absolutely perfect .
it 's interesting .
so do you like your new room ?
we had a terrible winter last year , did n't we , sam ?
how was it ?
well , winter 's far behind us now .
and winter ?
summer 's over . it 's fall .
what happened to summer ?
is n't it a lovely day ?
he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein . it was n't . i feel like his monster .
would you like a cup of tea , billy ? there 's a piece of cake left .
hey , billy ! what brings you out on a night like this ? c'mon in . take a load off .
that 's what he said .
is he coming over now ? right away ?
jenny , it 's time for you to go to bed .
was he drinking ? could you tell ?
no .
did he say what about ?
that was billy ansel on the phone . he wants to come over to talk to us .
okay .
should i keep reading ?
oh .
no . not mean . just ... very angry .
so he was mean ?
yes .
the people in the town ?
because ... he wanted to them to be punished .
well , if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why could n't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats ?
that 's right .
what , mason ?
nicole ?
okay .
i want to sit beside you tomorrow .
do n't you usually like to sit at the back ? to wave at your dad ?
can i sit beside you on the bus tomorrow ?
yes .
nicole ?
rats ! they fought the dogs and killed the cats , and bit the babies in the cradles , and ate the cheeses out of vats . and licked the soup from the cook 's own ladles , split open the kegs of salted sprats , made nests inside men 's sunday hats , and even spoiled the women 's chats , by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats ...
what 's vermin again ?
oh .
it 's like a song .
what 's a ditty again ?
the pied piper of hamelin . by famous hanover city ; the river weser , deep and wide , washes its wall on the southern side ; a pleasanter spot you never spied ; but , when begins my ditty ...
unless the report from the national weather bureau for the district on january 23 goes into the record , i will object to that question .
it was snowing .
so you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this . it 's not going to be easy , nicole . do you understand that ?
why ?
yes . dolores ... and even your mom and dad . but i 'll make sure you go last .
dolores .
i 'm absolutely positive .
you seem very sure about that .
there 's no such thing as an accident , nicole . not in a situation like this .
the truth is that it was an accident , and no one 's to blame .
i do n't want you to lie .
i wo n't lie .
they work for the people we 're trying to sue . their job is to try to minimize damages . our job , nicole , is to try to maximize them . you have to think of it that way . as people doing their jobs . no good guys or bad guys . just our side and their side .
what do you want me to do for you , mr. stephens ?
it would be strange if you did n't feel that way .
yes . like bear and the ansel twins and sean and ...
that you did n't die ? like the other children ?
you can only feel lucky that you did n't die for so long . then you start to feel ... unlucky .
you hate that .
i do n't like thinking about the accident . i do n't even remember it happening . besides , it just makes people feel sorry for me , and ...
thank you , nicole .
i have no questions .
and what was the weather like at this time ?
note that she said 'pretty clearly ' . not 'clearly ' .
did there come a time when the bus turned off staples mill road onto
note my objection . she said , 'as i 'm talking . '
i object to that form of question . note that .
there was nothing reckless in mrs. driscoll 's behavior ?
was the bus on time ?
i object to the form of that question . note that .
no .
have they ever been busted ?
wanda does these photographic things . that 's one of her pictures on the wall .
crafts ?
crafts .
what do they do ?
they 're smart . been to college . they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago .
that 's good . judges like adopted indian boys . tell me more about the ottos .
yes .
indian ?
wanda and hartley . they lost bear . he was their adopted son . a beautiful boy . indian .
tell me about the ottos .
there 's the prescots ...
that 's great , wendell . that 's the sort of thing i need to know . so it does n't come back to haunt our case later on .
people who will help our cause .
what do you mean ?
... coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that ... and ...
that 's the local bar ?
at school . she fell for kyle just before we graduated . got pregnant , and ... went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot kyle 's dad used to own . kyle started spending more and more time at the spread eagle ...
when ?
she ... she was a friend of mine .
what about doreen ?
hard to say . i might have ... some business here .
will you be spending more than a night ?
do you have a room ?
thanks .
here we go .
perfect .
is this it ?
almost three .
how old is she ?
tell me about it .
you always think you 're prepared for these things .
sure , it you could find a towel in this bag . i know my wife packed one in there ...
need a hand ?
i love you , zoe . i 'll be there soon , and i 'll take care of you . no matter what happens . i 'll take care of you .
oh god , i 'm scared .
yes . i can hear you breathing too .
i can hear you breathing , daddy .
of ... course i do . i just thought ... i could get you another
you do n't believe me ? you do n't fucking believe me ?
do you have the blood test ?
you ca n't ask me that ! not anymore ! you asked me what i wanted . not what i wanted it for . i want money .
what for ?
i need money .
what do you want me to do , zoe ? i 'll do whatever you want .
welcome to hard times , daddy .
yes .
i tested positive .
yes .
do you know what that means , daddy ? does it register ?
no . but this is . they would n't take my blood .
that 's not news , zoe .
okay . i went to sell blood yesterday . that 's how it is . i 'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer , and i 'm selling my blood .
tell me your news , zoe .
you always think you know what i 'm going to say , do n't you ? you always think you 're two steps ahead of me . the lawyer .
yes . give me your news , zoe .
do n't you want to hear ?
news ?
i 'm calling because i 've got some news for you , daddy . some big news .
yes .
daddy ?
yes , i 'll accept the charges .
i ... i just need to know what state you 're in so i know ... how to talk to you ... how to act ...
why ca n't you talk to me ?
yes .
daddy ! ! !
'cause you think i 'm stoned , daddy ? 'cause you think i 've got a needle stuck in my arm ? is that what you 're thinking , daddy ?
the problem is i have no idea who i 'm talking to right now .
so what 's the problem ?
nothing 's wrong with trying to talk to me , zoe .
why am i calling you ? you 're my father . i 'm not supposed to call you ? what 's the matter with wanting to talk to you , daddy ?
why are you calling me , zoe ?
remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window ? how old was i , daddy ? five or six ? i got absolutely soaked , remember ?
a car wash ! wow , i 've never talked to you when you 've been in a car wash. make sure you 've got the windows closed .
i 'm in a car wash .
well , let 's see what we get .
i 'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate .
if you could pick the shrimp off , as well as anything that touches the shrimp ...
yes .
is there shrimp on it ?
we do .
poached salmon .
what is it ?
i 'm sorry about that , mr. stephens . would you like to try the fish ?
i 'm afraid this meat is overdone .
some more wine ?
do you have this agreement with you ?
if you agree to have me represent you in this suit , i will require no payment until after the case is won , when i will require one third of the awarded amount . if there is no award made , then my services will cost you nothing . it 's a standard agreement .
no .
are you expensive ?
listen to me , mrs otto . listen very carefully . i do know what 's best .
is n't that what you want us to believe ? that we 're completely defenseless ? that you know what 's best ?
excuse me ?
so you 're just the thing we need .
mrs. otto , there is no such thing as an accident . the word does n't mean anything to me . as far as i 'm concerned , somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner . some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement . they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference . that 's what 's done , mrs. otto . i 've seen it happen so many times before .
you think someone else caused the accident ?
it 's my belief that dolores was doing exactly what she 'd been doing for years . besides , the school board 's insurance on dolores is minimal . a few million at the very most . the really deep pockets are to be found in the town , or in the company that made the bus .
dolores ?
you are angry , are n't you , mrs. otto ? that 's why i 'm here . to give your anger a voice . to be your
who did they get for that ?
it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger . not their grief .
their child died , and they got a lawyer .
yes .
you 've been retained ?
the walkers spoke very highly of you .
please .
no .
please , let me explain . i 'll only take a moment of your time .
you ca n't come here .
i 'm a lawyer .
who are you ?
i 'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this , mrs. otto , but the walkers said you would understand . i know it 's an awful time , but it 's important that we talk .
do n't know . food banks , welfare , church charity . they scrape by .
how does the family survive ?
ca n't get off that shitty dump they live on . what little money comes in goes to booze .
probably half a dozen traffic convictions . drunk driving . lost his licence . that 's why he do n't work no more .
any criminal record ?
been drinking since high school . fucked himself up . used to be smart enough .
in what way ?
kyle lambston 's a drunk . nobody likes him . he 's a nasty piece of work .
no .
are you a reporter ?
i remember the bus swerved , it just suddenly swerved to the right , and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road , and then it went over the embankment there , and everyone was screaming and everything . and that 's all . i guess i was unconscious after that . that 's all . then i was in the hospital .
what do you remember about the accident ?
yes . i do now . now that i 'm telling it .
you remember this ?
no . because the bus went off the road . and crashed .
there was n't time ?
i was scared . and there was n't time .
why not ?
no .
did you say anything to mrs. driscoll ?
yes .
you saw the speedometer ?
i told you i was positive . the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was .
you believe that the bus driven by mrs. driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time ?
positive .
seventy-two miles an hour ? you 're sure of this ?
seventy-two miles an hour .
how fast would you say mrs. driscoll was going ? to the best of your recollection ?
yes . i looked . i remember clearly now . it seemed we were going too fast down the hill . i was scared .
you could see the speedometer ?
the speedometer . and it was downhill there .
mrs. driscoll was driving too fast ? what made you think that , nicole ?
dolores was driving too fast .
why were you scared ?
yes , i understand .
this is before the accident , nicole . do you understand what i 'm asking ?
why were you scared ?
i was scared .
yes .
before the actual accident ?
i will offer that report . well , then , now that your memory seems to be clearing , can you tell us what else you observed at that time ?
yes .
you are ?
there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there , right by the dump , and dolores slowed down not to hit him , and he ran into the woods . and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road , as usual . i remember that . i 'm remembering it pretty clearly .
yes .
as i 'm talking , i 'm remembering more about it .
you remember that much ?
yes .
did there come a time when all the children had been picked up ?
no .
until the accident ? no . yes , there was .
and according to your recollection , there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning ?
my usual place . on the right side . the first seat .
and where did you sit that morning ?
yes .
like what ? i mean , i do n't remember a lot .
was there anything unusual about the driver , dolores driscoll , or the bus that particular morning ?
no . i was alone . my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day .
was anyone waiting for the bus with you ?
about eight-thirty in the morning .
what time in the morning was this ?
yes .
now on that morning , did there come a time , nicole , when you left your parents ' house ?
someplace where no one knows her . someplace strange and new .
there 's talk of that .
she 'll move away .
it 's too late for that . she ca n't drive the bus anymore . the school board saw to that right off .
will the police do anything to her ?
i do n't know .
what 's going to happen to dolores ?
okay .
how about sunday night ? that 's always the best time .
yes .
great .
well , okay . i 'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning . that 's okay with you ?
he could n't look at me . but i looked at him . right at him . his secret was mine now . we used to share it . but not anymore . now , i owned it completely .
i mean i 'm a wheelchair girl now . it 's hard to pretend i 'm a beautiful rock star . not like you used to tell me . remember , daddy ? all the people that were going to discover me ? where are they now ?
what do you mean ?
you seem ... i do n't know ... well , distant , i guess . hard to talk to .
great .
nicole , tomorrow mr. stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse . i thought i 'd take you over .
no .
are you sleeping ?
as opposed to this t.v . ?
nothing good on your t.v . ?
nothing .
what are you up to , nicole ?
well , mr. stephens is representing several families . the ottos , the walkers , us , and i think a couple more . mr. stephens is suing the town for negligence . he 's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right . he 's a very smart man .
how will he do that ?
partly . but there 's a lot the insurance does n't cover . that 's one of the reasons we have a lawyer . to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest .
what about insurance ? does n't insurance pay for these things ?
you 're going to need special care for a long time to come . it 's not going to be easy . not for you , not for any of us . because we love you so much . and it 's going to cost money . more than we can imagine .
but you did n't lose me .
it 's because of the accident , nicole . most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers . a lot of people ... well , people in this town are very angry . us included .
my lawyer ? why do i need a lawyer ?
well , yes . he 's your lawyer too .
you and mom have a lawyer ?
he 's a lawyer . he 's our lawyer .
oh . i better get some spackle .
that 's too high . i 'll never reach it .
sure . i 'll fix it right away .
the door needs a lock .
and i had to widen a few doors . you 'll see .
it 's okay .
do you like the colour ?
very slick .
pretty slick , eh ?
the ramp ?
how do you like it , nicole ?
do n't even try to remember .
they say i 'm lucky because i ca n't remember the accident .
does it fit ?
mrs. ansel 's clothing .
what 's that ?
nothing .
what took so long ?
just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals . it 's like the biggest thing in her life .
what 's so funny ?
i am . really . it was awesome .
you do n't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure .
of course .
you mean it ?
you 're going to blow everyone away .
really ?
that was great .
you do n't know that .
yeah , well , they probably smoke weed .
the ottos .
do n't even think of the bilodeaus or the atwaters . they 're all inbred .
charlene 's over at the spread eagle every other night . sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on . she 'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts .
but charlene ...
that sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town . he 's about to lose his house and car .
yeah , right .
well , there 's the hamiltons . joe and shelly hamilton .
that 's the horse ! shotgun - shotgun in the fifth !
waiter , the check . this man is trying to hold a gun to my head !
where are we running ? what am i missing here ?
hitler !
will you mind your own business !
oh , are you a spy for the other side ?
that 's right ! tell him , so i can read it in hunsecker 's column first !
it 's compensation , leo , for the marginal life we lead . sidney , did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
you ought to stop this nonsense , loretta , these two dollar bets .
how do you do , mr. falco . if you know anything about horses , sit a minute . help yourself to a glass of this n.y. state champagne - that 's what my husband buys me .
loretta ... sidney falco ...
thanks , i see him ...
he 's somewhere ...
yeah , having supper with the mrs. she 's over there .
just hopping tonight . leo bartha been in ?
hello , sidney . wan na table ?
a senator , an agent and something - with - long - red - hair .
alone or surrounded ?
but of course ...
is `` he '' inside ?
how are you tonight , mr. falco ?
i doubt that it matters any more .
i could think of better places to meet her , instead of here . he lives on the whole top floor .
i guess you 're right , but -
not that i 'm convinced , but you 'll never prove it in a million years . steve , you 'll do what you want , but it ca n't hurt ; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives !
i still think he 's responsible for the smear .
we 're on our way there now ...
i want to speak to miss hunsecker , please .
... excited with good reason , i wanted to say . because this endangers the future of the whole quintet ...
do n't apologize for me , frank !
boys , this gets nobody nowhere - you 're over excited , steve and -
i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated .
excuse me , steve . i said namely you should n't go around wild , blaming people without justification .
you do n't like it , do you . i think she will accept , but i 'm not sure . she may be too dependent on her brother .
did she accept ?
the next time you want information , falco , do n't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man !
come on boys , break it up ...
then what are you doing here ? go over there and fight ! if van cleve fires your boy , it gives a lie the ring of truth !
... people catch on quick to such an item . van cleve already called me - he 's firing the quintet .
i do n't like this threatening attitude . when it comes to it , what the heck is it your business what they do , this boy and girl ...
listen , frank , you 'd better make sure you 're telling me the truth .
four five nights ago . that 's how i know the romance is off . also steve 's in a very bad mood .
that 's a nice tour . all booked ? when was susie around here last ?
coupla weeks . for eight weeks .
when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road ?
not in those exact words - you know what a temper he 's got .
you told him that ?
yeah , and it 's the truth , to the best of my knowledge . and , frankly , i 'm glad . for steve 's sake , i 'm glad , not yours . i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart . steve should n't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age .
you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker , did n't you ?
looka , sidney , you 're my own sister 's son , but where does that give you the right to call me a liar ?
frank , i think maybe you lied to me .
robard 's my client . i did it for him and his club , not your boys .
thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow .
i only had a few hours .
see my mother ?
went over to philly yesterday an ' seen the folks ... it 's nice you send them the fifty a month ...
and with ten percent of his future , you 're great , too , frank .
that 's a lollipop that , boy . the kid is only great .
your nephew does n't want a drink .
joe , give my nephew a drink .
hurry back .
blessings on thee , the both ... well ... got ta run now . see you two kids later !
give me a chance --
i hate j.j. -- but not that much at this moment ...
right !
otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you . tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what . right , otis ?
friends call me otis - sometimes tricky otis .
i see you 're full of human feelings ...
and , instead , he printed his heel in your face ?
you do n't know that lunatic yet ? whims - egotistic whims ! like the gag - when you got him for a friend , you do n't need an enemy ! that 's what the fight with bartha was about . `` leo '' , i says , `` hunsecker froze me out . so i 'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item . ''
if it were that easy , you would n't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours ...
call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock .
how is dear old j.j. by the way ?
i 'm late for a date with a dame .
i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper . hey , wait a minute !
ten 'll get you fifty you 're playing hookey from a padded cell !
but my day with susie is n't over yet and --
son , i do n't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns . so suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day ...
why ? because i do n't like the way you toy with human lives ? - your contempt and malice ? because i wo n't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it 's crippled susie ... ? you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory ... but to me , and thousands of others like me , you and your slimy scandal , your phony patriotics - to me , mr. hunsecker , you are a national disgrace !
and what have i done to her , besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ? sidney , you were right -- the boy 's a dilly .
no , i do n't care about you -- you 're fantastic . my whole interest , if it 's not too late , is in susie ... and how to undo what you 've done to her ...
if looks could kill , i 'm dead ...
son , you raise your voice again and you 'll be outa here on your golden pratt !
i 'm trying to get susie to stand up to you . but your manner is so threatening that she 's afraid to speak !
may i lift my eyebrows ? what is this ? what are you trying to do ?
those `` dears '' sound like daggers . may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak ?
susie , as always , is free to say anything she thinks . go on , dear , say exactly what 's on your mind , dear .
i 'm afraid i ca n't cope with them .
you hear that , susie ... continue please ...
mr. hunsecker , you 've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels .
wait a minute , i have n't handed over punishing privileges to you yet ! put the whip down and i might respect what you 're saying ...
right now you 're in no position to ask questions ! and your snide remarks -- -
i do n't take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics . who 's the injured party here , you ?
he 's here , is n't he ? do you think , sir , when he dies he 'll go to the dog and cat heaven ?
why do you keep coupling me with falco ?
no punch line . maybe i was just admiring your know-how -- -yours and falco 's .
frankly , son , you lost me on that last hill . just give us the punch line ...
well , just be careful you do n't knock her down , huh ?
nuts ! i 'm not here as an artist ! i 'm here as an average joe , who happens to love your sister susie !
just exactly what are you so hot about ? i mean , i know it 's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds , but --
son , lots of people tell me i 'm a gifted man , but i still ca n't see around corners .
is it news to you ?
why , has he bothered you before ?
does he have to be here in our hair ?
serious as a deacon ... i like it . i like your style , son ! in a world of old rags and bones , i like it ! for instance , take sidney .
no , i would n't ...
take it easy , susie . he would n't be much of a man if he did n't understand my concern . would you , son ?
i 'll by that , son . now , you owe me a favor . be good to my kid sister ...
mr. hunsecker , there 's nothing to that smear . you have my sincere word ...
you 've been very kind about it , mr. hunsecker . hunsecker give susie credit for that . i took her word that there was nothing to the smear . matter of fact , i 'll have my say about smears on the show today . that 's why i 'd like your personal assurance , too .
well , son , looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble ...
susan ! ...
no ! no ! do n't touch me !
no . i 'm going home .
you in a mood , susie , to run over to milgrim 's later and buy a few new frocks ?
sometimes i think all men are fools ! ...
susie , i 'm sorry if -- -
before you leave , son , i 'll answer your question -- -susan hunsecker is the injured party here ! or will i be hearing next that i do n't even have my sister 's welfare at heart ...
no ...
susie , did you know about this accusation ... ?
j.j. , steve is n't ...
susie likes to keep her girlish secrets . but in her heart of hearts i imagine , dallas , that she fancies you in an uncommon way . now , what about you , son ? not just tom-catting around ... i hope ?
a man could n't ask for a squarer shake . let me have billy van cleve ... do n't ever tell anyone , susie , how i 'm tied to your apron strings ... billy ! j.j. ! what 's this about that boy ? what boy ? where are we , lug , in a drawing room comedy ? you 're brain is warming up , sweetheart - yeah , dallas ! ... no , do n't explain your point of view , but ...
when i 'm certain , i 'll let you know ...
susie , i want to help you -- , there 's nothing i wo n't do for you . you 're all i 've got in the whole , wide world .
i 'm taking up the situation with you now ...
i started to say we 're drifting apart . a year ago , in your wildest dreams , would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me ? today i had to call you in !
i have n't said anything yet , j.j. , but if -
let me finish , dear . you had your say , now let me have mine ...
i thought we were talking about sidney ?
you know , dear , we 're drifting apart , you and i , and i do n't like that .
i said sidney ! ...
who said sidney ?
sidney is a liar !
alan was not ... unbalanced when i married him . and he was not ... 'indifferent to women ' no matter what they said ! hunsecker i 'm not fighting with you , puss ...
i would n't have called the boy exactly balanced ...
then whose fault was it , j.j. ? it was someone 's fault , was n't it ?
but that was n't your fault , dear , what happened to leslie . i 've told you that a million times ...
it 's just as if i 've seen a ghost today ...
history repeats itself . everything that happened to alan leslie ... began with a smear like this ...
why are you trembling , dear ... ?
no , i 'm not . i 'm not !
not being partial , are you ?
yes , he phoned . i do n't know this boy too well . anything in these charges ?
did sidney tell you about it ?
what a question , dear , with that newspaper in your hand ...
why ?
susie , you 're very much in my thoughts today .
why does everything you say sound like a threat ?
we 're friends , harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid congressman , do n't we ?
there is some allusion here that escapes me ...
this man is not for you , harvey , and you should n't be seen with him in public . because that 's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space .
now , come , j.j. , that 's a little too harsh . anyone seems fair game for you tonight .
now do n't kid a kidder .
and i believe that 's precisely where i read it , too . you see , j.j. , where i get my reputation for being the best-informed man in washington .
yes , the justice , that 's right . but i think you had it in the column .
err ... the supreme court story , i was telling you - justice black .
i remember once when you did n't quite `` put things together '' . boy ! was the mayor mad !
yeah , i got eyes . i put things together .
say , that 's good - it 's nice - in fact , it 's apt , harry !
i do n't believe it .
say hello to sidney falco . tickle him - he 's been a bad boy tonight . he called you my fat friend .
she mighta jumped . love suicide ? check it for me , phil ... it 's a real heart throb .
yeah . at bellevue . still hanging on . but they still do n't know if she was pushed .
incidentally , what happened to that doll ? - you gave me the item last night . still alive ?
i just checked `` downtown '' . quiet everywhere tonight .
bonna sera , commendatore . come sta ?
hello , harry .
susie , there 's nothing wrong with dallas ! your brother and i arranged it all . and if the leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life , forget it ! - your brother arranged that one , too ! i do n't usually give away presents ; but this is my gift to you : get out of here ! leave this man !
you 're incapable of the truth ...
listen with care - this will cost me everything , so you know i 'm telling you the truth !
talk to her yourself ...
talk to her , sidney ...
is that why you were romancing her , you mutt ! let 's call it quits , my dear . i 'd like it fine if you found another home . that means the front door is open ! pack your things , rent a moving van and git ! and as for marriage , let me hit you with a few choice facts : you are n't ready for marriage ! you 're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men !
i was trying to build her up , not tear her down -
j.j. , i swear to you on my mother 's life , i wo n't do it . if you gave me your column i would n't do a thing like that ...
sidney , i told you -
the man in jail is always for freedom .
j.j. , it 's one thing to wear your dog collar ... but when it gets to be a noose ... i 'd rather have my freedom .
why give her real proof ? you nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right , j.j. , - but she almost followed him out the window . what do you want - a chronic invalid ?
she knows now .
why do something that would drive them right back into each other 's arms ? not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow ...
how does it matter who 's sister ? the main thing , they 're through and -
are you listening ?
sidney , i know human nature . susie lied to me - she 'll see that boy again .
but not for anything i did today ...
what are you so chipper about ? if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes , you 'd look like a graveyard !
wild ? take a look at them and see who 's wild ...
do n't go wild , sidney .
let 's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks -- - i 'll just lay it on the line ! what about that big rumpus in my office today ? you were there , frank ! where , according to st. dallas , j.j. was responsible for the elwell smear !
calculated risk . only we happen to know , j.j. , that you like me . i 'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent .
full of beans , ai n't you ? but you know that you 'll stand or fall by what you 're doing now ...
a pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match ! it 's a new wrinkle to tell the truth ... i never thought i 'd make a killing on some guy 's `` integrity '' .
what does that mean - integrity ?
integrity - acute , like indigestion .
what 's this boy got that susie likes ?
presumably yours ... that 's according to st. dallas .
and who 's feet is she on now ?
sure , he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz !
well he 's got her in a tizzy , i 'll tell you that !
no , that 's the point - he wo n't accept your favor ! the manager yes , but not the boy .
but it 's too late . i got him back the job ...
i like that , too . look , j.j. , we can wrap this up in one neat bundle , addressed to the dumps - to oblivion . we 're going great , but please play it my way . i cased this kid . know his ins and outs ... he 's fulla juice and vinegar , just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze . do little sidney a favor : squeeze ! - you know , j.j. - the porcupine bit - needles .
ca n't hurt ? i had to get him back his job .
ca n't hurt ...
i think you loused this up but good . if i can trust my eyes , and i think i can , susie knows all about your dirty work .
with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good .
i got that boy coming over here . what 's so funny ?
sure you can if you want to , and i know you 'll want to ... by the way , what 's your beef against little sidney ?
i 'm not sure i can reach him in time .
no , i wo n't ...
susie , i like this new attitude of yours . you 're growing up and i like it ! i do n't like it when you 're limp and dependent , when you 're odd and wayward . this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world . because , do n't forget , dear , you wo n't always have me with you , will you ... ?
i read your column every day ...
you 're picking up my lingo , hon .
yes . with your `` prestige '' it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of american tel and tel .
he means that much to you ... ?
get steve back his job ... please ...
how ?
j.j. , you said you want to help me - prove it !
well , what have i got ? alimony to a pair of tramps ? they 're of no concern to me . it 's you who count , but do n't get me wrong - i do n't intend to let you break your neck again !
then maybe you can tell me if he 's as solid as you say , why does he rap me every chance he gets ?
i know steve . no .
you mean they 've been fired already , on the basis of this crude smear ?
j.j. , i want you to get them back their job , steve and the quintet .
tonight . before you go to bed . the cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river .
when ?
uh huh .
what you promised - do it ! do n't finagle around . it 's later than you think .
i 'll do it , j.j. - do n't get me wrong - in for a penny , in for a pound . i 'll see it through , but stop beating me around the head . let me make a living !
ha ! my right hand has n't seen my left hand for thirty years !
correct me if i 'm wrong - we ! because when i 'm out on this very slippery limb for you , you have to know what 's involved .
not `` we '' , sidney , you !
no , lem me finish . i do n't like this job ! that boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he 's got a head . and susan , like you said , she 's growing up . two heads . what i mean , we got a slippery , dangerous problem here !
are you finished ?
awright , that brings us up to five weeks ago . `` sidney , i got a nasty little problem here . '' did i say no ? i 'm frank to admit - it do n't jell as fast as we like ... but all of a sudden i ca n't get you on the phone no more ! why ? ... and why , as of this date , am i frozen out of the column ...
i 'll listen one more minute .
correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't think so ...
i do n't ?
frankly , j.j. , i do n't think you got the cards to blitz me .
why not break it up yourself ? you could do it in two minutes flat .
i 'm a schoolboy - teach me , teach me .
you want something done , j.j. , but i doubt if you yourself know what 's involved .
you told me you 'd break up that romance - when ?
i like harry , but i ca n't deny he sweats a little .
spahish ... that must show he likes `` spigs '' , too .
the day that i ca n't get along without press agents ' handouts , i 'll close up shop , lock , stock and barrel and move to alaska .
i did n't say that , j.j .
yes , with your clients ' names attached . that 's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world ! now , as i make it out , you 're doing me a favor !
you print them , do n't you ?
what , some cheap , gruesome gags ?
you just had a good example of it . a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna .
why do n't you answer the man , sidalee ? he 's trying to take you off the hook .
not just this minute , j.j ... .
match me , sidney ...
everyone knows manny davis ... ... except mrs. manny davis .
i know manny davis .
i have a message from your sister .
mac ! i do n't want this man at my table ...
no . you 're dead , son - get yourself buried !
can i come in for a minute ?
you had something to do for me - you did n't do it .
i have to talk to you , alone , j.j. , that 's why .
can i come out ? no .
yeah ... and another thing - he 's gon na say you 'resisted arrest ' ... you know j.j ... . !
i thought he would .
go out with different girls !
well , i 'll be darned . and what does j.j. think he should do ?
he goes out with girls .
is that a fact ? he 's a dilly , ai n't he ? by the by , what did he have against this boy ?
... and he 's got them on him . i appreciate a thing like that - i appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city .
- he 's got them on him .
it 's nice , sidney , that you give me this tip ...
he 's leaving early . after this `` set '' . he 'll be out in a couple of minutes ...
what 's all the rush ? you said three o'clock .
i call him the boy with the ice cream face !
i know ... i know you 're the strongest cop in town .
let 's wait till christmas - it 's more legitimate then .
what 's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates ?
no . it 's one of j.j. 's occasional beau gestes . evidently the fellow 's funny , so he gave him a plug .
who put this item in about the comic ? `` if there 's a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace , you 'll have to pardon us for not catching the name . we were too busy screaming . '' does this temple have a press agent ?
and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart ?
bribing me again ?
dallas ? could be . he does n't look like a reefer smoker ...
could this be that boy ?
something about a frank d'angelo trying to reach you ...
what about ?
that 's a question i usually like to ask you . your secretary phoned .
- that 's what i mean !
nothing i did n't think of you before .
what would you think of me if -
next time i 'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling !
a girl needs a little romancing before she -
listen , you need him for a favor , do n't you ! and so do i ! i need his column -- tonight . did n't you ask me to do something about your job ? do n't you have a kid in military school ?
this sort of thing !
what sort of thing ?
sidney ... i ... i do n't do this sort of thing ...
i beg your pardon ! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i 'm a heavy . here 's your shoe , there 's your coat , that 's the door !
do n't you think i have any feelings ? what am i ? a bowl of fruit ? a tangerine that peels in a minute ?
what kind of an act is this ?
what do you want all of a sudden - lady godiva ... ? where 's my other shoe ?
so take five minutes ! get acquainted ! he 's an important man - he 's lonely - do n't be dumb !
and he 's a perfect stranger to me .
yeah !
yeah . otis elwell . the columnist .
do n't you know who that man is ?
one of those business meetings , honey - always coming up in the middle of the night .
back ?
hello .
rita , say hello to otis elwell .
can you be there by two-thirty ?
do you still keep your key under the mat ?
that 's what i 'm thinking , rita . maybe ...
do you think you could do something , sidney ?
but , sidney darling , the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning !
we 're old friends , chickie - quit it ! a big columnist comes in this room , without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter ! what did you think would happen in his house ?
i do n't know - it 's a big apartment . but i was n't interviewed . in fact , i was totally unprepared for what happened .
and where was his wife ?
in his apartment -
you were thrilled to be interviewed . were you `` interviewed '' ?
... cigarette girls ... and naturally -
he was writing a special sunday piece on ... ?
staring . consequently , when he approached me on his way out i was n't surprised , but i did n't let on .
avidly . he was staring .
no . that 's what i mean - i 'm being fired for what i did n't do .
do n't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha ?
at the bar - sidney ...
is frank d'angelo around ?
sidney , can i talk to you a minute ?
you 're sure . find out for me .
i do n't think so .
i 've been up to here . listen , honey , tell me something . you know susan hunsecker ... ? has she been in ? i mean lately , in the last coupla days ... ?
do n't you ever get messages , eyelashes ? i called you twice .
if you want me to -
stay down town tonight . maybe we 'll take in a show , etc .
or what you see in me , for that matter ...
that 's no way to talk ...
i swear , sidney , i ca n't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you ...
do n't judge a situation where you do n't know what 's involved ...
i know you do , sidney .
i put a lotta trust in you , chickie ...
yes .
did you send my folks in philly the check ... ?
nothing ...
what 's the matter ?
and leave a tip in every hat-check room in town ?
take a top coat .
if that 's for me , tear it up !
no . you think i 'm a hero . i 'm no hero . i 'm nice to people where it pays me to be . i got ta do it too much on the outside , so do n't expect me to kow-tow in my own office . i 'm in a bind right now with hunsecker so -- every dog has his day ! lock up and leave the key .
i 'm used to you ...
you ought to be used to me by now .
sid ... you got me so ... i do n't know what ...
so what 'll you do if i feel nervous ? you 'll open your meaty , sympathetic arms ... ?
sidney , please , dear , if you feel nervous ...
you mean you do n't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world ? ? ?
sidney , i know you by now . do n't do a dance with me ...
yes , but as a new subscriber you 're under no obligation to take more than three books . and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
i hate to see you like this --
go home , sally . it 's late ...
help me with two minutes of silence !
i wish i could help in some way , sidney .
it wo n't leave much of a balance in the bank ... mr. robard ? could you locate him ?
pay the rent . let the tailor wait .
the renting agent and the tailor .
who else phoned ?
may i rent you out as an adding machine .
that makes five days in a row that mr. hunsecker 's cut you out of his column .
but what ?
but ...
it is n't . i 've just seen the early edition .
no , an arm , he said . i told him you were sure the item would be in mr. hunsecker 's column in tomorrow 's ...
he wants me to break a leg ?
that 's the third time he 's called today .
why do n't we hear what susie has to say ?
give him credit -- -the boy 's gall is gorgeous !
do n't you think it 's about time you shut yours ? who are you to tell a man like frank d'angelo to shut up ? !
frank , you do n't listen ! j.j. just told you to shut your mouth !
well , i 'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing , will ya ? how do you like it ? he comes to my office and -
you 're talking very fast .
according to you , yeah . dallas , your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty ! i do n't like you , comma , but neither do i go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds . also , since we 're talking repulsive , j.j. wo n't like this for two cents ! do n't give me that look , dallas - j.j. believes in fair play . and secondly , this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend !
it is a favor , is n't it ?
dallas , ask your own manager - he 's standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife . so how do you get him doing j.j. a favor ?
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both .
that 's your idea of logic ? i tell the judge i did n't murder the man - the judge says , `` why not you ? ''
why not you ?
why me ... ?
frank thinks i should n't have come here -
it 's a habit with me . so now i 'm briefed . so what ?
begging your pardon , i have n't been down the bowery in years !
i 'm feeling too good to fight with you , but that is n't what i said - i said you snoop . for instance , what were you doing around my hotel the other night ?
well , thanks , anyway - let 's forget it . it 's cold out here , susie .
where 's those glossy prints you promised ? tonight 's the latest i can place them -
you tell him , i stutter !
and it would cost a pretty penny , huh ?
see me in my office .
speak to this lad , al , ... to mr. falco .
if there 's a funnier man in the world than herbie temple at the palace ... uh ... pardon us for not catching the name , we were too busy laughing . no , make that 'screaming ' . it 's sweet of you , j.j. , thanks . probably see you at twenty one tonight . no , for supper , late . right . 'bye ...
good ! we 're all off to utica , so excuse me , mr. frannis-on-the- portisan .
no , i do n't mind . i 'm busy too .
cheers . what time is it , al ?
- and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were .
did you now ? on which bounce ?
temple , i caught your act the other night and -
you watch him , al , i s ... s ... stutter !
do n't explain , sidney ... it does n't matter now ...
j.j. , if you think -
please , sidney , i ca n't stand this -
do n't run away - i was always the man for you ! i 'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what i say ! inside of six months -
... but you did it for greed , sidney - and that 's pathetic .
i did n't do anything !
i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love ...
i know that bit - you 're a girl ; you need a man to give you strength ! so what do you pick such weak sisters for ? do n't you know yet that you fight fire with fire , not with tear drops ?
i 'm not a man , sidney , i 'm -
yeah ! like me ! i do n't choke on my own gall - i fight back ! let them choke , not me !
like you ?
susie , whatever problems you have with j.j. - i did n't invent them ! what 're you blaming me for ? if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off !
what ship ?
and i 'm sorry for you , too , sidney . you 're going down with the ship .
come on now , chickie , why do n't you go to bed ... ?
i 'm sorry about steve , not myself . i 'm even sorry for my brother . to be so lonely , without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she 's his only real family -
listen , get a good night 's sleep - tomorrow 's another day . feeling sorry for yourself wo n't help .
but i do n't need an uncle , sidney .
it 's not my nature , susie , but i 'll talk to you like an uncle ...
why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !
i hope that j.j. really likes steve , that it is n't an act .
chickie , i 'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you ... !
it 's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself , not just because i 'm my brother 's sister .
frankly , yes , to my surprise . he thinks he 's very gifted - those boys 'll go a big mile , he thinks .
do you think j.j. likes steve ... ?
who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops , like a trained poodle ?
where do you come off to make a remark like that ?
well , for one thing , he thinks j.j. is some kind of monster .
yes , but why ?
we stick in each others craw .
not to me . sometimes , the world feels like a cage . then someone comes along and opens the door ... and it 's never monday night again ... i wish you and steve could like each other .
feels like a monday night , do n't it ... ?
i was n't looking for a brawl . i came to bring him a present . wan na bite to eat ?
you 're touchy , sidney - do n't be so touchy ...
if you 're funny , james , i 'm a pretzel ! drop dead !
he 's intuitive - he knows he 's getting fired !
no more you do n't ! what is this - you 're showing off for her ? they 're supposed to hear you in korea ?
that was two months ago . take your hand out of my pocket , thief !
listen , when your band was playing at roseland -
joan , call a cop ! we 'll arrest this kid for larceny !
jimmy , i 'm on my way inside right now to talk to hunsecker . i can promise you -
what do you do for that hundred a week . fall out of bed ?
i tried to reach you twice -
yeah . a coincidence you should run into the very man you 've been ducking all week ! this is my press agent , joan .
jimmy ! this is a coincidence . i am just going -
you are saying goodbye , are n't you ... ?
not what you 're doing now . at least do n't ask me - do n't ask him . you 're fighting for your life ! what do you want to do ?
steve , i feel exhausted ... what do you want me to do ?
i told your brother i could n't be his accomplice . i ca n't be yours either , susie , and encourage him to go on pulverizing you . i know what type - he 's my old man all over again !
but , please , steve , please - one step at a time ! i was born only yesterday ! ...
no ! i 'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother !
but i do n't care about that now . he knew what he was doing today . he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage - if i would bend to every whim of his , like sidney ! i could n't do that , susie ...
steve , i ...
susie , i was there for our sake , too . but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa ! by the way , i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears ...
i just did n't think that i could antagonize him , steve -- for our sake , i mean .
but you did n't do much about it , susie . you walked out , and there i was ... solo ... and not too good at that .
no one 's ever stood up to my brother the way you did .
well , maybe i was wrong , too ... but there 's no doubt , susie , that we have to face some serious things ...
steve ... what you tried to do today ... you tried to take me up on a high mountain ... i could n't go all the way ... i failed you ... will you forgive me ? have i lost you , steve ? have i ... ?
would you buy me a cup of coffee ? in there ...
why did you call me ?
hello , steve . i 'm glad you could come .
steve , stop it please ...
i get the feeling , falco , that you 're always snooping around ...
no , you had me eating that chinese food ! ...
i made you write a beautiful song ...
and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer . steve how do you think i realized i love you ?
and on monday , i 'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
if the stores are open -
i have a message for you ; i love you . may i dedicate the next number to you ? ... and the next , and the next . every sunday i 'll buy you a new bonnet -
steve , dear , please forget all of this . what can it matter after tomorrow ?
but he could be reporting back to your brother , could n't he ?
darling , i do n't care - really i do n't . sidney 'd had a secret crush on me for years , but nothing we do is his business -
his stooge , falco , is around - i saw him walk in . he 's been spying on me for weeks , susie .
but he is n't going to like this , susie . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i would n't give him a second thought if not for you .
steve , my brother is n't as bad as he 's painted . he is n't perfect , but -
i 'm telling him in the morning after breakfast .
you have n't told him yet ...
steve , i 'd rather you did n't say anything for a day or two ... until i tell my brother ...
this is big , you know . very big ! let 's go out later , drink some firewater . with the boys . fred can call millie and -
that 's right ! there 's no way i 'm going to finish the new processor now . forget it . i 'm out of it . i 'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow ... i 'll sell real estate , i do n't care , , ,
but i thought ... are n't we changing things ? i mean ... right now ? changing the way it goes ?
why did you marry me , miles ? why did we have these two children ? you do n't need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it does n't love you like we do .
imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake , never gets tired , never shows up to work with a hangover . meet the pilot .
i 'm sorry , honey , it 's just that i 'm thiiis close .
i know . you told me . it 's a neural-net processor . it thinks and learns like we do . it 's superconducting at room temperature . other computer are pocket calculators by comparison . but why is that so goddamn important , miles ? i really need to know , 'cause i feel like i 'm going crazy here , sometimes .
baby , this thing is going to blow 'em all away . it 's a neural-net process --
oh . i ca n't , honey . i 'm on a roll here .
miles , it 's sunday . you promised to take the kids to raging waters today .
i ca n't
you need a break . you 'll see it clear when you come back .
... but the output went to shit after three seconds . i 'm thinking now it 's the way i 'm matrixing the command hierarchies ...
i 'm sorry , baby . this thing is just kicking my ass . i thought we had it with this one ...
you going to work all day ?
no ! ! we 're going all the way ! you got that , dyson ?
we should abort .
i was scary stuff , radically advanced . it was shattered ... did n't work . but it gave us ideas , it took us in new directions ... things we would never have thought of . all this work is based on it .
those lying motherfuckers !
they told us not to ask where they got it . i thought ... japan ... hell , i do n't know . i did n't want to know .
they have it in a vault at cyberdyne ... it 's got ta be from the other one like you .
what chip ?
do you know about the chip ?
shut up ! shut up ! ! motherfucker ! it 's all your fault ! it 's your fault ! !
please ... let ... the kids ... go ...
let me try mine .
no good .
alright , yeah . you 're right . we have to destroy the stuff at the lab , the files , disk drive ... and everything i have here . everything ! i do n't care .
no one must follow your work .
look , whatever you want me to do , i 'll do . i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up , okay ?
now listen to me very carefully .
my god .
in the bathroom . danny , can you get them for us ?
do you have bandages ?
i order you not to !
it must end here ... or i am the future .
do n't do it . please ... do n't go --
i have to go away , john .
no , no no ! ! it 'll be okay . stay with us !
i 'm sorry , john .
no !
yes . throw it in .
will it melt in there ?
terminated .
is it dead ?
what ?
we do n't have much time .
where you going ? !
drive for a minute .
trust me .
remember what i said , you ca n't ...
i 'll deal with the police .
i do n't care ! ! there 's got ta be another way . have n't you learned anything ? ! have n't you figured out why you ca n't kill people ?
killing dyson might actually prevent the war .
i do n't care . we 've got ta stop her .
the t-1000 has the same files that i do . it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson 's house .
drive faster .
this is tactically dangerous .
yeah , got ta be ! miles dyson ! she 's gon na blow him away !
dyson .
i guess , yeah -- oh shit ! !
she intends to change the future somehow .
`` no fate . '' no fate but what we make . my father told her this ... i mean i made him memorize it , up in the future , as a message to her -- never mind . okay , the whole thing goes `` the future is not set . there is no fate but what we make for ourselves . ''
no problemo .
alriight ! ! my man !
no .
uh-unh , no , it 's different ... it 's when there 's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway . you get it ?
pain causes it ?
you mean people ? i do n't know . we just cry . you know . when it hurts .
why do you cry ?
yeah . i guess so . my mom says when i 'm , like , 45 , i think , i send him back through time to 1984. but right now he has n't even been born yet . man , is messes with your head . where 's that other bolt ? thanks . mom and him were only together for one night , but she still loves him , i guess . i see her crying sometimes . she denies it totally , of course . like she says she got something in her eye .
you will .
here . i wish i coulda met my real dad .
torque wrench please .
no . i have to stay functional until my mission is complete . then it does n't matter .
you do n't feel any emotion about it one way or the other ?
no .
not even of dying ?
yeah , i thought you 'd like this place .
excellent .
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves .
we 're not gon na make it , are we ? people , i mean .
yeah . smile . you know . people smile , right ? watch .
smile ?
and that 's another thing . you could lighten up a bit , yourself . this severe routine is getting old . smile once in a while .
no problemo .
that 's great ! see , you 're getting it .
chill out , dickwad .
yeah , or `` later , dickwad . '' or if someone gets upset you say `` chill out . '' like that . or you can do combinations .
`` hasta la vista , baby '' ?
it someone comes off to you with an attitude , you say `` eat me '' ... if you wan na shine them on , it 's `` hasta la vista , baby '' .
no , no , no . you got ta listen to the way people talk . see , you do n't say like `` affirmative '' or some shit like that . you say ... no problemo .
affirmative .
a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell .
how long do you live ? i mean , last ?
i sense injuries . the data could be called pain .
does it hurt ?
cool .
everything .
just say `` i swear i wo n't kill anyone . ''
what ?
swear .
right .
now remember , you 're not gon na kill anyone , right ?
you just ca n't , okay ? trust me on this .
why ?
whattaya mean , why ? 'cause you ca n't !
why ?
listen to me , very carefully , okay ? you 're not a terminator any more . alright ? you got that ? you ca n't just go around killing people !
of course . i 'm a terminator .
jesus ... you were gon na kill that guy !
prove it ... stand on one foot .
that is one of my mission parameters .
you have to do what i say ? !
you told me to .
oww ! why 'd you do that ?
yeah , well fuck you , she 's a priority to me !
negative . she is not a mission priority .
terminated ! ? shit ! why did n't you tell me ? we got ta right now !
typically , the subject being copied is terminated .
oh , great . and what happens to her ?
negative . the t-1000 's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her .
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua ... places like that . for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy , running guns . then there were some other guys . she 'd shack up with anybody she could learn from . so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader . then she gets busted and it 's like ... sorry kid , your mom 's a psycho . did n't you know ? it 's like ... everything i 'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy , right ? i hated her for that . but everything she said was true . we got ta get her out of there .
it ca n't form complex machines . guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts . it does n't work that way . but it can form solid metal shapes .
well , why does n't become a bomb or something to get me ?
no . only an object of equal size .
like it could disguise itself as anything ... a pack of cigarettes ?
anything it samples by physical contact .
i need a minute here , okay ? you 're telling me it can imitate anything it touches ?
max .
i 'm right here . i 'm fine . what 's the dog 's name ?
i would .
you sure ?
negative . the t-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there .
can i stop by my house ?
we have to leave the city , immediately . and avoid the authorities .
where we going ?
you are targeted for termination . the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission . ever .
radical .
liquid metal .
what does that mean ?
not like me . a t-1000 . advanced prototype . a mimetic polyalloy .
so this other guy ? he 's a terminator too , right , like you ?
you did . thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here , in this time .
yeah ? who sent you ?
my mission is to protect you .
this in intense . get a grip , john . okay , uh ... you 're not here to kill me ... i figured that part out for myself . so what 's the deal ?
i 'm a cybernetic organism . living tissue over a metal endoskeleton .
holy shit ... you 're really real ! i mean ... whoah ! you 're , uh ... like a machine underneath , right ... but sort of alive outside ?
no way !
yes . cyberdyne systems , model 101 .
now do n't take this the wrong way , but you are a terminator , right ?
yeah , she 's a total loser . c'mon , let 's check out the 7-eleven , whatya say ?
no shit ?
actually , no , she 's a complete psycho . that 's why she 's up at pescedero . she tries to blow up a computer factory , but she got shot and arrested .
so she 's pretty cool , huh ?
where 'd you learn all this stuff ?
easy money !
gim me that phillips right there .
your foster parents are kinda dicks , right ?
shoot ! ! ! !
john , get out of the way ! !
ready .
ready to rock ?
go ! i 'll finish here .
i got it . piece of cake .
mom , mom , we need to be more constructive here . i do n't see this as a gender-related issue . she 's still tense . we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening . right ?
yeah . right . how were you supposed to know ? fucking men ... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your ... fucking ideas and your weapons . did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man ? colt , browning , smith , thompson , kalashnikov ... all men . men built the hydrogen bomb , not women ... men like you thought it up . you 're so creative . you do n't know what it 's like to really create something ... to create a life . to feel it growing inside you . all you know how to create is death ... you fucking bastards .
i know , mom . i know .
i love you , john . i always have .
it 's okay . it 'll by okay . we 'll figure it out .
uh huh .
i could n't ... oh , god . you ... came here ... to stop me ?
mom ? you okay ?
i need to know how skynet get built . who 's responsible ?
yeah . drag , huh ?
look , mom , if i 'm supposed to ever be this great leader , you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while . 'cause if you wo n't , nobody else will .
i do n't trust it ! these things are hard to kill , john , believe me , i know . we may never have this opportunity again .
but it 's the only proof we have to the future ... about the war and all that .
we 're better off by ourselves .
alright , it ! we need it !
it , john . not him . it .
no ! do n't kill him !
out of the way , john !
there 's not much time left in the world , sarah .
kyle , do n't go !
remember the message ... the future is not set . there is not fate but what we make for ourselves .
i know , but i 'm not as strong as i 'm supposed to be . i ca n't do it . i 'm screwing up the mission .
do n't quit , sarah . our son need you .
i know !
it 's john who 's the target now . you have to protect him . he 's wide open .
they took him from me .
oh , god ... kyle . i need you so much .
i love you . i always will .
oh . yeah . they ... make me take this stuff ...
i know . this is a dream , sarah .
open the goddamn door !
you 're already dead , silberman . everybody here dies . you know i believe that . so do n't fuck with me !
there 's 215 bones in the human body , motherfucker . that 's one . now do n't move !
you broke my arm !
you see , sarah ... here 's the problem . i know how smart you are , and i think you 're just telling me what i want to hear . i do n't think you really believe who you 've been telling me today .
so what do you think , doctor ? i 've shown a lot of improvement , have n't i ?
i see . so you do n't believe anymore that the company covered it up ?
if i had , there would have been some evidence . they would have found something at the factory .
but you 've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press .
i see . let 's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines . now you think they do n't exist ?
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months . well , it 's been six months , and i was looking forward to seeing my son .
and what it that ?
it has helped me a lot to have a goal , something to look forward to .
yes .
are you afraid ?
no . there is another chip .
it 's finally over .
take your kids . go to a hotel . right now . do n't pack . let 's go .
is it safe for them here ?
can you get us in there , past security ?
i must be destroyed .
son of a bitch , i knew it !
the cpu from the first terminator .
i want to know everything . what he looks like . where he lives . everything .
i have detailed files .
jesus . how much do you know about dyson ?
because skynet knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here .
why attack russia ?
yes . it launches its icbms against their targets in russia .
and skynet fights back .
basically . the skynet funding bill is passed . the system goes on-line august 4th , 1997. human decisions are removed from strategic defense . skynet begins to learn , at a geometric rate . it becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time , august 29. in a panic , they try to pull the plug .
uh huh , great . then those fat fucks in washington figure , what the hell , let a computer run the whole show , right ?
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems . all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers , becoming fully unmanned , afterward , the fly with a perfect operational record .
then what ?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor .
why him ?
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson , director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation .
no .
does n't want you thinking too much , huh ?
my cpu is a neural-net processor ... a learning computer . but skynet presets the switch to `` read-only '' when we are sent out alone .
correct .
i 'll bet . makes you a more efficient killer , right ?
so do you .
you look like handmade shit .
unknown .
can it be destroyed ?
ballistic penetration shocks it , but only for a few seconds .
this t-1000 ... what happens when you shoot it ?
you think you 're alive and safe , but you 're already dead . everybody , you , him ... everybody ... you 're all fucking dead !
relax now , sarah --
on august 29th 1997 it 's going to feel pretty fucking real to you , too ! anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gon na have a real bad day , get it ?
i 'm sure it feels very real to you --
it 's not just a dream . it 's real , you moron ! i know the date is happens ! !
please continue ...
... it 's ... like a giant strobe light , burning right through my eyes ... but somehow i can still see . look , you know the dream 's the same every night , why do i have to --
our duty is to help furtwngler with his defence , that 's why i want you to look at this ... these are part of the transcripts of the trial at nuremberg . we ca n't get them translated fast enough . but i guess you understand german , right ?
major arnold believes he has a moral duty , too .
you represent the united states now . we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just .
i do n't know .
on furtwngler .
on all what ?
where do you stand on all this ?
and this , only one of these letters , major . i have lots of them .
'please remember that dr. furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him . i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help . he never turned anyone away . after he heard me play ... i am a violinist ... he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden . he helped countless people in similar ways . '
i do n't know . but you and i already know that he has saved lives .
when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him , was he pleased ?
when he made his decision , he could n't have known everything . especially not the way people like you do , who 've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . because you are blameless , you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . but you have no idea how people lived here .
yesterday i read that furtwngler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in '36 , toscanini suggested it . had he accepted , he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america .
but i promised your mother .
do n't see me to my door , there 's no need .
i do n't know .
what does he mean , too correct ?
right . so , this is going to be very formal , too , now . lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares .
and talking is talking ! well , i think we better get on .
eating is eating ... and ...
and no elbows on the table !
respect your elders and your betters !
oh ! and do n't wave your hands about !
that 's right . i was raised very strictly . so do n't speak before you are spoken to !
that 's because you had a proper upbringing .
what is it with you , david ? where are your feelings ? where 's your hatred , your disgust ? where 's your fucking outrage , david ?
major , show me someone who has n't made an anti-semitic remark and i 'll show you the gates of paradise .
a human being , oh , good , i 'm relieved , i thought you were going to say you were a music lover . this man , this great artist has made anti-semitic remarks like you would n't believe . i got letters .
yes , i 'm a jew . but i like to think first i 'm a human being .
david , i do n't understand a thing about you . you 're a jew . are you a jew ?
major , he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect .
with more what ? more what ?
when you question him again , could you treat him with more respect ?
yeah .
can i ask you a favour , major ?
my manner ? why do n't you go downstairs , get a cup of coffee and calm down ? what 's the matter , emmi ? what 's going on with you ? what 's wrong ?
your manner .
what ?
but it still does n't make them saints . they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night , do n't they ? they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me . well , just like me . ca n't they ?
major , that 's not a good argument . if dr. furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these ... these privileges , he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is . that 's true of any leading artist in any country in the world .
not so , counsellor . that secretary of yours , she was n't just your secretary , she procured women for you , did n't she ? as many and as often as you wanted .
and totally irrelevant .
you bet .
major , this is deeply offensive and repugnant !
is n't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor 's baton , is n't that true ?
david , what are you counsel for the defence now ? did you hear the question ?
major , i do n't see how this line of questioning could ...
you see , wilhelm , i 'm talking about ordinary , everyday reasons . which is why i want to discuss your private life . how many illegitimate children do you have ?
why not show dr. furtwngler the evidence . it may refresh his memory ?
yes , david ?
yes . what was the orchestra 's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler 's birthday ?
you have a question for helmuth , david ?
it 's a bet . you 're the witness , emmi .
five minutes .
okay , better question the next witness . i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes .
that 's big of him .
major richards said he 'd call to let us know .
jeez . and you think the british 'll share it with their allies ?
i do n't know , but the british are excited about it , i know that . the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich .
what 's that mean ?
the british occupy the building where this guy , hinkel , ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems they 've ... they 've discovered his secret archive .
so what is it ?
yes .
david , need to ask you something . you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive ?
they 're trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories . who really owns what ? that 's colonel dymshitz , on the far side .
what the hell are they doing ?
'dim-shits ' ?
colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you .
so , what does the russki want ?
i guess it 's possible .
you think a whole orchestra , what , a hundred and forty or so guys , could be orchestrated ?
do n't . this is like a criminal investigation , david . musicians , morticians , doctors , lawyers , butchers , clerks . they 're all the same .
some .
i guess you admire musicians .
was born here , in leipzig . i escaped in '36 . my parents , they sent me to my uncle in philadelphia . they were to follow . but they delayed and ...
where you from , david ?
you call me sir again and i 'll make you listen to beethoven .
i guess so , sir .
sounds a lot of run . so they sent the big guns to check up on me . we recruiting children now ?
david . david wills . i 'm your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee . sir .
i 'm steve . what 's your name ?
i 'm very sorry .
for chrissakes i hate that shit , cut it out .
lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold . sir .
then you 're going to kill me .
i 'm gon na get that fucking bandleader , colonel . no deal . no fucking deal .
duty ? i am sorry , duty ? duty fucking duty . trouble is , you americans want everybody to live like you . we liberated berlin , major steve , not you . our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture .
i have a duty .
let furtwngler go . please .
no can do .
i 'm sorry . museum ? not ... i said orchestra . sorry . believe me . help me , steve . you say you answer for someone from high up . i , too , have orders from high up . very high up . we want furtwngler . i 'll give you in return the whole orchestra , four , five conductors . i need him , steve .
what museum ?
and suddenly , steve , suddenly you notice that they like you . they honour you , suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world , for example .
there are good party members who help , and there are dirty non-party members who inform on you . of course , they gave him privileges .
this is what i 'm saying . he must have had party contacts .
in a dictatorship , art belongs to the party . if you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .
yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , i heard all about that .
do n't talk about things you know nothing about . he was in a dictatorship !
but what ... before that turns rotten ... what if they surround the space with barbed wire , colonel ?
anyway , major , why should he leave his country , his mother tongue , his family , his history , his past , his future , just because now , suddenly , there is a dictatorship ? why ?
colonel . he had no sisters , no brothers , only a lot of love affairs .
that 's why he did n't get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he could n't answer . why did n't he go and direct in america , like that italian , toscanini .
a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone .
we 're dealing with degenerates here .
furtwngler 's in a different category .
i was in vienna . i had with me an austrian chauffeur , max his name was , he spent time in the camps . we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage , scavenging for rotting food , butt ends , anything . i said , 'to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city , a million of 'em , and now look at 'em . ' and max said , 'oh , not these people , major . these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics . ' you get the point , colonel ? the point is they 're all full of shit .
i 've had two meetings with him . he 's a great musician . maybe the greatest conductor in the world . his brahms , beethoven , schubert - unequalled .
not yet .
so , major , tell me , have you questioned dr. furtwngler ?
colonel . pleasure .
hello , major , my name is dymshitz . i 'm glad to see you .
i would like to go now , please .
if he had no idea , why did the jews need saving ? this is the question , emmi , to all germans : why did the jews need saving in this country ? why , if people had no idea ?
but he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested .
emmi , stop ! i want to show you something . let me show you something and then if you want to leave , you can leave , please please . his friends , they did this . and he gave them birthday concerts .
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that . just like you questioned him .
what 's not right ?
i ca n't do this . it 's not right .
what is this , emmi ?
i 'm sorry but i have to leave . i 'll find other work . you 'll have to get someone else , that 's all .
put it on ready to play , and i 'll tell you when to play it .
of course .
do you know where the adagio begins ?
bruckner 's seventh , major .
shut the door , emmi . sit down , emmi . we 're going to keep him waiting , too .
major , major ... he 's here ...
come in , emmi , this is your office , too . emmi , this is lieutenant david wills .
i 'm sorry .
you tell him nothing , emmi . if he calls again , you say you know nothing . we 're gon na keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses . and , god help me , with beethoven .
the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires . major , what am i to tell dr. furtwngler ?
what 's in those files ?
no . ours was damaged .
i 'm kidding , emmi . what about a record player ? you have that , too ?
but ... he only wrote nine , major .
mine 's the eleventh .
oh yes , major , i have recordings of all his symphonies . i kept them safe during the bombing . my favourite is the seventh symphony .
think you can get me any of that ?
there have been messages for you . a lieutenant david wills called from the allied kommandatura cultural affairs office in wiesbaden . i do n't know who he is .
steve .
and your father was executed .
yes . she suffered longer . she was in ravensbruck .
your mother , too .
my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler . they arrested the plotters and their families .
says here because of your father . what 's that mean ?
three months .
okay , let 's see . how long were you in the camp for ?
yes .
you do shorthand and typing ?
yes .
you live here , in berlin ?
look around you . see the country you served . look at people who had real courage , who took risks , who risked their lives . like emmi 's father .
i love my country , i believe in music , what was i to do ?
have you ever smelled burning flesh ? i smelt it four miles away . four miles away , i smelt it . have you ever seen the gas chambers , the crematoria ? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses ? you talk to me about culture , art and music ? you putting that in the scales , wilhelm ? you setting culture , art and music against the millions put to death by your pals ? they had orchestras in the camps . they played beethoven , wagner . the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families . i do n't understand the germans ' relationship with music . what do you need music for ? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated ? yes , i blame you for not getting hanged , i blame you for your cowardice . you strutted and swaggered , you fucking piece of shit , king-pin in a shithouse . you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows , and i say to you , lies !
i 'll tell you , then . the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself . listen to it . they listen . did they pick little k 's recording ? did they pick some other conductor ? no , they picked you , and why ? because you represented them so beautifully . when the devil died , they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march . you were everything to them .
how can i know such a thing ?
who 's conducting ?
bruckner 's seventh . the adagio .
okay , so what is it ?
of course i know what that is .
do you know what that is ?
speaking to party members i used their language , of course i did , everyone did .
i believe that . but just answer the question , do n't give me explanations .
those attitudes do not exist in me .
everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews . but -- i have things here you said and wrote . listen to this : 'the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international . ' and what about this : 'jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music . ' 'jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples , lacking roots . ' you deny you said these things ?
no , that 's your problem , wilhelm . you understand nothing . we 'll call you . go !
i do n't understand what you mean .
okay , wilhelm , go home now . go home and think about these past twelve years .
but you see what i 'm getting at ? you get a gorgeous house , you 're highly paid . what are you gon na do , stay or leave ? one voice comes back at me : stay !
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter .
no , i 'm not going to stop it . hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter .
stop this , please , stop this now !
you like the women , do n't you , wilhelm ?
i said i have illegitimate children . i do n't know how many .
what ?
i have illegitimate children .
of course there was a conspiracy against me , a campaign - even abroad .
well , i 'm just beginning to develop my theme . is n't that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? okay , so they played on your insecurity . that 's human , understandable . but , there is one guy who does n't like little k as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , adolf . he thinks you 're the greatest , and when he says , i want wilhelm for my birthday , boy , they better go out get wilhelm . so , josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna , i 'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin . that 's the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . hard . why did you stay ? why did you play for them ? why were you the flag-carrier for their regime ? jealousy ?
this is absolute nonsense !
come on , admit it . k worried you , did n't he ? he always worried you . in 1942 , he 's thirty-four years old , you 're already fifty-six . and goebbels and goering keep saying to you , 'if you do n't do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i do n't care how great you are . it 's the oldest story in the book , the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck . the real reason you did n't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you 'd be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party 's boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
yes , that 's what happened .
i 'll tell you why . you remember we talked about you playing for hitler 's birthday ? and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first , that you were tricked ?
please stop playing these games with me . why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding .
now , that young conductor what 's his name ? that miracle kid , you know who i mean . von karajan ! but you called him something else . c'mon . what did you call von karajan ?
i 'm sorry .
you 've really no idea ? i 'll tell you what happened . he died in stalingrad .
i have no idea .
and what happened to von der nul ?
he said , 'do n't mind him . his job is to criticise , your job is to conduct . '
and what did he say ?
well . once he said he 'd read what this man wrote about me .
you sure you did n't call one of your close buddies and say , god in heaven , did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me ? the greatest conductor on earth . i want him out the way . he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music . send him to stalingrad . is n't that what you did ? you do n't like criticism , do you , wilhelm ? you surely did n't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you ... are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels ?
that 's an outrageous lie !
is n't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , von karajan , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no one 's heard from him since ?
yes , i know who he is .
how long 's this going to go on , wilhelm ? i say von der null , you say von der null , i say von der null , you say von der null , we could go on all day . you know who von der null is , do n't you ? edwin von der nuell , music critic .
von der null ?
yes , von der null .
von der null ?
tell me about von der null .
no , because i had only one intention . my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics .
no !
have no idea what ordinary people thought .
you know something ? you should 've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic 's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?
we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor .
art and politics , yeah , art and politics . let 's look at that . you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich , played in countries the nazis had conquered . are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on was n't a commercial for adolf and all he stood for ?
then you are wrong .
well , i tried , you got to admit i tried . i thought i might just trap you there , wilhelm , but david here was too quick for me . smart move , david , smart move . no , i do n't have the telegram , but i know it exists . and i want you to know , wilhelm , we 're going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it .
you wo n't find it because no such telegram exists .
i do n't have to think carefully . this is utterly ridiculous .
think carefully , wilhelm ... maybe not in your own name , but as privy councillor or vice-president .
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings .
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal , adolf hider .
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
'happy birthday , dear adolf , love wilhelm . ' or words to that effect . that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying , 'okay , adolf , you win . you 're the number one man . have a swell party . '
what telegram ?
and when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ?
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they were n't kept separate i learned to my cost .
gee , that 's a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i 'm going to try to remember that . liberty , humanity and justice . beautiful . but you used the word 'naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics ca n't be separated ?
maintain liberty , humanity and justice .
and what was that ?
when i last saw you , i was unprepared . i did not know what to expect . in these past weeks , i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . you have to understand who i am and what i am . i am a musician and i believe in music . i am an artist and i believe in art . art in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man 's spiritual needs . i must confess , however , to being extremely naive . i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . my entire life was devoted to music because , and this is very important , because i thought that i could , through music , do something practical .
go ahead , be my guest .
i wish to say something .
if it 's too hot , open your tie .
do n't talk to me like i was a second violinist . go back into the waiting room . miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you .
it is now nine o'clock precisely . i do not intend to be kept waiting again .
oh boy , you 're gon na love this . take your time with this now . those files contain the details of every working artist in this country . those files are gon na tell us who joined the party , who informed and who was helpful .
he told me to be careful as one of goebbels ' men was watching me . he read a report on me - everything i said was quoted word by word .
what did goering say ?
goering . because hinkel was working for goebbels .
who warned you ?
i was warned .
how ?
i was n't told . i just knew it .
who ?
certainly not , but i knew he had informers everywhere . even in my orchestra there was someone
yup , that 's him , that 's the guy . you know what else the little creep did ? he kept files , close on 250,000 files . and you know what 's in those files ?
yes , a despicable human being . he was in the ministry of culture . his job was to get rid of jews in the arts .
i 've got to hand it to the british , david . you know what those guys are ? decent . tell me , herr dr. furtwngler , do you know hans hinkel ?
i 've had enough of this , i 'm leaving .
steve arnold ...
see , david ? he ca n't answer the question . i 'll ask it again , wilhelm , and do n't give me any more airy-fairy , intellectual bullshit !
they were jews , they had to leave . they were right to leave . i could not leave my country in her deepest misery . after all , i am a german . i ... i stayed in my homeland . is that my sin in your eyes ?
i have a list of names here , people in your profession , who got out in '33 . bruno walter , otto klemperer , arnold schoenberg , max reinhardt ...
if you are going to bully me like this , major , you had better do your homework . you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are .
you were real close to all of them , to adolf , to hermann , to joseph , to baldur , and now albert , so , let 's hear the truth , let 's come clean . what was your party number ?
it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .
you sure knew a lot of people in high places .
during an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin , albert speer , the minister of armaments , said to me , 'you look very tired dr. furtwngler , you should go abroad for a while . ' i knew exactly what he meant .
so , how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you ?
you did n't complain about the racial policies , just about the musical standards , is that right ?
i believe it was because of another letter i 'd written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies .
why were they going to arrest you ?
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me .
i do n't know , he was n't my case . why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended ?
then why is it , please , that another conductor who was actually a member of the party , who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts , has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait ?
tough , tough !
i need to work . i need to make my living . i live off the generosity of friends ...
your guess is as good as mine .
when will my case be heard by the tribunal ?
sure .
may i ask a question ?
or maybe you called goebbels or goering ? you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them .
let me me help you , then . you picked up the phone and made a call - 'hello , adolf ? wilhelm speaking . listen , old pal , there 's a jew-boy musician i want you to help . he needs a permit to get to paris . '
i may have , as ... as i said , i simply do n't remember .
did you call someone you knew ?
i do n't remember in detail , there were so many .
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape . how did you do that ?
it 's the truth .
i do n't buy that .
i made no deal !
could i have a glass of water , please ? please , fraulein ?
how come ?
that ... that was a different matter , i ... i was tricked .
that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies , wilhelm . and what about april 19 , 1942 ? the eve of hitler 's fifty- third birthday , the big celebration ; you conducted for hitler , did n't you ? was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other ?
i did not conduct at at the rally , i conducted on the evening before the rally .
then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies ?
well , there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture . i was simply a pawn . anyway , i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra . in 1934 .
goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you . one makes you a privy councillor , the other makes you vice-president of the chamber of music , and you were n't even a member of the party , how do you explain that ?
i do n't think dr. goebbels sent me a telegram . i was simply told . in a letter , i believe . i do n't remember exactly .
what about vice-president of the chamber of music , you used that title did n't you ? but then i suppose you had no choice there either , because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying , dear mr. vice-president .
i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor . i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse . after the dreadful events of november 1938 , the violent attacks on the jews , i stopped using the title .
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor . how did that happen to a non-party member ?
that is correct .
what they do in austria does n't interest me one little bit . okay ? i have your questionnaire here , gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwngler , born berlin , january 1886. orchestral conductor . and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party .
i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria .
i want you to understand why you 're here . you 're automatically banned from public life under control council directive no 24. we 're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission . you understand that ?
his private life ?
and ask him about his private life .
yes , yes you may notice that he can not even bring himself to utter his name , he ... he refers to him as k .
the miracle kid .
also a conductor . very brilliant . young . von der null called him 'the miracle von karajan ' . furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army . the same thing happened to another critic . true or not , it 's not such a bad idea . critics give you bad reviews , you have them sent to the russian front . but if you really want to get furtwngler , ask him about herbert von karajan .
who 's he ?
edwin von der null . music critic . he gave furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan .
never heard of him , who is he ?
there 's a rumour ... i do n't know if it 's true or not ... but ask him about von der null .
no . but that 's why we hated him . we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he did n't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us . he did n't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad . he got everything from them , everything . he was filthier than any of us party members .
but i need documentary proof . you know of anything like that ?
son-of-a-gun . we 'll find the corporal and we 'll find the telegram .
yes . a corporal . us army . a jew . he said he 'd seen the telegram in the chancellery .
one of my people ?
one of your people told me .
he did ?
furtwngler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday .
yeah ?
i 've remembered something else ...
of course . you , too . like everyone else in this goddamn country .
the only thing i know is he 's an anti-semite .
fuck that , helmuth . you want to discuss symbols here ? this guy was a front man . he was the piper , but he played their tune , you get my philosophical meaning ? i 'm not interested in small fish , i 'm after moby dick . come on , helmuth . hard facts .
major , we 're discussing a man of genius , i do n't want ...
i can give you freedom of movement , freedom to work , freedom , helmuth . but i need something in return .
you do n't know what it 's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified , you do n't know that -
oh , i see , he made you co-operate . and now are you a communist again ?
i was a member of the communist party . i was a communist . that 's what hinkel had over me . he knew everything . he held that over me . that 's how he made me co-operate .
was a member of ... ? speak up ?
one-zero-four-nine-three-three- one . or d'you mind if i just call you 'one ' ?
what ?
all in the cause of humanity , helmuth . or should i call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one ?
you usually do n't work on sunday , major ?
so . you wanted to see me .
great catch , kid . the boy runs off .
do n't worry , helmuth , it 'll be our secret .
exactly . replaces the baton , gives steve the case .
and i see what you mean . you nearly poked my eyes out .
do it , helmuth .
not here , major , there are people , if anybody should see ... please , please , major ...
yeah , show me , i want to see you do it . pretend i 'm adolf . you 're the maestro , and you have the baton in your right hand , but you give me the salute just the same .
show you ?
show me .
how could i forget ?
yes , you remember .
the one he kept in his right hand . yes , you remember .
it 's dr. furtwngler 's baton , which i stole .
love 'em , helmuth . i give up . what are you holding in your hand ?
guess what i am holding in my hand . you like guessing games ?
helmuth .
major .
how could i know what 's in the archive ?
do you know what 's in this archive ?
i hear the british have his ... his archive , files , records .
hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture ; how could i know such a man ? i
you seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?
do i know hans hinkel ?
that 's what i asked .
do i know hans hinkel ?
do you know hans hinkel ?
oh , we did n't play for his birthday , we played the evening before - it was the 19th of april not the 20th .
excuse me . did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience ?
i 'll ask the questions , helmuth .
is it true you 're going to interview dr. furtwngler today ?
me ? never . never .
good , and according to your questionnaire , helmuth , you never joined the nazi party .
it means i was n't good enough to be a first violinist .
helmuth alfred rode . second violinist since 1935. what 's it mean , second violinist ?
when you got to the crescendo .
i do n't know what you mean , major .
was looking at furtwngler like that ?
yes .
you ever seen adolf hitler 's eyes when he was making a speech ? i 've seen 'em on films .
politics and art must be kept separate . i 'll remember that . but let me see if you can help me with something i just do n't understand . i 'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him . what 's his secret ?
yes , dr. furtwngler was absolutely clear about this : politics and art must be kept separate .
oh ! the evening before , i see ...
he was forced to do that . but he refused to give the nazi salute in front of hitler . he kept his baton in his hand , you ca n't salute with a baton in your hand .
but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday .
goebbels , yes , josef goebbels said , 'there 's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwngler has not intervened . ' no , no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwngler .
well , he 's more than just a bandleader , steve . he 's a great conductor , a gifted artist . but we believe that he sold himself to the devil . your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the nazi party . do n't be impressed by him . i want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war . find wilhelm furtwngler guilty . he represents everything that was rotten in germany .
like this bandleader .
well , they say here that when you went on a case , you stayed on it . now we ca n't take every nazi in this country to trial , although i would like to ; it 's an impossibility . so we 're going for the big boys in industry , education , law , culture .
they said i was dogged ?
conscientious , determined , dogged .
right . claims assessor .
you were in insurance before the war .
jeez , and i never heard of him .
he 's as big as toscanini , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he 's probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one .
sure .
do you know who arturo toscanini is ?
nope .
so , you never heard of him .
do you really think it was brave ? did n't he bow to him and shake his hand ?
it was beethoven 's ninth .
brave ? to celebrate hitler 's birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute ? bravo .
yes , that 's true , but he refused to give the nazi salute . he kept his baton in his right hand . in hitler 's presence . that was a brave act ...
he also conducted for hitler , did n't he ?
it was hermann goering . i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor , no questions asked . although dr. furtwngler stood up to him . and to dr. goebbels .
then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor ?
dr. furtwngler is a great musician . he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape .
hey , hey , slow up , fraulein straube has to take down what you say .
no , i was never a nazi , i have no interest in politics , i 'm a musician -
absolutely not .
i have your questionnaire here . it says you were never a member of the nazi party .
first oboe .
rudolf otto werner . wind section since 1936. what instrument did you play ?

it 'll never be over , will it ? look at me , i 'm shaking . some legend , huh ? you must be pretty disappointed .
if i do , you have to get away , disappear without a trace . different country , different name , everything . in case they send another one .
do n't say that .
probably . sarah , if i get zeroed ...
he 'll find us , wo n't he ?
i want it to be over for me too . i feel like i slipped over some invisible line , that i 'm in your world now . everything 's the same , but i see it differently . it 's like , there 's you and me , and him ... but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us .
not possible .
i want it to be over for you .
my whole life has been combat .
i want to buy you a hot dog so bad , kyle ... all the things you 've never seen and done . you 're here , but wherever you go , and whatever you touch , you bring the war with you .
hot dogs ?
i was thinking , there 's so much i 've got to show you when we get through this . it 's mind boggling , the pos- sibilities ... disneyland , the beach , movies ... matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs ...
that 's good . now , seven more like that while i make fuses .
you must have had a fun child-
make sure there 's none on the threads , like this . now screw the end-cap on ... very gently .
nitroglycerin , basically . bit more stable . i learned howto make it when i was a kid .

kyle ?
fuck you ! let go of me !
let 's go . time to move out .
listen . understand . i 'm not a military objective , reese . i 'm a person ... you do n't own me .
that 's not my mission .
reese . think it through . we can prevent the war . nobody else is gon na do it . if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again . we have to so it ourselves .
tactically dangerous . we lay low .
well , we 're gon na uninvent the bastard . eighty-six it . we 'll blow up the place ... burn it down . something .

'sarah , thank you . for your courage through the dark years . i ca n't help you with what you must soon face , except to tell you that the future is not set ... there is no such thing as fate , but what we make for ourselves by our own will . you must be stronger than you imagine you can be . you must survive , or i will never exist . ' that 's all .
look , reese , i did n't ask for this honor and i do n't want it . any of it .

and anyway , what do i know about guerrilla warfare ?
ow ! no , it 's okay . it 's better tight .
come on , me ? the mother of the future ? am i tough ? organized ? i ca n't even balance my checkbook . i cry when i see a cat that 's been run over ... and i do n't even like cats .
i 'm sure .
it was an honor . a chance to meet the legend . sarah connor . who taught her son to fight ... organize , prepare . from when he was a kid . when you were in hiding , before the war .
you volunteered ?
i volunteered .
stop ! i do n't want to know . hold still . so ... it was john that ordered you here ?
john never said much about him . he dies . even before the war ...
well , at least i know what to name him . i do n't suppose you 'd know who the father is ? so i do n't tell him to get lost when i meet him .
you trust him . he 's got that strength . you 'd die in a second for john .
what 's he like ?

hunter killers . patrol machines . build in automated factories . most of us were rounded up , put in camps ... for orderly disposal .
the what ?
did n't see the war . i was born after , in the ruins . grew up there . starving . hiding from the h-k 's .
defense network computer . new . powerful . hooked into everything . trusted to run it all . they say it got smart ... a new order of intelli- gence . then it saw all people as a threat , not just the ones on the other side . decided out fate in a microsecond ... extermination .
i do n't understand ...
-- everythingis gone . just gone . there were survivors . here . there . nobody knew who started it . it was the machines .
tell me . just start at the beginning .
there 's so much ...
listen . understand . that terminator is out there . it ca n't be reasoned with , it ca n't be bargained with ... it does n't feel pity of remorse or fear ... and it absolutely will not stop . ever . until you are dead .
just let me go .
right .
and you 're from the future too ?
one possible future . four your point of view . i do n't know the tech stuff .
so , it 's from the future , is that right ?
no . not yet . not for about forty years .
hey , i 'm not stupid , y'know . they ca n't build anything like that yet .
pay attention . the 600 series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . sweat , bad breath , everything . very hard to spot . i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him .
look , reese , i know you want to help , but ...
but outside , it 's living human tissue . flesh , skin , hair ... blood . grown for the cyborgs .
no . but you will . it 's very important that you live .
this is a mistake . i have n't done anything .
i 'm here to help you . reese , sergeant/tech-com , dn38416 ...
yes . do n't hurt me .
do you understand ?
who is in authority here ?
i can help you ...
then why am i talking to you ? get out .
i 'm afraid that 's not up to me .
you 've heard enough . decide . are you going to release me ?
most official records were lost in the war . the computer knew almost nothing about connor 's mother . her name . where she lived , just the city . no scanner pictures . the terminator was just being systematic .
why were the other two women killed ?
of course .
surrounded by living tissue .
okay . okay . but this ... cyborg ... if it 's metal ...
i did n't build the fucking thing .
why ?
you go naked . something about the field generated by a living organism . nothing dead will go .
ca n't . nobody goes home . nobody else comes through . it 's just him and me .
then how are you supposed to get back ?
... it had no choice . the defensive grid was smashed . we 'd taken the mainframes ... we 'd won . taking out connor then would make no difference . skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence . we captured the lab complex . found the ... what- ever it was called ... the time-displacement equipment . the terminator had already gone through . they sent two of us to intercept , then zeroed the whole place . sumner did n't make it .
yes .
i see . and this ... computer , thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy , kill- ing him , in effect , before he is even conceived ? a sort of retroactive abortion ?
skynet . a computer defense system built for sac-norad by cyber dynamics . a modified series 4800 .
and who was the enemy ?
the year 2027 ?
with the one thirty second under perry , from '21 to '27 --
so . you 're a soldier . fighting for whom ?
okay .
go ahead . you 're safe . there 're thirty cops in this building .
i ca n't sleep .
why do n't you just stretch out here and get some sleep . it 'll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands .
i guess so . you 're a doctor ?
sarah . sarah , this is dr. silber- man . i 'd like you to tell him everything reese said to you . do you feel up to it ?
they 've already been identi- fied . there 's no doubt .
lieutenant , are you sure it 's them ? maybe i should see the ... bodies .
here , drink some of this ...
alright , ms. connor . listen carefully . you 're in a public place , you 'll be safe 'til we get there . stay visible . do n't go outside or in the restroom . i 'll be there in a few minutes .
yes , but i do n't want to leave . i think this guy 's following me .
i wo n't . now just relax . where are you ? yeah , i know it ... on pico . are you alright ?
... look , lieutenant ... uh , vukovich , do n't put me on hold and do n't transfer me to another department ...
shut up .
that silberman just crack me up . he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire . screwed it first , then set it on --
suspect westbound on olympic . grey sedan . has hostage , repeat ...
go ! go ! he 's got her .
like shit , boss .
if they can get this on the tube by eleven , she may just call us . how do i look ?
to make a statement . i 'm gon na give them the name . maybe the jackals can help us out for once .
i hate the press cases . especially the weird press cases . where you going ?
i can hear it now , it 's gon na be the goddamned 'phone book killer ' .
same shit .
call her again .
i just called .
call her .
i already did . no answer at the door and the apartment manager 's out . i 'm keeping them there .
send a unit .
no . keep getting an answer- ing machine .
did you reach the next girl yet ?
i put a cigarette out in it .
i know .
that stuff 's two hours cold .
i hate the weird ones .
you got ta be kidding me . the new guys 'll be short-stroking it over this one . a one-day pattern killer .
here 's her driver 's license .
that ca n't be right . that 's the name of the one valley division mopped up this after- noon .
okay , let 's see ... got a pos- itive on her . she 's sarah connor , works as a legal --
six shots at less than ten feet . weapon was a large caliber --
give me the short version .
we met , this morning . i signed the termination contract for baer/grace . i accepted your settlement , nicholas . you were right . i 'm going sailing .
no . this is my lawyer , samuel sutherland . i thought you two should meet .
are you finished ?
you could . but , if i leave without your signature , this agreement begins to disintegrate ; benefits shrink , options narrow , compensations shrivel .
i could fight you on this .
remember daniel grant ? do they say , `` without daniel grant , there is no baer/grant publishing ? '' he 's gone sailing , alan . he 's out there enjoying his golden years , probably wondering where you are .
there is no baer/grant publishing without alan baer .
i 'll be done in a minute . you misspoke before . you 're not `` stepping down . '' i 'm taking you out at the knees . the whole point is to prove that you 're not deciding anything anymore . i 'm firing you . action 's taken . confidence restored . stock goes up . i sell my shares .
now , look ...
it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father . or , did you think this , between us , was friendship ? just because you went fishing with my father , i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away ?
your father was a friend . goddamn it ... i watched you grow up . how do you end up treating me like this ?
what ?
you intractable son-of-a-bitch . if your father could see you now ...
you 're talking tomorrow . today is what counts .
because it 's fair . give me next quarter . if you still feel this way , vote your shares ...
it probably will . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will , in time . why should i settle for that ?
the stock will turn .
my stock 's falling . is n't yours ? those pennies are costing me millions .
will you really hold me to it over < u > pennies < /u > ?
but , the expectation was ten . and , in this case , expectation is everything .
our e.p.s . was one fifty last quarter . we 're up eight cents per share .
admittedly ...
projections were far too optimistic .
you promised you 'd meet projections , alan . a dollar sixty per share you said . so , i do n't think this is so surprising a visit .
`` whereas once i was blind , now i can see . '' night , nick . best of luck .
i , uh ... have n't been to sunday school in years ...
you want to know what it is ? what it 's all about ? john . chapter nine . verse twenty-five .
i 've heard good things about their london branch . you have to admit , it sounds like some fantasy , role-playing nonsense .
hm ? no , about a year ago . i was working out of los angeles .
did you play recently ?
did you ? kudos .
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon , down on montgomery street .
i 'll be right with you .
fine , dennis . soon as i get my money for this week .
clean out your locker .
i apologized , i offered to help .
you do n't talk to me like that .
then , you kiss his ass .
christine ! mister van orton is a valued customer ...
always .
underwear ?
no .
boyfriend ?
yes .
single ?
julliard , yeah .

one brother , one sister .
big family ... small ?

there 's another gig starting in saudi arabia . i 'm just a walk-on this time though . bit-part .
where are you going in such a hurry ?
i have to get to the airport ...
claire . pleased to meet you .
claire .
i did n't know what else to call you .
that 's my fault . i get too worked up at these . i 'm very method . you do know ... that 's not my name .
hi . did n't get a chance to say goodbye .
no !
i have to show you ...
do n't move , you bitch ... !
please , nicholas , let me show you ...
stop it !
open that door , you 'll see . your brother 's there ... conrad . he 's there . it 's your birthday party ...
no ...
it is . it 's what you hired us for . nobody touched your money . nobody stole anything . they 're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne ... all your friends ... it 's a celebration ...
that 's not true ...
think about it ! they followed you every step of the way . there was always a safety net . the taxi , there was a diver . at my house , the window was rigged ... they shot at us with blanks ...
you 're wrong . you 're about to make the biggest mistake of your life . put that gun down .
no ! you take another step , i 'll shoot ! they 're trying to kill me ...
let me show you ...
shut up !
nicholas ...
stop talking ...
okay ... okay ... i put it down . now open that door . mister fisher 's right on the other side of that door . he 's an actor ...
stop talking to them !
what did you < u > really see < /u > ? this whole time ... special effects , squibs , like in the movies . please , you 've got to believe me ... he 's got a gun , with real bullets !
i saw them kill him !
no , now wait ... think about it . what did you see ... ?
bullshit . they killed him . feingold , fisher , whoever ... they shot him ...
listen very carefully , i 'm telling the truth ... this is the game . this was all the game .
fuck you .
nicholas , this is fake . it 's all part of the game ...
what are you doing ?
he 's got a gun . everyone , he 's got a < u > real < /u > gun up here ! real situation ! ... damn it ...
just ... wait . just wait ! okay ... please , i 'm not kidding anymore ...
guess you missed it .
we searched the house .
it 's mine ...
where 'd you get that gun ?
what the fuck are you ... ?
that gun . that ... that 's not automatic . the guard had an automatic ...
... what ... ?
where 'd you get that ... ?
they will ! you tell them if they do n't come now , i will shoot you !
they wo n't ...
call them , tell them to get the boss up here . tell them i 'll kill you ...
it could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank .
you call them ...
it was n't you . it was n't personal ...
who 's responsible ? !
how deluded can you be ? there 's no < u > why < /u > ...
you tell me ... i want to know who 's behind this . who did this to me ... how , why ... ?
what do you think you 're doing ?
get us out !
nicholas ...
get us out of here ...
nicholas , okay ... you 're not about to shoot anyone ...
i 'm back from the dead .
what are you < u > doing < /u > here ?
it 's out of your hands .
what ... what do you mean ?
mm ... i would n't worry about it .
what do you mean ? i checked them myself . i made the calls ...
who is it ?
what do we do ?
who is it ?
whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before , this is more than just me . your friends raided pension plans , and payrolls ... they took just over six-hundred million . you ruined people 's lives .
i do n't know . a lot .
scams , con games . how many ?
what ?
how many times have you done this ? i 'm interested .
all i mean is ... someone like you ...
it might be best if we did n't talk .
it 's just money . you should be glad you 're alive .
who the fuck cares ?
my name 's not christine . it 's not my real ...
i did n't say anything .
what did you say ?
they do n't care about you anymore . alive or dead is the same , as long as they bury you deep enough .
overseas operator ? please dial allgemeine bank , zurich .
why else would they be willing to put you under ... ?
what are you talking about ... ?
they did the same to him as they did to you .
how ? how could they have gotten anything ?
it was n't his fault . he thought it was his only way back . they fleeced him real good .
yeah ? i was your waitress on your birthday . connie told you about c.r.s . that day , remember ? i was already playing my part , < u > before < /u > you started the game .
that 's a lie ...
i know things ... like who you can trust . like that your brother was in on it from the beginning .
then , what good are you ?
i do n't know , nobody does . i 'm an employee .
who are `` they ? ''
no cops . i 've got a warrant out . mail fraud . they 'll take me in , but you wo n't be able to prove anything else .
you can talk while i drive us to the police .
you do n't have a choice . no one else is going to tell you what 's going on .
get out of my car !
i could 've handed you to them . they find me now , i 'm dead ...
get out .
what are you doing ... ?
god , wake up , it 's a con !
what is this ! ?
nicholas ...
no ! i 'm sick of this ...
not here ! they can see .
wha ... ?
they 're watching .
i do n't ...
take the picture out of the frame and show it to me .
what 's wrong ?
take the picture out .
yeah . first communion . are n't i a little angel ?
you ?
want anything to drink ?
let me go get some clothes on . we 'll talk , okay ? be right back .
i 'm tired . i 'm sorry , i should go . i 've been enough of a nuisance .
sure . you alright ? is this still that contest you 're in ...
do you mind if i sit ?
i thought ...
okay .
well ... the red bra .
i think i would remember . what makes you think it 's me ?
it was left in my hotel room , well , not really mine . you 're saying it 's not you ?
where 'd you get this ?
is this you ?
what is it ?
come here ...
did n't think i 'd ever see you again .
it 's okay , dad .
can we talk ?
what are you doing here ?
they said five hundred . i said six . they said the man in the gray flannel suit . i think i said , you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit ?
seriously ? what did they say ?
i have a confession to make . someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you , as a practical joke .
keep it .
give me an address so i can send your shirt back .
goodnight , christy . it was nice meeting you .
right . call me christy .
the maitre d ' called you christine .
i do n't think i 've ever spent this much time with someone who did n't even ask my name .
goodnight .
do n't . it was a shitty job anyway . i overreacted .
i know the owner of campton place . i could talk to him in the morning .
i do n't spend much time looking out the window . i 'll call you a taxi .
if this was my office , i would n't keep that closed .
a fresh shirt ...
hm ? oh , yes .
nice .
investment banking . moving money from place to place .
what exactly do you do ?
that tall , bright building . near there .
where are we going ?
i think not .
we hang down here and drop . the garbage 'll break our fall .
why ... ?
that 's classic .
nicholas van orton ? what are you , a czar ?
nicholas . nicholas van orton .
never did catch your name .
... two hundred dollars a toe .
that one did .
your < u > shoes < /u > cost a thousand dollars ?
there goes a thousand dollars .
me ? you 're the one who ... ! shit !
you 're the one who started running .
you 're a grown man . i 'm not responsible for you .
you deserted me .
yes ... well ...
they 'll love that .
do n't panic . when security gets here , we simply explain what happened ...
consumer recreation services . it 's their building . they ...
what 's c.r.s . ?
this is c.r.s .
it 's not like anyone could actually open it .
i 'll wait .
my hero . let 's go .
there 's a ladder here .
oh . fine .
i 'm not wearing underwear . okay ? there , i said it . satisfied .
please ...
no .
it 's much easier this way . come on , step up ...
you pull me up .
this is n't an attempt to be gallant . if i do n't lift you , how are you going to get there ?
you first .
i 'll give you a boost .
are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us ?
`` ... wait for help . '' wait for help . i 'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to .
if there was one .
read what it says : `` warning , do < u > not < /u > attempt to open . if elevator stops , use emergency ... ``
why not ?
do n't even think about it .
never mind .
long story . i found this key in the mouth of a wooden harlequin .
how thoughtful . the gift of inconvenience .
it was a gift ... from my brother .
where 'd you all go ? motherfucking frat boys . you better hide . is your life so pathetic that this is something you 're willing to pay for ?
how do you know that 's the way ?
home .
where are you going ?
see you around .
i do n't understand why they 're getting you involved .
there 's got to be a flashlight .
you should be .
i 'm sorry , about this ...
you mean , the guy who turned blue and < u > wet < /u > himself ... ?
the lights went out , one hundred people all ran away ...
what are you talking about ?
it 's run by a company ... they play elaborate pranks . things like this . i 'm really only now finding out myself .
a game ?
i was trying to tell you ... it 's a game .
what ... is ... happening ... ?
you 've got to be kidding .
hold on ... they want your driver 's license number .
let 's talk to whoever can get this over with ...
ten minutes ago , i 'm looking forward to a quiet dinner . i get a note ...
what < u > is < /u > your problem ?
this is nuts .
he 's turning blue !
alright ... okay ...
he 's pissing his pants . is that real enough for you ? call 911 !
this ca n't be real ...
do n't just stand there , get help !
oh , god ... !
i do n't think he 's breathing .
do you know what to do ?
i do n't know ... he fell .
what 's with him ?
do n't explain . fuck off . goodbye .
excuse me , i need to explain ...
what 's going on ? i 'm going on my second job this month , and now i 'm going on unemployment .
i want to know what 's going on . are you part of this ?
what are you babbling about , psycho ?
i 'm not sure how this works . do you have something for me ... ? i got this note ...
oh , no ... you .
pardon me ... miss ... ?
i said i was sorry ...
terrific . i now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill .
it was an accident .
do n't help me , just get more napkins . and soda water .
a bad month . you did the exact same thing to me last week .
i apologize , sir , i 'm having a bad day ...
please , do n't do that ...
i 'm so sorry .
did she ?
yeah , yeah . she called a cab . said something about catching a plane .
where 's christine ? the waitress .
oh , god yes please . thanks , man . i 'll take you up on that .
split it ?
yeah .
really ?
this ... ? oh , this is just ... this is the bill .
what ?
baby , they were all over the house with metal detectors . they switched your gun with a look-alike , rigged barrel , loaded with blanks . pop-gun .
you know ... how 'd you manage the gun ? i mean ...
stop it !
i 'm sorry , christ , i 'm sorry ! how many more times do i have to say i 'm sorry before you forgive me ... ?
stop this . it 's not true ...
because you hate me . because you had to be here , when mom died . because you had to do it alone . well , do n't you think if i 'd known ... i'd 've been here too . i 'd have been here ...
listen to yourself . why would i do anything like what you 're describing ?
you 're behind this , are n't you ? you and your sick friends . well , make it stop !
no , it does n't ! those keys were put there . i did n't even know ...
no ! you 're one of them . of course , it makes perfect sense !
what ? connie ...
you 're part of it ...
how did those ... ?
no . do you ? ca n't be too hard , can it ? i do n't think we should be here out in the open like this .
do you know how to change a tire ?
really ?
the phone 's dead .
okay ... okay .
we 're going to figure this out . get a grip on yourself .
how do you know ?
it 's a flat tire . that 's all .
it 's them . they did this .
you think i know ? i paid them < u > more < /u > to make it stop .
calm down . why would they keep playing after you paid ?
everything . i 'm a goddamn human-pinata ...
what have they been doing to you ?
it does n't stop , nick . i paid the bill , i gave 'em their money , but it all started again . they wo n't leave me alone ...
slow down , take a breath ...
they fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you . and then , just when you think it 's done , that 's when the < u > real < /u > fucking begins .
how do you mean , exactly ?
you dodged a bullet .
yeah , almost ...
c.r.s . who do you think ? jesus h. , thank your lucky charms . to think what i almost got you into .
who ?
they 're methodical . they 're nothing if they 're not that .
what are you doing ?
shhhhhhh . wait ... wait ...
what 's this all about , connie ?
just drive , man . it 's fucking nuts !
tell me where we 're going .
i know ...
okay , okay ... okay ? i just ... you know i hate surprises .
do it for you .
i 'm going to call .
it does n't matter ...
i 'll call them , okay ?
i thought you 'd like this . best thing i ever did . if you do n't want to do it , do n't ...
why would you say that ?
are you still on mediction ?
but , will you ?
i said i would ...
will you ?
okay .
tell me you 'll call .
call them . trust me .
like a stroke ?
it 's a profound life experience .
this is n't an escort service ?
you 've heard of it . you 've seen other people having it . they 're an entertainment service , but more than that .
fun ?
they make your life fun . their only guarantee is you will not be bored .
why ?
trust me . call that number .
`` consumer recrreation services . '' what , do they make golf clubs ?
call that number .
you should n't have .
for you .
i do n't need anything from you . i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain , naked , and , it hit me -- nickie 's birthday . so , here i am , four layovers , twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later . not necessarily in that order .
really ?
no .
you need anything ?
yeah .
connie ... what brings you here ? is everything alright ?
nowhere in particular . do n't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore ?
i redecorated . what about you ?
too bad , i liked her . so , you 're all alone in the house of pain ?
divorced . remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist , or pediatric gynaecologist , in sausalito .
elizabeth ?
never better .
how long 's it been ? since mom died ... four years ? how are you ?
about me ?
so do you . and to think i was worried ...
you look good .
which grad-school ?
not after i 'm done with it . actually , i 've been here . in grad-school i bought crystal-meth from the maitre d ' .
they 'll be wanting it back .
they gave me a free jacket at the door .
that 's why it 's a classic . come on , man ... how 'bout a hug ... ?
`` seymour butts . '' i never get tired of that one .
happy birthday , man .
conrad , what a surprise . gesundheit .
hey there , nickie .
yes , very lucky .
how much is it ? a few thousand , at least . a rolex like that ... lucky for you they missed it .
and , they did n't take that watch ?
yes .
we 'll help with the police , if you want to bother . as far as money goes ... can i make a suggestion ? you say you were mugged ?
i do n't speak spanish . all i need is to get back ... just enough for that .
have you gone to the police ?
yes .
robbed ?
what happened was , i 'm on vacation , alone ... i was robbed , at gunpoint . they hit me and ran . two men , a few blocks away . they took my wallet , money ... all of it . so ...
it always is .
well , where to begin . it 's complicated ...
no money , no identification or passport . you are in a fix . what did happen to you ?
i know .
i 'll call . i really will .
happy birthday , nicholas .
you 're going ? well , thanks again . good to see you , rachel ... thanks for coming , mel . i 'll get your car back . right now it 's , uh ... at the zoo . sorry .
we have to head out ... just wanted to say goodbye .
i hope .
i 'll explain someday .
yes .
it 's just a t.v . he 's just an actor .
of course , nick ...
it would mean a lot to me ... if you and i could be friends . if i could have you back in my life ... in some small way . it would be important .
there 's nothing to forgive .
the last few days , um ... i 've been thinking ... had a lot of spare time . i want to tell you ... i 'm starting to understand why you left me . i 've been resenting you for it , maybe , but ... i want to apologize , for all of it . for shutting you out , for not being there . i ... anyway , i hope you can forgive me .
of course you can have it if you need it . can i get you something to eat ?
i know , look at me , well ... what happened ? i do n't know . i do n't even really know . i have some things to try to take care of ... i need the car a little while .
what happened to you , nick ? i mean , look at yourself ...
i need your car , elizabeth .
like , this way ... sort of ...
guess !
it was a different floor then ...
where 'd you pick up your checks ?
i told you , they hired me over the phone . i never met anyone .
where ?
shut up . cuff him to the rail .
you do n't need me ...
i do n't want money . i 'm pulling back the curtain . i 'm here to meet the wizard .
what are you gon na do anyway ? you wo n't get your money back .
drive in .
what whistle ? there 's no fucking whistle . this is fucking dangerous .
tell them the cops are after you ... tell them you 've got to talk to someone , i 'm threatening to blow the whistle .
no , i ca n't . i 'm sorry and all , but ...
they know you ... you worked for them . you can get me in .
they own the whole building . they just move from floor to floor .
how do i find them ? their offices are empty .
goddamnit , why do they do that ?
nobody knows , pal . nobody gets the big picture ... jason , tommy , cut it out !
i 'm tired of dealing with peons . i need to get to whoever 's in charge .
look , it was just a job . nothing personal , ya know ? i play my part , improvise a little . that 's what i 'm good at .
hey , everyone -- snack time ! here ... here you go ...
get rid of them .
that 's right -- you 're a left-brain word fetishist .
you mean , < u > dis < /u > satisfied .
it 's never happened . we 've never had an unsatisfied customer .
you mean , i do n't like it , he does n't pay ?
one guarantee . payment 's entirely at your brother 's discretion and , as a gift , dependent on your satisfaction .
it 's all down to this ...
do n't worry . it 's been terrific spending the entire day with your `` crack team '' .
sorry to keep you waiting .
cursory examination . turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing . you 'll be out of here in no time .
physical ?
an hour for those ... maybe another for the physical .
how long will these take ?
first , admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing . second , you do n't have to decide today . take the silly tests , fill out the forms . one day , the game begins . you either love it or hate it . decide then . we 're like an experimental book-of-the-month- club ; drop out at any time with no further obligation . that was my sales pitch .
do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing ?
may i make two suggestions ... ?
and if nothing 's lacking ?
we provide whatever 's lacking .
humor me with specifics .
it 's different every time .
what kind of vacation ?
tailored specifically to each participant . think of it as a great vacation , except you do n't go to it , it comes to you .
a game ?
oh ... it 's a game .
no , i mean , what is it for ? what are you selling ?
we want a sense of your overall capabilities , limitations , turn-ons , turn-offs ...
what 's all this for ?
i do n't write the questions . i just review them .
you need to fill out those forms . application , psych-tests : m.m.p.i . and t.a.t . for the financial questionnaire , do n't answer anything you do n't feel like . we 'll run a t.r.w ... .
no , thank you .
your brother was a client with our london branch . we do a sort of informal scoring . his numbers were outstanding . sure you 're not hungry at all ... ? tung hoy , best in chinatown ...
what is ?
v-a-n ... o-r-t-o-n ... a gift from conrad van orton . interesting ...
oh , here we go ...
i 'm not quite sure how this works . my brother ...
jim feingold , v.p. , e.d.a . engineering and data analysis .
first they try to kill me , now you ? put your damn clothes back on .
is n't this what you like ? they told me you had a thing for boats .
do n't take another step .
do n't be nervous . they said you 'd be nervous .
i ca n't tell you how < u > not < /u > interested i am .
i 've been so lonely .
they were my husband 's . my late husband ... may he rest in peace .
you know , these fit ... perfectly .
let 's get you dried off first . i might have some clothes below .
i need the police .
no , you did n't ...
did n't i give you two ?
is there a room key ?
hm ?
the key ?
show mr. van orton to his room .
have we met ?
ah , mr. van orton . here you go ...
goodnight . where was she ?
goodnight . see you home .
nobody worried about your father .
did you worry about him ?
you 're not like him at all . i do n't know exactly what 's going on around here lately , but do n't make me start worrying about you .
i 'm just like him .
not much , i think .
sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me .
no . what happened ... no one expected it .
was he morose , or ... ? i mean ...
your mother thought he was a good man . he worked very hard . what i remember most was his manner was so ... slight . it was easy to spend time in a room , and not realize he 'd been there the whole time .
he came to my mind recently , that 's all .
all the time i 've known you , you 've never once asked about him .
i 'm not sure .
what makes you ask ?
there 's been a break in . lock this door and stay here . do n't move a muscle .
i do n't know what you 're talking about . what 's happened ?
did the alarm go off ? the house ... they ... you did n't see ... ?
yes . what do you mean ? what 's wrong ?
ilsa ... you 're alright ?
mr. van orton ... ?
goodnight then .
no , thank you . goodnight .
i 've finished for the evening . will you be needing anything else ?
fine .
is everything alright ?
well ... send my love , if you see him again .
okay . i think he 's into some sort of new personal improvement cult .
you did ? how is he ?
thank you . goodnight .
dinner 's in the oven .
have a nice day .
thank you .
there was an incident a few days ago ... a nervous breakdown , they said . the police took him . they left this address , in case anyone ...
look , where is he ? !
he could n't , or refused to pay . we extended credit ...
his behavior ... ?
there were complaints by other guests , and damage to his room . we did the best we could to accommodate his behavior .
where 's my brother ?
it 's a private matter , for you ... i think you 'll be more comfortable ...
what 's this about ?
your brother . will you come with me ?
pleasure to meet you , i 'd like to see my brother , thank you .
you 're here for conrad van orton ? i 'm the hotel manager ...
what 's the trouble ?
cancel lunch . make reservations at campton place for me and mr. butts .
pardon me ? i 'm afraid i do n't ...
`` under the bleachers '' ... by seymour butts .
a mister ... seymour butts .
what gentleman , maria ?
a gentleman left a message requesting a lunch , but i assured him ...
what ?
i would n't mention the following , except he was very insistent . it 's obviously some sort of prank ...
i do n't like her .
i know who she is . take a message .
your ex-wife .
because , if you do n't know about society , you do n't have the satisfaction of avoiding it .
i 'll send your regrets . honestly , why must i even bother ?
let me think ... hordes of men in tuxedos . everyone 's droning . ludwell 's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick ...
the hinchberger wedding .
no .
the fitzwilliam botanical garden annual fundraiser .
no .
invitations : the museum gala .
nice touch . does the game use real bullets ... ?
hey ... !
friend ... why do n't you back off .
is alan baer `` the game ? '' is that what this is ?
look ... what i 'm doing is none of your business ...
i do n't know what you 're talking about . i 'm just driving ...
why are you following me ?
what the fuck ... ? !
you warm my heart .
bravo , young man . you have to tell me what this was all about sometime . i want you to know ... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane ... i was fully prepared to have you committed to the < u > finest < /u > mental-health facility available . i mean that sincerely , do n't thank me .
attempted murder .
illegal surveillance , reckless endangerment ...
what about the house ?
he has n't called back .
sam ... thank you .
very well . if you tell me not to worry , i sha n't .
it 's what they do . it 's like ... being toyed with by a bunch of ... depraved children .
you 're joking .
christ ... i ca n't believe it ... invisible ink ?
nothing else ?
just what i told you .
sounds like they make tennis rackets . what do we know ?
find out about a company called c.r.s . consumer recreation services .
you know you can .
someone 's playing hardball . it 's complicated . can i ask a favor ?
it was a misunderstanding .
how concerned should i be ?
that you 've involved conrad ... is unforgivable . i am now your enemy .
nicholas ...
follow me .
what 's happened ...
i checked it personally .
do n't ask .
attractive ...
wanted to wish you luck . not that you 'll need it .
i was n't expecting you .
nothing . nothing at all .
anything wrong ... ?
< u > every < /u > year is a good year .
what ?
you know what i love about wine that comes in bottles like this ?
it 's not victorian , everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was victorian . this is gothic , this is english craftsman , this is romanesque . this is ... insane . who lives here ?
these old victorian houses are great , are n't they ?
greetings fellow sheep counter .
greetings fellow insomniac .
hi . i 'm todd aubochon .
is this true ? i 've been hypnotized ?
modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations . you brought us here to scare us . insomnia , that was just a decoy issue . you 're disgusting .
it 's somebody 's idea of a joke .
welcome home eleanor . welcome home ? i 've never been here . who did this ?
i did okay .
could n't get the last ones . you ?
come on . these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist .
the children . the children hugh crain built the house for . the children he never had .
who 's watts ?
i only saw theo drive up .
obsessive worrier . join the club . and you ? i 'd guess ...
well , i ... uh ...
and what kind of sleeper ?
uh ... nell vance ...
hi , luke sanderson , bad sleeper , i 'm your basic tosser-turner , and you are ...
watts . those were his keys nell found . his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to . i think he 's here .
you 're not telling us something .
just stay there , nell !
it 's not going to hold your weight .
she got the child labor stuff from me .
it 's a question .
is that the question of compassion or science ?
you get your money .
do we still get paid for the week ?
i gave my key to the gate to todd , but the dudleys 'll be here in the morning .
there 's a carriage house around back .
and those are luke 's and mine .
go ahead .
do you need me anymore ? cause i 'm going to bed . they can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want , but i got ta try to get some sleep .
i 've read your tests .
why ?
because ... well , i know i can trust you .
sure .
luke , can i talk to you ?
yeah .
that could have been worse .
i thought it best to be isolated , to be in a location with a definite sense of history , and i wanted to make sure that it was n't so pleasant you 'd all sleep too easily . you 'll be taking a variety of tests , none of them harmful , and you 've got the house , the grounds , and each other to keep you company .
so why did you need the addam 's family mansion for a scientific test ?
greetings .
and this is my assistant , mary lambretta .
we ca n't stay here looking for her . she does n't want to be found ...
nell !
where in the hell can she be .
was sure she 'd be in here .
-- how much is this car worth ?
nell --
will the two of you shut up ! god damn it ! maybe the tests were right , marrow . she 's sensitive , she 's vulnerable , but i do n't think she 's suicidal and i did n't have to test her . maybe she was n't trying to kill herself . maybe she was really scared . maybe she really heard voices .
you used the wrong test .
maybe someday .
you want company ?
yeah .
all night ?
that depends on your definition of ghosts . i 'm going to check on her , and then i 'm going to stay awake .
you do n't really believe it 's haunted ... do you believe in ghosts ?
we 're fucked . we 're in a haunted house and we ca n't get out until the morning .
the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection . like he says it 's about one thing , a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia ... and that 'd be a legitimate study , but i think that we 've been subjected to an academic bait and switch ; he 's really looking at something else .
mister very talky , would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you ?
no .
so could you ! is this some fucked up idea of art , putting someone else 's name to a painting ?
you could have .
i did n't do it .
he must have left . did n't like the looks of the place or something .
well , this lot is full !
luke .
hey ! i heard screaming ...
and why did n't marrow tell < u > us < /u > ? does n't he trust women ? that fuck .
he said that hugh crain ... hugh crain was a monster . he said that he was a brutal , horrible man . he told me that crain drove his workers to early deaths . crain had children chained to the looms in his mill . and listen to this : his beautiful rene killed herself .
nah , you 're going crazy with doubt , all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes , and it 's worse than a nightmare . --
the rest of you may hate your insomnia , but i find it the best time of the day for me . i 'm alone . nobody 's talking to me but myself . my mind is racing with ideas , and i can think .
this is the last chapter . please , please give me clearance . it 's for science .
i have a bad feeling about what you 're doing .
she needed a job , malcolm . and she 's smart . and she helps me .
i , i just ca n't ...
no .
does she know that 's why you 're using her ?
no , but she does , and that 's all that matters .
you do n't believe in the paranormal .
and after she was thrown out , she needed a job .
why are you working with her ? mary lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a ph.d. in psychic studies .
mary , i 'll meet you outside .
are you working with her ?
but if the group knows it 's being studied as a group , you contaminate the results . the deception is minor .
not the way you 've constructed your group , it 's just not ethical !
no , malcolm ! individual performance is only part of it . i know why baseball players choke for no reason , i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert , and need to , to give a great performance , but what i want to know is , how fear works in a group ...
and that will be a good place to end this study .
malcolm , this is essential work i 'm doing . just think what my research can do for education . elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports , where loud noise is random ; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read .
come on malcolm , it 's only seven ohms , it 's nothing , it 's like a joy buzzer ! and it 's not about the pain , it 's about the interference with concentration ...
it 's still an electric shock !
nothing , if you leave right now . there 's a war going on all around us . do n't get in the way , please .
what 'll happen to us , nell ?
no --
come on .
my mother used to hum this to me . like her mother hummed it to her . and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her .
no .
then who called me ?
nell , the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here .
but you told me to look in the paper ! you told me i 'd be perfect !
nell . you will come here now .
the children want me . they 're calling me . they need me .
because that 's where he burned them up , the child laborers from his mills ! because that 's where their bones are ! he killed < i > hundreds < /i > . he took them here and he killed them . their bones are in the fireplace !
why would we want to do that , nell ?
it 's not real ? crain ? he 's not real ?
i had n't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance . mass hysteria is like a story , nell . a communal story . someone starts it . then we all add a little more to it . and then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it . this story shapes what we see and hear . we interpret everything through it , make it fit the story . i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house . you 've added to it . that 's what this experiment has all been about . that 's what it was about , the experiment 's over . i 'm pulling the plug . this is my fault .
and they 're all locked together in here ... and he wo n't let go of them !
nell ... please , nell ... take a deep breath ...
i do n't know . a lullaby i guess . my mother used to hum it to me . and her mother before that , and so on . hugh crain , would you care to dance ?
what is that tune ?
it does n't matter . even if they 're tormenting me , someone wants me . what i do with this is up to me . i can be a victim , or i can be a volunteer . and i want to be the volunteer .
i do n't know .
why ?
someone is playing with you .
sure .
you 'll never see it again . mr. dudley 's taking care of it . i 'm sorry , nell . can i show you something you 'd like to see ?
welcome home .
it was .
it was a stupid thing to do .
i do n't know .
let 's say it was n't you . who did it ?
i wish i were . i wish i had done it , then i could confess and you 'd be at peace . that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved , i wish you had an enemy , so i could beat him up .
are you coming to confess ?
no you 're not . something moved you . you saw something .
i 'm sorry . i 'm messing up the study .
hmm .
i got more scared .
and then what happened ?
yes .
like she smelled it too ?
i looked at theo . she had a look on her face .
what happened after you smelled it ?
i was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom .
so ... smell ... is ... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories . and a memory can trigger a smell .
in the bathroom in my mother 's room , the toilet was next to an old wooden table . it smelled like that wood .
all right ...
it was very specific .
what did it smell like ?
that smell ... oh , god .
nell ! what 's wrong ?
for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic . pardon me . excuse me , sorry , sorry ...
sorry .
how do you feel about luke 's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing ? water hammer , something like that ?
theo i think . you 've asked us that three times , doctor marrow . what 's going on ?
the cold sensation . who felt it first ?
but there 's a sad catch to the story .
all the carvings .
yes , because someone was always keeping me awake . ever since i was little . that was my job . i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long , and she woke up all the time . and after she died , well , it 's been a few months , but i still , i still wake up , it 's ... a habit . i know we 've only known each other a couple of hours , but i 'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this . i 'm really happy to be here with you .
you wrote that you had trouble sleeping .
well ... we 're glad to have you .
i 'm really ... honored to be part of this study , jim .
nell . good enough . and i 'm jim .
you can call me nell , dr. marrow .
eleanor , how was the drive ?
there were no children . rene died , and < u > then < /u > hugh crain built all of this , and then he died . his heart was broken .
what happened ?
yes . it 's perfect , is n't it ?
this is where we 're going ?
that ? that 's hill house .
what 's this ? what 's this ... this picture ?
good .
here 's how they 're organized . groups of five , very different personalities : scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for . and they all score high on the insomnia charts .
because it 's my phone . yes ... mrs. dudley , just leave the boxes inside , thank you . see you soon . thank you .
how 'd i know it was for you ?
yes , this is doctor marrow .
test it .
you hear the vibrations in the wire . there 's a magnetic pulse in the wires , you feel it . i could test it .
you 're going to publish , he 's going to perish ... and why did you hire me for this ?
what ?
you know what he 's really upset about ?
but the experiment was a failure .
i 'm a scientist . i just conducted an experiment . now i have to write it up .
i 'm not going back to new york city . i 'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden , where you can just see the ocean and at night , when the wind comes in just right , you can hear the sound of the harbor . what about you ?
nell , what do we do ?
oh god , we ca n't get out !
no . if he 's lost somewhere in the house ... he 'll have to stay lost until tomorrow , until the night is over . what we have to do now is be together , with nell .
he 's wandering around the house , and nell heard him . she thought it was ghosts . let 's go look for him again .
i 'll take her with me to the university tomorrow . i ca n't believe i read the test wrong . i did n't see anything that looked like she was suicidal .
she needs help .
yes . but i promised i would n't let her alone the whole night .
is she asleep ?
how could you do this to people ?
your fear of him was real . that 's all the ghost anyone needs .
it 's okay ... we 're all here ...
get a blanket !
mary came with me .
maybe they 're mary 's .
good morning , theo . luke .
well this is a cozy breakfast .
every day . basically we 'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening .
when do we take the tests ?
no , but nell 's been here longer than i have .
have either of you seen david watts ?
ca n't say . have n't been here that long . well , it 's labor day , got ta get to work .
why ?
she was unhappy .
yes .
why 'd she kill herself ?
why ?
rene crain . up there . rope . ship 's hawser . hard to tie . do n't know how she got it .
who ?
that 's where she hanged herself .
mrs. dudley 'll be waiting for you .
is there something about the house ?
that 's a good question . what is it about fences ? sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable . why would that be ?
why do you need a chain like that ?
i 'm with dr. marrow 's group . i 'm supposed to check in with mrs. dudley up at the house . is she here ?
yeah , i 'm mister dudley , the caretaker . what are you doing here ?
are you mister dudley , the caretaker ?
me ? no . what are you doing here ?
oh ! you scared me .
what do you want ?
no one will come any nearer than that .
no one could . no one lives any nearer than town .
-- no one could . no one lives any nearer than town . no one will come any nearer than that . in the night . in the dark .
why would we --
it 's a job . i keep banker 's hours . i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six . you can serve yourselves . breakfast is ready at nine . i do n't wait on people . i do n't stay after dinner . not after it begins to get dark . i leave before dark comes . we live in town . nine miles . so there wo n't be anyone around if you need help . we could n't even hear you , in the night .
well , i 've never lived with beauty . you must love working here .
i 've seen 'em . lot to dust .
they 're so beautiful . are n't they ?
so far .
mrs. dudley .
it 's make the soup or answer the door . ca n't do both .
then let 's go get you one .
oh , theo . you know i do n't have an apartment .
just had to be sure .
what 'd you come back for , babe ?
come on ! why are we waiting ?
they 're all in here . all the ones he killed . they 're just children ! we have to help them !
i do .
i do n't think i want any .
i 'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep . and then i 'm going to get some brandy .
-- but the painting !
nell , it makes sense . it all makes sense . you and i , we were scaring each other , working each other up .
this is real , i 'm not making it up ! theo , you saw it ! you were there -- the banging and last night . you , you all saw the painting !
carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed --
nell , what happened ?
because i do n't want to ruin things . because home is where the heart is .
then who is ? come on , nell . deep down , if you really thought it was n't jim , why would n't you be leaving right this second ? why would n't you be afraid ? really afraid .
-- what do you think ?
marrow said the same thing as last night , he < u > says < /u > -- -- that he checked with mrs. dudley . and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney . he says that he thinks that the flue was open , and with the windstorm , he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
okay .
i think so .
are you sure ?
i 'm trying . have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it 'd ruin things .
my place is n't like yours , nell , it does n't have a view of sea . it does n't have a view of anything . what 's interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls . living with me ... my boundaries are n't very well defined , nell . do you know what i mean ?
i do n't know , you know ...
you want to move to new york , you want to move in with me ?
i have a loft .
i 'll take that as a compliment . in the city , what kind of place do you live in ?
me too . although i learned one thing about you , that you do n't know about yourself . you can be a pretty decent bitch .
i 'm sorry i was mad at you , theo .
red . what else ?
well ?
i 've never had a pedicure before .
just think about one thing right now : what color ?
i do n't know what to think anymore .
well , it was n't me . mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he 's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and ... you said the good doctor was with you .
before he painted your name over mister crain .
there 's hundreds of them . this must be a record of the children who died at the mills , like luke said .
that 's so sad .
i do n't know . you 've been alone for a long time , maybe you want attention . maybe he did it ...
why ?
maybe you did it yourself .
theo ... did you ?
no , it 's getting worse .
is it over ?
maybe he never came in . if he 'd come in , he would have left his bags at the door , right ? or maybe he got here early , and went for a walk , and fell . maybe he 's outside .
david ?
david ? david watts ? can you hear us ? david ! daviiiiid !
david .
what 's his first name ?
watts ?
two sets . i do n't know . maybe they 're not even his .
how could he have left without his keys ?
i guess . oh , your hair ! it looks good .
yes . i feel realy rested , too . theo ?
you know it was n't a joke , theo .
if this was some sort of joke , i 'm going to kill him .
you , too . happy tossing and turning .
good night , theo .
no . the world has missed you .
yes . i 've missed it .
you 've been out of the world for a long time , have n't you ?
the taj mahal was n't a palace , it was a tomb . why did n't he tell us ?
a monster ? but he built this for the woman he loved , like the taj mahal .
you 're okay .
i love this house . i really love this house .
i know .
jeez .
i do n't have anyone . but i do have a little apartment of my own . it has a little flower garden . you can just see the ocean . at night , when the wind comes in just right , you can hear the buoys in the harbor .
a blank canvas ! i could paint your portrait , directly on you . or maybe not . so , you ? husbands ? boyfriends ? girlfriends ? where do you live ?
no .
my boyfriend thinks so , my girlfriend does n't . if we could all live together ... but ... they hate each other . it 's hard to be miss perversity when you 're the only one at the party . d'you know what i mean ?
ohh , sure , you have trouble with commitment .
do n't tell me boston is different from new york .
not really .
that depends .
i 'm between jobs right now . my last job ... it ... the person i was working for ... the job ended . over . so ... and you ?
what do you do ?
that 's why we 're here .
do n't worry , i probably wo n't be in here much . light sleeper .
i do n't know what you mean .
wait . you 're not wearing that ironically ? this is really you ?
it 's all i could afford .
that 'd be seventy in new york . you stole it !
fifteen dollars .
what did it cost ?
this ? it 's from a thrift shop .
and what you 're wearing , that 's great , too .
because --
why not ?
no .
we ca n't find ... ... two of our guys .
we think ?
we think someone is here .
i sure hope so .
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time .
the freeway 's faster , but lacks a certain majesty .
nothing . i guess it 's hard to pass on this road .
what 's the matter ?
all your life . that happened while i swam the length of my pool .
i 've lived in l.a. all my life , i 've never done this drive .
i 'm a gracious host .
hey , i thought you were n't a buffet person .
it must 've been a time . a golden moment .
we all did .
i like the colors .
sure .
not who , food . should we get italian .
who ?
italian .
i 'm sorry .
italian ?
oh , god .
that 's what gordon 's always saying .
for some , eating is a sensual experience . < u > the < /u > sensual experience .
it 's just fuel to me . i 'm not there for distractions .
you demand to be served . a fork fetishist .
i do n't like do-it-yourself cuisine . buffets . salad bars .
like you .
i 'm not into finger foods . too fussy .
why ?
anything but japanese .
what kind of food ?
as soon as you get dressed .
it 's an observation . like : i 'm hungry . when are we eating ?
it 's not a compliment .
it 's not a knock .
i 'm so glad we 're having this chat .
no . you 're not specific enough to be a person . you 're more like a vibe .
i 'm not .
well , you 're certainly not a person .
am i a thing ?
i 'm loyal to things that make me happy .
not for you , clearly .
is that a problem ?
is it possible that you 're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty ?
then what good is he ?
gordon ? he 's been with me for years . he 's not as tough as he looks .
i < u > want < /u > to know why you < u > need < /u > that scary guy in your house .
is there anything in the world that you want or need ?
could be worse , he could 've named you reticulum .
i used to hate it . now i like it .
adhara . i told your father , if you 're looking for a name , you ca n't go wrong with a constellation .
that 's why i 'm letting you take care of this . i 'm the one with appearances to maintain . but who gives a shit about you ? not even god .
fuck you , mr. whatever-your-name is . this is a lifestyle i embrace .
see , a successful man like me has limitations -- i lose touch at a street level . so i have to depend on a smart boy like you who 's closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am .
this is un-fucking professional .
i 'll point you in the right direction , but you 'll have to take it to the end- zone . he 's a hit-and-run gunman -- i figure he 's not cruising the polo lounge .
what shit is this . i just do it . i do n't prepare it .
when you find the guy , you 'll know .
where do we go ?
same as last time -- the rest after .
okay .
how 'd you like to kill someone for me ?
not bad .
how they goin ' , kid ?
come over here .
hey .
well , can we make it one more . nowhere the fuck near me .
there 's already gon na be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons .
you think i 'm staying ?
you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here .
no . i mean . not even your people should be involved . right ? it 's too close now .
we 'll find him .
where do < u > you < /u > think he is , mike .
i do n't know everyone here . he was so traumatized he split . maybe he was gordon 's < u > pusher < /u > .
and where is this guest ? do n't they want to interview him .
as it happens . i did n't make that part up .
heavier than that now . but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story .
i mean , gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds .
what did you tell them .
why , because you 're my security consultant ? this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down .
you should have let me do the talking .
well , either they have a very liberal work-release program , or he 's out , because he 's here in l.a. , looking for you .
i thought he was in prison , in england .
no , terry . they do n't work like that . jenny wilson 's father paid a little visit , left a message .
our black friends ?
what the papers used to call a `` gangland slaying . ''
what kind ?
there 's been some trouble downtown .
what .
i saw your mother on the strip last night . she went up to three guys , said she 'd like 'em to stick one in each , know what i mean ?
huh ?
i would n't talk .
fuck you .
let him break - he likes to break .
you broke last time .
no problem . if < u > you < /u > do n't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen .
yeah ?
i can take care of the paperwork .
packs a punch , but it 's compact , has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece .
been to the boat show .
you 're in gun country now , my friend .
just luck , this , really . never been to one of these before .
you came to the right place , sir . my wife 's second cousin is english . well , scotch-irish . can i interest you in a holster ?
england . only , we saw there was a show on , thought i might pick something up for a price , type of thing .
oh really ? where you from ?
close quarters combat . keep one in my own home .
cq what ?
yes , sir . wo n't find a better cqc on the market .
what 'd you call that -- the protector ?
that 's a high-end item . total reliability .
lookin ' good .
man knows what he likes .
the lot . the whole british bloody post office . i had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius , it was . could i get anybody interested ? no -- they 're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman . lazy sods . jumble sale on in watford , they 'll be up at the crack of dawn .
what post office ?
useless gits . i was gon na do the post office once .
yeah , i suppose . call 'em that , yeah . down the boozer saturday night . meet some of the lads .
do you have any friends , man ?
again ?
i 've been wondering something .
you think a fuckin ' guy like that ever will ? what more do you want , man ?
he 's got ta know why .
too easy ?
that would be too easy .
why did n't you just kill him , you had the chance .
you steady on , man . what the fuck else did you do back there .
steady on .
one thing i need .
you goin ' back inside ?
bring the motor around . bang out in front , right ?
faith .
what are we standing on ?
first in , first out , that 's me .
no one else is even here yet .
well , that 's what we 're doin ' , n ' it .
i thought you just wanted to check out the house , man .
valets , eh ? are n't we all la-de-da .
< u > valets < /u > . they park cars . he 's having a party .
valets . what d'ya mean valets . what is he , then , the earl of fucking doncaster ?
those are n't guards . they 're valets .
what 's so fucking funny ?
see what i mean ? wearing bloomin ' uniforms n ' all .
that was one of them ?
they look a right load of wallies . patrolling back and forth outside the gate , all ponced up like the fuckin ' household cavalry . watch it .
has he ?
extra muscle . bodyguards .
what ?
he 's brought in the heavy mob .
huh ?
butcher 's hook . look . i do n't much reckon those minders of his .
who 'd you butcher at the house ?
gate 's open . i had a butcher 's at the house .
told you you would n't be able to see through that gate .
oh , jenny was in my acting class .
how 'd the two of you hook up , then ?
no , no -- jenny used to work as a waitress . before she met him . but that 's not where she met me . not in my restaurant .
and that 's where you met jenny .
he came in with jenny to the restaurant where i work . that 's not where they met .
hang about . i thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with jenny .
jenny told me she met him at the beach . got blinded by his smile . you believe that shit ? son of a bitch never smiled at me . buried her at a `` private '' service . private for who . him ?
well , there you are . jen must 've liked him .
five years , i think . long time .
it 's only insurance . ca n't be too careful . this terry valentine , he 's probably a wonderful fella . they were together how long ?
now what . you gon na take your new arsenal , go visit terry valentine , just like that ? boom bam boom .
fucking out of order , that . should n't be allowed .
you hadda show up on a weekend . this weekend . wouldn't 've even been a gun show ... for another month .
i mean , it 's already a steal , n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one ?
not me , man .
no . not at all . do we ?
do n't have time for a lot of paperwork , y'know . just popped over on a quick visit .
he do n't have a concealed weapons permit .
travelling on a dodgy passport , n ' all .
probation ? man , you crazy . they shouldn't 've let you outta your country , much less prison .
sod that . got ta get back before my probation officer wonders where i 've skived off to .
are you a resident of california ? you gon na fill out forms , man ? do the background check ? go through a three-day waiting period ?
thought perhaps there 'd be dispensing machines , you know . bung in your coins , come out with a .44 magnum , fully-loaded .
these are not guys you can just go run a number on , man .
what do i do , then , look in the bleedin ' yellow pages ?
you 're kiddin ' me , right ?
but that 's not me anymore . that 's when i was into the gang lifestyle . that 's not who i am now . five years in the joint -- that 's it for me , man .
nick 's a nick , n ' it ? no matter what state you 're in . state of remorse , most likely -- for gettin ' caught .
i already told you , man . corcoran . know what that is ? state prison .
i think you did n't get that lot in the navy , doing your national service .
not me , man . i 'm no drug dealer , what you think .
who 'd jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever ?
she did n't know what to say . i thought someone should say something . to someone . with me it was , i do n't know -- jenny liked me for some reason . i felt like i owed her .
she did n't write to me , did she .
you should talk to elaine . that was her best friend .
those streets up in the hills , man . got ta be real careful , keep your eye on the ball . two o'clock in the morning , it 's dark , your mind is all agitated , you 're drivin ' a little too fast ... those curves do n't kid around .
nah , coppers do n't do nothing , do they .
what you gon na do , man ? you gon na go to the cops ?
valentine was n't even there . if he was into something , if she was involved -- who can say . but i 'll tell you something . she stood in front of these dudes , man . eyeballing < u > them < /u > . checking < u > them < /u > out . i felt like she was covering < u > my < /u > ass that day .
did jenny know ?
bad place , man . bad people . some guys loading some trucks . some kinda deal goin ' down . i do n't know and i do n't care . maybe they 're shipping fava beans to eskimos .
where abouts ?
that 's what i thought , man . but it was not a hotel or nothin ' that we went to . it was someplace else .
what , tryin ' to catch him with another bird ?
i only asked .
i go to work , try to keep my life together , put all that shit behind me , man . what d'you want from me .
you kiddin ' , man ? i do n't need a wife and screamin ' kids . i still got my youth .
this ai n't your lot ?
i knew when i was droppin ' that letter into the mail slot it was gon na come back and smack me in the face . i did my time , okay ? my sister , her ol ' man 's up in chino right now doin ' eight years .
y'what ?
boomerang .
i dunno ... maybe they do .
no , not my girl . self-control , she had . point of pride . and people do n't change , do they .
coulda happened to anyone , man . i never knew her to be reckless . i mean , sure , she would smoke a little grass , or something , have a few drinks . but that 's it , nothing more than that .
i 'm just sayin ' -- it was a steep hillside . there was no moon that night ...
what more is there .
i dunno . what 's he gon na say ? they had a fight that night , she drove away , she was upset ? i do n't even know the guy . do n't get me wrong , jenny and me were friends , but we did n't travel in the same social circles . she had her life , i had mine .
valentine . what 's he got to say for himself ?
terry valentine .
this bloke she was bunked up with . this terry what'sit .
no , but between the lines , eh ? mysterious circumstances , and that .
i never said nothin ' about nothin ' like that . no , no , no . that 's not what i wrote to you .
snuffed her .
huh ?
who done it , then ?
it was better than a telegram .
i did n't even know who i was writing to -- just someone with the same last name . she never talked about any family .
round about , yeah .
i mean , what has it been -- six months ?
no reason .
i did n't expect anyone .
you 're home , then .
eduardo . rama .
edward rama ?
i 'd rather be with him than without him . i do n't want to be found dead in l.a .
i thought maybe you just came for the ride .
hard to miss .
... reminds me of jennifer .
no , but i know what he means .
hey , elaine . you even know what he 's saying half the time ?
hell , no . i started writing .
you just cooking then ?
not no more , they ai n't . i quit that acting shit , man .
well , those are the breaks .
did n't get it .
really .
i was gon na be in that michael mann movie , you know -- with pacino and deniro . got three callbacks .
probably .
last time i saw you , were n't you up for some equity-waiver thing ?
uh-huh .
same .
not much -- you ?
what d'you say , elaine ?
too bleeding true , 'n ' it .
you 're just on a higher plane , wilson .
poor baby .
you ca n't count on very many people , that 's the trouble . number of times a decent job 's been cocked up ...
friends and < u > colleagues < /u > .
bloke told me .
how do you know ?
that 's where valentine 's scarpered .
what 's in big sur ?
never thought of that . busman 's holiday .
i could use a vacation . of course , i keep forgetting , for you this < u > is < /u > a vacation .
fancy it ?
i do n't know -- few hours , i guess .
how far ?
up the coast .
where 's big sur ?
i know that . but as time went on ... well , it < u > was n't < /u > a joke , was it ? she had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long i 'd get the hook for . said she would n't be there this time when i got out .
she never would have turned you in , not in a million years .
she used to tell me she 'd turn me in . little kid . ten year old . `` if you 're naughty , dad , i 'll tell on ya . '' she did n't want me sent down again , see . when i was planning some job . `` i 'll tell 'em , dad , i promise i will . here , look , i 'm calling the old bill right now '' -- picking up the telephone . i can see her , the phone in her hand . became a sort of joke between us . only it was n't a joke .
still , you could never ... do what she wanted .
well , she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy was n't in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago in a worldwide tour of othello .
she told me you were a ghost in her life . daddy the friendly ghost . coming back to haunt her .
last time might as well 've been the first . i remember all the times , do n't i. watching her grow up -- in increments .
i fiddle it . they got me down as an immigrant with five kids .
a leech on the welfare state in addition . you do n't miss a trick .
i got a steady income -- i 'm on the dole .
do us a favor . ca n't even go have a slash without 'em saying , what 're you going in there for ?
minor officials bother you , do n't they ?
good luck to him . he could n't find his prick if he did n't wear y-fronts .
wo n't he be looking for you about now ?
you sound like my fucking probation officer .
i guess you 're just habitual .
black market during the war .
what 'd your father do ?
dropped dead in the stalls in the odeon , muswell hill . watching doris day .
he alive to see this ?
nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop . crafty old sod .
what about your grandmother ?
not that i recall .
stick with me , kid . looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes .
i 've got the hang of the driving . found this place all right .
yeah , well , you 're here now -- -- where < u > h < /u > urricanes < u > h < /u > ardly ever < u > h < /u > appen .
i 've 'ardly ever left it .
only in the movies .
you ever been to london ?
-- they want southern , i do southern , they want midwest , i do midwest , they want tall , blonde , and twenty-two , i 'm shit out of luck . one thing i ca n't do is english . americans ca n't . should n't even try . and laurence olivier could n't do us .
pushing the legal limit even then .
honest . did n't know where to look till i was 21 .
i do n't believe it .
it 's true . has to be said . i got off to a slow start .
you < u > have < /u > been away . or is all this just new to you ?
just now ? overnight ?
overnight . what about just now ?
get seven years , did you ?
who remembers .
did you . what was that in aid of ?
i was inside once . i punched a cop at a demo .
i 'll tell ya something : it made me a model prisoner . put me right off any escape attempts . tunnel my way to freedom after that experience ? not bloody likely .
from pursuing your chosen profession .
hey ?
it did n't discourage you , though .
we were < u > lucky < /u > to be nicked . me and the lads went down there sunday evening , we were n't discovered till the monday . good job we were still breathing .
you mean if they 'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess .
a jeweller 's up the west end . we tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road . filthy work . trouble was , the bloody thing collapsed -- < u > after < /u > we 'd made the grab , 'n all . would you adam n ' eve it .
what did you do ? to make them take the early 70 's away from you .
i can see the attraction .
still , there have been rewards . it 's sunny . and some of the producers who call even have credits .
oh , i was gon na say ...
it 's too involved ; a lifetime of non- involvement . anywhere else i 'd be an interesting little number , here i 'm just sag number forty-eight thousand and one . sag meaning screen actor 's guild .
tell us about it .
you do n't know how i 've compromised my standards .
you do n't seem bothered .
these more highlights from the zagat prison guide ?
early 70 's . i was away . maidstone . possibly brixton .
this town 's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as `` the early 70 's . '' christ , my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me .
and how did you get it ?
you think terry gave me access to her things ? probably sold her clothes .
how did you come to have my address ? found it , did you . among her things .
she 'd never called me like that before . she sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid . but she never turned up . i called the house but only got the answer machine . when they found her ... she 'd been going the wrong way . not the direction she 'd have gone if she 'd been coming to see me . or coming < u > straight < /u > to see me . who knows . maybe she just wanted to drive .
she told you all about my details but not about his . lovely .
jenny was supposed to come to my place that night . she called me , asked if she could come over . she and terry had been -- having some trouble . lately . i do n't know about what . on this occasion , it reached some sort of crisis point .
there 's the phone . you want his number .
i 'll bloody well ask him .
on what . what makes you so certain .
depends , don ' it .
terry 's never going to give you satisfaction . not the type .
what do you think .
you do n't believe it was a car accident .
what 'd you want me to do . stay at home , twiddlin ' me thumbs . doing sweet f.a . [ fuck all ] .
you fuckin ' guys and your dicks .
have you ever known me not to be .
are you serious .
why not .
so what 's the deal . you and terry valentine at twenty paces . is that what this is about .
-- when he wants someone run down , you 're willing to do it for him .
this and that . y'know . ways and means .
in what capacity are you employed by this mr. lindgren ?
anyhow , he 's always saying to me , dave , never run yourself down , son -- 'cause there 'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you .
right .
well , not to say mr. lindgren is dishonest , exactly .
i thought you said you never did an honest day 's work in your life .
various enterprises , style of thing .
i bet .
based in london , but with international concerns .
i see .
proprietor of a london firm . of longstanding .
what line is he in .
my employer .
who 's mr. lindgren ?
-- mr. lindgren .
-- your employer ?
now , you should n't run yourself down . my employer , mr. lindgren --
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing . like me -- but on a grander scale of failure .
well , i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me . some sort of pop music producer , was n't it .
do you even know who terry valentine is ?
eight hours difference between here and london . would 've been , what , ten in the morning , my time . i was just coming out on the yard . now , i was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then . bit of fresh air , stretch me legs -- well , stretch the day out , really , that 's what you wan na do . and i 'll tell ya : i could n't open the paper . could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together . that 's how weak my hands went . thought i was having heart attack , only i knew i was n't . bloke come up to me , he says , dave , he says , you 've gone all white . i said , fuck me , i 've been in prison half my life , what d'ya expect . but he was dead on , 'cause i could feel the blood drain right out of me head . and i knew ... something had happened to jen .
that 's what was estimated .
i already knew . knew beforehand . when was it supposed to have happened ? -- two o'clock in the morning , eddie said .
where you get your bank statements .
something like that , yeah .
what 's that , like a p.o . box .
nah , accommodation address .
the address jenny gave me , that was n't a prison , was it ?
nah , we split up when jenny was six . her second husband done a runner after she got sick . they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital . we were always mates , me and jenny 's mum . i like to think they 're together again now . y'know . heavenly choir .
were you still married at the time -- to jenny 's mother , i mean ?
well , do n't suppose she did , really , most of her life . on her own after her mum died . aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned .
i gave him yours . said , here , you want to write , i think this is a relative . i guess i thought i was being true to jenny . who told me she did n't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why .
he give me your address .
i should really give him a call . he 's a character , is n't he . well , not to you . i meant to us squares in the outside world .
yeah , saw eddie , yeah . me and him are muckers .
and you 've seen eddie rama .
well , i reckoned , saturday night , if you were goin ' out , you 'd probably have to come home first .
i might 've been away for the weekend .
no , i had -- some other matters to attend to , you know . getting a car sorted ...
you have n't been lurking outside my building all day .
yesterday . afternoon .
when did you get in ?
she was happy here . however the two of you might have parted . do n't think she was n't .
footloose and fancy free .
she was twenty-one when she came to me . ... straight from leaving you .
in jenny ? 'course not . how could i be . 'course i was n't .
you were n't disappointed in her , then .
learnin ' 'ow to speak proper . central school of speech and drama . it 's no doddle gettin ' in there , y'know . at seventeen . they offered her a place at rada n ' all , only she'd 've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on , was jenny . she could talk posh without any training , when she was knee-high to a grasshopper . show up the old man , you know .
modelling .
yeah , well , she started all that in london .
when i 'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach . not that her accent would have hobbled her progress . not with that look .
how 'd you manage that , then .
she never told anyone else . about the convict strain -- or is it stain ? no , i was privileged . i was someone who helped jenny efface her past .
she never told eddie , though .
disappointed .
not ashamed .
ashamed .
not embarrassed .
i ca n't believe jenny told you all that . about me . she was always so embarrassed .
i 'm sorry . i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went . it must 've been the bars .
when you 've lost as many years as i have , love , puts things in perspective , know what i mean .
now who 's being sarcastic ?
oh , it just ended , then .
three seasons . they found that 's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail . i was wife number three -- the ingenue .
said it went on for donkey 's years .
if it played in england somebody owes me money . who told you that -- eddie ?
were n't you on a television series ?
sarcastic , moi ? maybe i 'll mellow when my ship comes in . it 's expected any day now . i 'm all packed and ready to go .
here , are you always this sarky ?
sounds like beverly hills .
... no , i went in for more improving pastimes . philosophy classes , language courses , european history , all that lark . did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in people 's houses than there were people in people 's houses .
try calling me again .
here , are n't you gon na let me in .
well , that kind of security ca n't be bought . must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you .
hardly buried . earning interest , love . earning interest in an offshore account . tidy little premium per annum , that .
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out . from the wembley staduim job , was n't it ? pink floyd concert receipts . jenny would 've been ... fourteen at the time ?
sewing mailbags ? me ? never did an honest day 's work in my life , dear . was n't about to start when i was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands .
in any case , i do n't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel .
it was the bars , then .
i heard you were -- what 's that adorable phrase ? -- `` at her majesty 's pleasure . ''
what was that , then ?
that 's not what i heard .
i was skint -- did n't have no money to get here .
it 's been a while .
how d'you mean ?
been busy , have you .
sort a few things out .
no , why did you come here ?
wanted to talk to you , did n't i ?
why did you come here ?
she used to pinch 'em off me . funny that . one thing she never tried to get me to stop .
not her brand .
perhaps it was the smoke .
you look alike .
had a feeling it was you .
what am i doing ?
and that is ?
in which case i 'll just do what i usually do .
as you prefer , squire . as you prefer .
but if you 're mad at him too and he 's mad at you ... that must make us pals .
oh , yeah , right . the deal .
of the deal , man .
all of what ?
he 'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut . did n't think he 'd be so bold as to take all of it .
no , i can reassure you on that point . valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you .
because that was n't anything to do with me . and suspicion has been cast in my direction . did n't make any sense . choosing those shitheads over me , cutting me out of the deal , then screwing them over too .
eh ?
it was you . downtown .
nothing financial . strictly personal . i can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where i 'm concerned . a foreigner , showing up unexpectedly , like .
so what 's your beef , pal ?
yeah . should n't wonder . must 've done .
that dude who works for valentine . he 's the one sent those guys after you . you know that .
good job your lot showed up when they did or it would 've been < u > me < /u > for the high jump .
yeah , i guess you are .
your guess is as good as mine , mate . i 'm here on another matter entirely .
but i ca n't be sure . i do n't even know who he is . he 's too insulated . too many layers around him .
i can well believe it . i 'm sure he has done , son . he 's about as straight as a dog 's hind leg .
well , i 'll tell you . i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money .
look , mush , you 're the guv'nor here , i can see that , i 'm on your manor now , right . so there 's no need to get out of your pram . i 'm johnny-come-lately to all this . whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine , it 's got nothing to do with me . i do n't wan na know .
there 's one thing i do n't understand . the thing i do n't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you 're saying .
he had urgent business in the north .
where is he now ?
he 's always been very forward-thinking . he invested wisely .
so you would n't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money .
my client is an entrepreneur . i am his lawyer , not his business manager .
your client have a deal in long beach ? how about downtown ? there 's some folks there -- oh , wait , they 're all dead . any of this ring a bell ?
deals ? my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment . you 'd have to be more specific .
a < u > statement < /u > ? i would n't mind getting a statement . you see , < u > my < /u > client -- the united states government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client .
my client has already given a statement regarding yesterday 's events .
valentine had himself a party , i hear .
yeah . cheers , mate .
yeah . i really admire the guy . well . good to meet you .
right . chain of respect . that 's good , that .
what i like about ian , he believes in a chain of command , but not a chain of respect , you understand what i 'm saying ?
no kidding .
turned that place completely around . 180 degrees .
yeah ?
that 's too bad . ian 's got a good thing going over there .
unless i 'm not who i think i am .
you sure ?
sorry . was n't me .
i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london .
ian ?
do n't you work with ian ?
yeah .
the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders .
but first i got ta give these lads a talking to , these geezers what sent me up the river , in a manner of speaking .
could do , yeah .
sounds like you need a rest .
i had to , did n't i. nothing else for it . then just when i 'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop , i had to bugger off to the states .
but you stuck it out , anyway , all that time .
well , time off for good behavior , you know . i should n't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place . i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for . i do n't mind pulling me own cart , but not someone else 's , know what i mean .
nine years ? is that legal ?
out on a oil rig . in the north sea . nine years .
where else ?
been away a lot .
no rest for the wicked .
yeah . another little matter needs attending to soon as i return .
you 'll be looking forward to getting back , then .
you 're a reluctant traveller , then .
i would have preferred staying home , me .
i can never decide what i like better . leaving home , or coming back .
yeah , that 's right .
while they 're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in .
how we gon na get that lucky ?
drugs ? cash ? both if we 're lucky .
what 's in it ?
i do n't know who that english guy is . some kind of -- -- courier or something . maybe a seller . maybe a buyer . but mr. < u > avery < /u > wanted him , those jigs wanted him -- and i betcha there 's a briefcase somewhere .
i do n't get it .
`` he ai n't wrong . '' listen , i know this asshole who < u > did < /u > just go to work for him . full-time . and this dickhead 's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast . < u > that 's < /u > the type of individual gets hired , someone who 'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job .
well , we blew it , did n't we ? he ai n't wrong .
like he 'd never hire me for real . not week-to-week . i do n't have the credentials . he thinks i 'm just a sociopath , someone he can turn to when he needs `` plausible denial . ''
like what .
you bet .
you do ?
i happen to know more about mr. whatever- his-name-is than he thinks i know about him and his operation .
what ?
something 's on .
there is ?
there 's more than a measly few grand in this .
we coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand .
lem me break .
straight rotation , no shit , call your shot .
any happier than any other asshole in life .
what d'you mean , any happier ?
and i said so what . you think she 's any happier ?
i dunno . i just said she 's nice lookin ' .
so what .
she 's nice lookin ' .
that do n't mean nothin ' .
avery said she was tight with his daughter .
maybe she does n't even know the english guy .
the l.a.p.d .
i do n't know .
two blacks and a mexican in a car . who 's driving ?
why do n't they have tv shows about people whose daily lives you 'd be interested in watching . y'know . like skinny little weakling . or big fat guy . sick old man . family of losers . would n't that be good ?
looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth .
kinda makes you wonder why more people do n't put a bullet through their fuckin ' skulls , does n't it .
... you can always tell the ones who 'll do anal .
very attractive . good idea . now i < u > really < /u > want to fuck you .
jesus , are you gay enough or what .
good luck .
ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores ? wow .
the forever kind .
which kind ?
yeah .
makin ' trouble for someone ?
i got half .
hey .
five thousand .
how much .
listen , get the fuck out of here before you get hurt . who the fuck do you think you are , waltzing in here , asking questions ?
where is he , then ?
what do you think ?
is valentine here ?
yeah . i know her , all right . she came down here once , stirred up a shitstorm . we lost a full day 's work , took me weeks to get back on schedule . if she had n't a ' been terry 's woman i would 've broke her jaw . 'course , she 's nobody 's problem now .
you know her ?
jennifer wilson .
i have a message for him . about jennifer wilson .
so why would he want to see you .
i doubt it .
he 's expecting you ?
looking for a bloke named valentine . know him ?
you walked . what the hell are you doing here .
walked .
how 'd you get in here .
that 's right , your life is shit , and i 'm to blame . it 's that simple .
it 's been five minutes and i 'm packing to leave again . i ca n't believe this .
go now .
who 's looking for you ?
in a couple of days this whole thing --
are you finished ?
go to him . go to his studio , or writers workshop or artists colony , esselin retreat , nudist camp --
you know i do n't live with him .
is he here ?
-- you know his name is frank .
where 's ... what's-his-name -- fred --
susan .
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway .
no trouble .
what kind of trouble are you in ?
sure you do .
i do n't want you here , terry .
you 've made it ... brighter .
they 're at college . or does n't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore .
i miss my kids .
since when ?
exercising my visitation rights .
what are you doing here ?
hello there .
< u > why < /u > then . why did you do it !
she could 've had the deal ! i would 've handed it to her if she wanted . i would have given her everything .
about jenny . tell me about jenny . about the < u > deal < /u > . whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it , you bastard .
tell you ...
tell me .
what .
be seein ' you .
thanks . you , too .
oh , i think a shake-up was in order . definitely . otherwise , people get lazy , do n't they ? forgetful . start thinking they can get away with things . got ta shake 'em up now and again , make 'em pay attention .
i suppose that 's good , unless things were fine the way they were .
great bloke . really turned things around there . 180 degrees .
i do n't .
you must know ian .
ah .
emi in london . i work with ian .
have we met ? there 's something i ca n't quite --
pleasure .
sometimes knowledge is a curse , ed . after this happened , things changed . big dave ... he never touched me again .
ann , will you come in , sit down , maybe have a drink ?
the government knows . i can not repeat it to you . but this thing goes deep , ed . this was not your wife . i goes deep , and involves the government . there is a great deal of fear . you know how certain circles would find it -- the knowledge -- a threat . they try to limit it , and --
ann --
a spacecraft . i saw the creatures . they led big dave onto the craft . he never told anyone what they did , outside of his report . of course he told *me* . no one else .
ann --
at night , there were lights -- we both saw them . we never told anyone , outside of our official report .
... yes ?
we went camping last summer . in eugene , oregon . *outside* of eugene , ed .
yes ?
and you should tell doris ...
yes , ann ?
oh , i know . do n't worry , ed . i came to tell you ...
of course , you know , doris had nothing to do with it . nothing at all .
yes . thank you .
... i 'm so sorry about your loss .
ann . will you come in ?
hello , ed .
please , mr crane , it 's ok , please --
... no , please .
it 's ok ...
birdy --
... i wanted to make you happy .
but i do appreciate it , mr crane ...
... i guess i 've been all wet .
huh . yeah . maybe ...
you 're an enthusiast .
huh .
i 'm only sorry that i did n't play better for you . i know it would 've made you happy . you know what you are ?
ah ... it 's nothing .
i do appreciate the interest you 've taken , though .
... uh-huh .
... i 'm not certain i 'll have a career at all , and if i do , i 'll probably be a veterinarian .
but it does n't matter . really , i 'm not interested in playing music professionally .
i 'm sure there 's a dozen teachers better than this clown . more qualified . goddamn phony .
it does n't matter , mr crane .
look , i 'm no expert , but --
but more or less .
he did n't say that .
... i stank , did n't i ?
just see him , as a favor to me .
geez , mr crane .
i know you have n't . look , just go meet him as a favor to me . i talked to this guy . hope i pronounced his name right . he sounded very busy , but he 's not a bad egg ; he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are . he agreed to see you this saturday . he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough . his words .
geez , mr crane , i do n't know . i had n't really thought about a career or stuff .
i have to do it . i ca n't stand by and watch more things go down the drain . you 're young , you do n't understand .
oh , mr crane --
you 've got talent , anyone could see that . and he 's the best . if he thinks a student has talent , he 'll take 'em on for next to nothing . you 're a cinch to be accepted , i could cover the cost of the lessons , like i said , it 's pretty modest --
boy .
that 's swell . however , the music , if you want to pursue it , well , the lessons from mrs swan , they 'll only take you so far . there 's this guy in san francisco , i 've made inquiries , everybody says he 's the best . trained lots of people who 've gone on to have big concert careers , symphony orchestras , the works . his name is jacques carcanogues . i 'm not sure i 'm pronouncing it right . anyway , he 's a frenchman .
well , sure , i guess . pop says so too . i work pretty hard at school .
anyway , uh ... my point is you 're young . a kid really , your whole life ahead of you . but it 's not too soon to start thinking ... to start making opportunities for yourself . before it all washes away .
that 's what he keeps telling me .
sure ... sure , it 's his house .
pop does n't like people smoking in here .
... or maybe i just have n't played 'em right , i do n't know . but you 're --
birdy , i 've been doing a lot of thinking . there are a lot of things that have n't worked out for me . life has dealt me some bum cards ...
we 've certainly missed you .
yeah .
we have n't seen you since ... i 'm terribly sorry .
hello , birdy .
hello , mr crane .
hello , tony .
oh , in there ? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo . i guess , if nobody noticed , it 's ok. mr crane , this is tony , a friend of mine . tony , mr crane .
hello , birdy . i thought that was very good .
hi , mr crane .
beethoven . he created it , and yet he never actually heard it . i suppose he heard it all in his head , somehow .
who ?
he was deaf when he wrote this .
yeah . thanks .
i 'm so sorry ... i was sorry to hear .
hello , rachel .
it 's ok , i guess . no , i do n't really . i 'm not big on music , ordinarily .
... you do n't like the music out there ?
then you listen to me , for i am expert . that girl , she give me a headache . she can not play . nice girl . very clever hands . nice girl . someday , i think , maybe , she make a very good typist .
well , look , i do n't claim to be an expert --
... she can go up there .
ah , but that is just what i can not teach . i can not teach her to have a soul . look , monsieur , play the piano , is not about the fingers . *done* with the fingers , yes . but the music , she is inside . inside , monsieur ...
i do n't understand , no mistakes , she 's just a kid -- i thought you taught the , uh , the --
mistake , no , it says e-flat , she plays e-flat . ping-ping . hit the right note , always . very proper .
did she make mistakes ?
is not so hard to understand . her playing , very polite .
i do n't understand .
ze girl ? ... she seems like a very nice girl . she *plays* , monsieur , like a very nice girl . ztinks . very nice girl . however , ztinks .
well ? how 'd she do ?
... mm .
ah .
well , i do n't pretend to be an expert .
ah yes , a music lover .
uh-huh .
i speak to you on ze phone , non ? you have a special interest in music ?
no . uh ... family friend .
... you are ze fahzer ?
ok .
and i 've never been asked -- look , you want the dough back ? you know who i am ! you --
all right .
*screw* you -- jesus ! take it to a lawyer ! no , i insist ! this is *dry* cleaning , this is not some fly-by- night thing here ! i must say , i 've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and i 've never --
... you 're not gon na screw me on this ?
look , uh ... creighton ...
well , there it is . writ large in legal escriture , next step is --
uh-huh .
... yeah , that 's it . as per our discussion .
yeah , good . lem me just , uh ...
that 'll be fine .
... just a second here , i 'll give you a receipt on the , uh ... whoa , nellie ... oh , by the way , we did n't talk about this , i , uh , i think i 'm gon na call the place tolliver 's , after me , you know , i did n't think you were much interested in , uh --
yeah , screw 'em , huh ? pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it , what 's the point ?
it 's ok .
pretty straightforward , but i do n't know if you wan na show this stuff to a lawyer --
yeah .
i got the paperwork here . partnership papers here , they reflect our agreement : fifty-fifty on the net , i supply professional services , you supply the capital . i 'll give you a receipt on the dough there , huh ?
sure .
... usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft . but cash -- that 's fine -- it 's all the same in the end -- dough 's dough , huh ?
cash ? !
cash .
... you bring a check ?
yeah .
right ! strictly business .
way out of line .
no problem !
you 're out of line , mister .
maybe .
... was that a pass ?
ed .
... it just goes to show , when one door slams shut , another one opens . here 's to ya , uh ...
well , i 'll be damned . the barber ! and i thought this trip was a bust . well ...
i 'll have it in a week .
fifty-fifty , straight down the line . you and me . finance and expertise . so -- you 've got the dough then , do ya ?
and how do we share --
do ? hell , nothing . well , you 'll want to keep tabs on your investment , of course , but i 'm looking for a silent partner . i 've done the research , i 've contacted the vendors , the deal is set . i 'm just looking for venture capital , friend . disappear if you want , check in whenever you like -- i want the dough ; i do n't take attendance .
what 's involved , aside from putting up the money ? what 're you looking for the partner to do ?
sure .
no . i -- tell me --
come in , come in , siddown over there . coffee ?
i can get it , yeah .
you got the dough ? !
no . i might be interested in that , uh , business proposition --
... i did n't recognize you without the smock . did i -- damn -- did i leave something at the shop ?
jesus ! the barber ! i 'll be a sonofagun . why did n't you say so ? 'course -- the barber .
i 'm , uh , i 'm -- the barber .
sorry , friend , i , uh , you got me at a disadvantage .
... ed crane . remember ? today ?
that 's right ! dry cleaning -- remember the name . it 's going to revolutionize the laundry industry , and those that get in early are gon na bear the fruit away . all i need is $ 10,000 to open my first store , then i use its cash flow to finance another , and so on -- leap frog , bootstrap myself a whole chain . well , me and a partner . cleanliness , friend . there 's money in it . there 's a future . there 's room to grow ... say , that 's looking pretty good . let 's see it with the hairpiece on ...
huh .
it 's called dry cleaning . you heard me right , brother , 'dry cleaning ' -- wash without water , no suds , no tumble , no stress on the clothes . it 's all done with chemicals , friend , and your garments end up crisp and fresh . and here 's the capper : no shrinkage .
that right .
well , it 's the wildest goose there is . risk money . very speculative . except , ed , in certain situations , it 's not , see ? i thought i had a prospect here . well , i make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed -- all his capital 's gon na be tied up in expansion plans of his own . thank you , mother ! pop goes another bubble ! it 's only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i ca n't seem to interest a soul !
uh --
a goose , friend . i was chasing a wild goose . ed , have you ever heard of venture capital ?
i 'm not proud of what i did . but *you* .
i , uh ...
i 'd understand if you 'd walked in here . socked me in the nose . whatever . i deserved it .
big dave --
what kind of man *are* you ?
... huh ?
... what kind of man *are* you ?
so you paid the guy ?
... it ruined me . this money . no annex . i 'm all shot to hell .
come on in .
... dave ?
ok .
i 'm at nirdlinger 's . let yourself in .
your place ?
please , ed .
but it 's ...
please , ed .
embezzling , ed . from my own goddamn wife !
mm .
that 's my capitalization on the annex ! *my* operation , ed ! christ almighty . that 's what i was just talking to doris about , a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann .
... why do n't you just pay him , dave ?
... oh , jesus .
he 's staying at the hotel i 've gone to with , uh , with the lady in question . must 've seen us .
mm . how , uh ... how did he know that --
well , i guess he do n't care that it 's obvious .
would he ... it sounds pretty obvious .
the sonofabitch . the blackmailer . it 's , uh , it 's no one you know . it 's a businessman from sacramento . a goddamn pansy , ed . he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme ; i heard him out and then told him to go to hell . and the very next day , the very next day , ed , i get blackmailed for the same amount .
... you know ... who *who* is ?
$ 10,000 ! i do n't know what to do , ed . i do n't know what i *can* do . even though i know who the sonofabitch is .
how much to they want , dave ?
i only work here ! and the lady 's husband would know ... oh , jesus .
uh-huh .
awkward ? ! ann 'd throw me out on my keister ! hell , it 's her family 's store -- *her* store . i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership , ed .
i guess it would be pretty awkward .
well , you know what that would do to me .
uh-huh .
hell , i , i 'm not proud of it . but , uh , that 's not the worst of it . i got a note . a blackmail note . you know , come across or everybody knows .
uh-huh .
what is it , dave ?
... ed , i ...
uh-huh .
specialty store down in sacramento .
... say , where do you get those things anyway ?
... fine . fine . well , you might want to drop by the annex when we open , update your suit -- 'course , you 're in the smock all day .
all right , i guess .
could n't be better . these 're boom times in retailing . we 're opening another store , big dave 's annex , there on garson . this is strictly haberdashery -- casual wear , pyjamas , ladies ' foundations and undergarments . matter of fact , i 'm thinking of making doris the comptroller . how 're things at the , uh , the barbershop ?
how 's business , dave ?
she 's a rare one .
mm .
... that 's quite a wife you got there .
no , dave , i was n't .
... were you in the service , ed ?
ok. take your coat , ann ?
how ya doin ' , ed ?
my wife and i had not ... performed the sex act in many years .
... hell , i hope i 've done the right thing .
i , uh ... thanks .
told what ?
... does n't become a matter of public record unless there 's foul play . however . i do n't believe i 'm *prohibited* from telling you this . i guess i 'm not obliged to tell you , either . i do n't exactly know . but if *i* were the man , i 'd want to be told .
you sure you do n't want something stiffer ?
just coffee .
rye .
nah , do n't say anything . i 'm alright .
... doris --
i knew we 'd pay for it .
honey ...
... my books used to be perfect . anyone could open them up , make sense of the whole goddamn store .
you do n't have to tell me anything .
should i ... should i tell you why ?
do n't tell 'em anything . we 're getting you freddy riedenschneider .
i know all about that . but i do n't know how much to tell them .
you do n't have to tell them anything . we 're getting you a lawyer .
i helped him cook the books , ed . i did do that .
you do n't have to --
... i do n't know what happened to big dave . i know some of it . irregularities in my books , they said . can i explain it .
what happened to you ?
i do n't know what 's going on . i --
how are you ?
honey .
it 's just a goddamn bowl of cherries , i 'm sure .
honey ...
life is so goddamn wonderful , you almost wo n't believe it .
congratulations , gina .
'gratulations , gina . it 's so goddamn wonderful .
i did n't say a word .
... what 's so damn strange about that ?
mm .
*that means i do n't run nirdlinger 's ! *
so ?
... money problems . he 's thinking about canceling the annex .
ahh ...
how 's that ?
dave .
who ?
... what a knucklehead .
oh , do n't be a grump .
nah , go ahead . i 'm not big on parties .
come on , get ready . it 's important .
yeah , right .
me ? us ! the party at nirdlinger 's -- i told you last week , for the christmas push .
where you going ?
mm .
honey ?
... my first instinct was , no , no , the whole idea was nuts . but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop , nose against the exit , afraid to try turning the knob . what if i could get the money ?
... well , he got his mistrial , but the well had run dry . there was nothing left to mortgage ; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway ...
... and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women ...
... he told them to look at me -- look at me close . that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make , that i was n't the kind of guy to kill a guy , that i was the barber , for christ 's sake ...
... who among us is in a position to say ...
... how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d.a . made me out to be , how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel , and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he had n't had a chance to trot out for doris ...
... a puny player on the great world 's stage ...
... i got ta hand it to him , he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes . he talked about how i 'd lost my place in the universe ...
i tried to tell him the whole story , but riedenschneider stopped me . he said the story made his head hurt , and anyway he did n't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave ...
not guilty , your honor ...
who ? *who ? ! * i do n't know who ! but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he 's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe 's past , then we might *know* who ! but we ca n't *know* what really happened ! because of fritz , or werner , or whatever the hell his name is ! and because me prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it 's easier to victimize your wife ! because it 's easier *not* to look ! because the more you look , the less you know ! but the beauty of it is , we do n't * got ta * know ! we just got ta show that , goddamnit , *they* do n't know . reasonable doubt . science . the atom . *you* explain it to me . go ahead . try .
so ... who ... who actually --
... did big dave mention that it was something about his war service ? i do n't know , i was n't there , *you'll* have to tell *us* . maybe he specified , maybe he did n't ; i 'm not putting words in your mouth ; the point is that this liar , this cynical manipulator , this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores , and who made a fool out of this entire town , turns to *you* to help him out of his jam . fat-assed sonofabitch !
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego . you asked for blackmail , let me give you blackmail : mr hale-fellow-well-met , about to open his own business here , has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years , probably including half the people sitting on that jury . well , it finally caught up with him -- these dopes , it always does ; someone threatened to spill it . somebody knew his dirty little secret , just like your wife says . they called , they demanded money ...
yeah .
look , chum , this is a guy , from what i understand , told everybody he was a war hero , right ? island hopping , practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth .
... i do n't get it .
will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all ?
... i do n't think so .
will anyone say they saw you there ? on your way there ? in there ? on your was back ?
i took doris 's keys .
how did you get into the store ?
i do n't know . i do n't think so .
will anyone else say they knew ?
i ... just knew . a husband knows .
ok , how did you know ?
he and doris ... were having an affair .
ok , we forget the blackmail . *you* killed him . how come ?
*i* was with her .
-- do n't interrupt me -- that 's means . they got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim , and then they got *you* , a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home , alone .
it was big dave 's .
... you 've got ta give me something to work with . freddy riedenschneider is good , but he 's not a magician . he ca n't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize . look . look at what the other side is gon na run at us . they got the company books , prepared by you -- *cooked* by you -- that 's motive . they got a murder scene *you* had access to . that 's opportunity . they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with -- a *dame's* weapon --
terrific . your husband backs you up . that 's terrific .
i knew about it . big dave told me about it , and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money .
good ! any questions give me a ring -- turandot suite ; if i 'm out leave a message . you sure you do n't want anything ? no ?
... ok .
good ! that helps . not that she did n't do it , that she did n't confess . of course , there 's ways to deal with a confession , but that 's good ! -- one less thing to think about . now . interview . i 'm seeing her tomorrow . you should be there . three o'clock . one more thing : you keep your mouth shut . i get the lay of the land , i tell *you* what to say . no talking out of school . what 's out of school ? everything 's out of school . i do the talking ; you keep your trap shut . i 'm an attorney , you 're a barber ; you do n't know anything . understood ?
no . of course not . she did n't do it .
look , i do n't wan na waste your time so i 'll eat while we talk . ya mind ? *you* do n't mind . so while i 'm in town i 'll be staying at the hotel metropole , the turandot suite . yeah , it 's goofy , the suites 're named after operas ; room 's ok though , i poked around . i 'm having 'em hold it for me on account of i 'll be back and forth . in addition to my retainer , you 're paying hotel , living expenses , secretarial , private eye if we need to make inquiries , headshrinker should we go that way . we 'll talk about appeals if , as and when . for right now , has she confessed ?
sure , walter . thanks .
birdy 's in the parlor -- i 'm on long distance here .
yeah .
i 'm so damn sorry about your loss . terrible thing . just damn terrible .
i 'm ok , walter , thanks .
ed , how 're you holding up ?
yeah , the best .
uh-huh . he 's the , uh ...
well , the best , the money-is-no-object best , for a criminal case , any lawyer would tell you freddy riedenschneider . out of sacramento . 'course , i do n't know how you 're fixed for money .
uh-huh . is he the best then , for , uh ...
... probity .
well , there 's lloyd garroway in san francisco . probity -- you know , no one ever said anything iffy about lloyd garroway . conservative . jury might like that . might like that here .
... so , uh , who should i --
no thanks , honey .
i 'm fine . thanks .
coffee , ed ?
so , who should i --
taking it seriously .
so --
bert 's ok , sure , he 's a good man . i wo n't kid you though , ed , nobody around here has any experience with this kind of , er ... and i hear they 're bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento . capital offense . taking it seriously ... hmm ...
he a good man ?
'scuse me , just finished dinner . um . frankly , doris 'd be better off with the county defender .
well , of course , i , uh , it 's out of my league , criminal stuff . i do , uh , probate , real estate , title search , uh ... i 'd be absolutely worthless , something like this . absolutely worthless .
yeah . what do i , uh ...
ok. boy . jesus !
i 'm fine .
sure you do n't need one ?
no thanks .
oh , hell . drink ?
thanks . thanks for seeing me , at home .
uh-huh .
check out the rack on that broad in the angora .
yeah .
uh-huh . some beat , huh ?
i do n't work here . my wife does .
have n't i seen you up in ladies ' wear ?
... huh ?
sorry , i just did n't remember .
... i 'm rachel abundas . everyone calls me birdy .
i know who you are , mr crane .
that was something . i 'm ed crane .
he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas .
that was quite something .
oh , no . that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven .
... did you make that up ?
they too use the toilet , ed . in spite of appearances . and their money will be secured by the barbershop . a rock . a *rock* , the barbershop . i mean , how long has *this* place been here ?
uh-huh .
just people . they got ta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money . this is why the big lobby , ed . but they put their pants on one leg at a time . just like you and me .
uh-huh .
they 're just people like you and me , ed . remember that .
the hell with it , eddie !
that 's very generous .
i do n't care what it costs ! this is when ya come together !
frank , uh , you know i 'll try to contribute , but , uh -- freddy riedenschneider --
close ranks ! goddamnit ! those sons of bitches !
yeah .
this is what family is for , ed ! this is when ya come together !
damn , i got a headache to beat the band .
... nah .
you do n't got a headache ?
ok .
... how you today , ed ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
i 'm gon na mingle it with common house dirt .
what the --
... i 'm gon na take his hair and throw it out in the dirt .
come on , eddie , you 're gon na scare the kid .
no , i mean it 's growing , it 's part of us . and we cut it off . and throw it away .
yeah -- lucky for us , huh , pal ?
i do n't know ... how it keeps on coming . it just keeps growing .
whuddya mean ?
... you ever wonder about it ?
yeah .
this hair .
huh ?
frank .
yeah , yeah -- go home .
... you sure , eddie ?
sure , go to the store . go there , describe to the man where you will be fishing , and for what , and the weather conditions , sun , no sun , whatnot , and so forth , and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish , ed ...
yeah .
sportsmanship ! that 's my point . june fly , ed ? mosquito ? which of these ? well , what fish do you seek ?
uh-huh .
the point is there 's a certain art to the process . the point is not merely to provide , and let me point out , these fish are not as dumb as you might think .
uh-huh .
... so you tie your own flies , ed . i mean , if you 're really serious . you tie your own flies , you do a -- i know it 's matickless , i know , people say , hey , you can buy flies at the store -- but you can buy your fish at the store , ed , you see what i 'm saying ?
now , being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk ; there 's not much to it once you 've learned the basic moves . for the kids there 's the butch , or the heinie ...
jesus ...
yeah .
russians exploded an a-bomb .
huh ?
... ed ?
how d'ya like them apples ?
uh-huh .
says here that the russians exploded n a-bomb and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it .
birdy ...

birdy ... i did n't mean to --
he 's the dead guy .
i do n't understand .
my *wife* ?
they sent us to tell ya . we pulled the detail .
huh ?
huh ? no .
... we goin ' ?
well , have you ever considered tar macadam ? people think it 's just for public works and commercial purposes , roads , parking lots , so forth ...

as soon as the doctor lets us , we got ta move you . does he understand that ? we 're supposed to tell him . are you conscious ?
uh ... you 're under arrest .
his eyes are open .
crane ? we have to tell you , as soon as you 're conscious -- is he conscious ?
are you awake ? ... is he awake ?
sorry , pal . they sent us to tell ya .
visiting ends at five . too late today . you can see her tomorrow .
... yeah , it 's a tough break .
well , embezzlement . and homicide . a guy named david brewster . he 's , uh ... he 's the decedent .
homicide .
yeah , uh , they brung her to the county jail , uh ...
they sent us to tell ya .
... look , pal , it 's a tough break , but , uh ... well damnit , your wife 's been pinched .
i 'm in .
there 's some kind of animal loose in the museum . pendergast 's alone . he needs help . i want volunteers to go with me .
great .
manual overrides are n't working . i 'm getting nothing , lieutenant .
no .
there are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder . claimed they saw a monster . they 're pretty determined to tell you their story . you want to see them ?
it better be good .
uh , vince . sorry . this wo n't wait .
no one broke into this room , sir . someone broke out . that lock was torn off from the < u > inside < /u > .
why not ?
do n't know if it 'll do any good , mr. cuthbert .
the claws are sharp ... i must have cut myself . better move these crates to the secure storage area where they 'll be safe .
looks like the curse is still at work .
does n't look like it . we 're damned lucky . this statue is priceless .
anything missin ' ?
someone broke into this room .
i 'm sorry , sir . you okay ?
beauregard ! you scared me half to death .
i have to help pendergast . kawakita and jonathan stay with me . the rest of you can go with cuthbert !
my office is on the third floor ! there 's a walk-in safe and a portable phone ! we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help !
get his gun and his walkie talkie , jonathan . move .
sweet jesus !
he 'll be back . relax . we 're in good shape . your security is air tight . there 've been no more incidents , nothing suspicious . there 's no reason to call off the opening now .
pendergast may be in trouble . do n't you understand ? he still has n't come back . it 's been over three hours --
you have n't got the authority . only pendergast can pull the plug .
i 'll go down and speak to him .
it 's too late now . guests are arriving . the mayor 's car is pulling up .
i 'm telling you , something 's wrong . i still have n't heard from pendergast . i think you should call it off .
i appreciate that .
we all love the museum . i come here myself with my kids . we 're trying to work with you .
i understand . but mr. cuthbert , we 've got bigger problems . depending on what we find today , we may have to shut you down .
i do n't want to scare people .
yes .
do they have to wear uniforms ?
if the party goes forward , and that 's a big if ... i 've arranged for a large police presence .
we 've been operating in the red for years . that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit . it was designed to pull people in . we 've spent every penny we have on advance publicity , betting everything on the opening 's success . if we postpone at the last minute ... no . i do n't want to think about that .
i 've read about the museum 's financial troubles .
if you like them , they 're for sale . another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block .
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi 's forum sketches .
eight to the right ! look ! i found it !
fifteen ... what 's next ?
oh jesus ...
to the left twice then five no ... sorry ... i think it 's fifteen ... it 's been a while ...
for chrissake , i 'll do it . what 's the combination ? !
just a minute . i 'm shaking ! take the gun .
hurry up !
that thing wo n't come after us , right ? it 's going for bigger game . the group blundering around in the basement . poor fools .
let 's go !
battery 's dead . shit .
calm down . i found it !
forget it !
i 'll do it . just let me find my portable phone .
what 's the combination ?
behind you .
where 's the walk-in safe ?
i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring .
it 's a little late , you son of a bitch . there 's a friggin ' monster loose in here ! get the fbi , the fire department . find metal cutters , cut through . and bring a cannon . the damn thing is huge .
i made it outside . i 'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here . help is on the way . just sit tight .
where the hell are you ?
d'agosta ? ippolito . come in .
like hell !
ippolito ! get back here !
you said the system could n't fail !
i told you ! they seal off all the cells . they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
what doors ?
the whole system is shutting down ! we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall !
you do n't know much about computers , lieutenant . there are safeguards built in . we have back-up systems with redundancies . there 's no way these computers can fail .
that would leave one exit for hundreds of people . you 'd be violating every fire regulation on the books . we 'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells . one more question . i see a big hole . if this entire thing is run by computer , what happens if the power fails ?
in every exhibition room . the museum 's divided into five cells . the reception and exhibit are in cell five . we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four , then seal the perimeter with our fire doors .
that 's great if you 're stopping a burglar . not our goal here . are there motion detectors ?
it 's fool proof , basically . i designed this whole thing myself . every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip . if anything 's moved so much as an inch , we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft .
the cops are non-negotiable , ippolito . why do n't you just tell me how this space station works .
this huge police presence tonight is n't necessary , lieutenant . you 'll just scare people off . i can handle the security behind scenes with this system . it 's state of the art .
the sub-basement , huh ? great idea .
nice to see you , lieutenant .
everybody . get behind me .
go out the north exit ! there 's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases . run !
i smell it . it 's here .
i 've been down there . it links up to the old sewer system . i can guide you out .
the sub-basement ?
vince ? there 's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down . there 's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit .
this door 's locked . try shooting the hinges off .
pendergast ! help ! it 's right behind us !
we have n't got time . you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight .
i think i should come with you .
apparently it 's huge .
how big is the sub-basement ?
you 've been holding out on me pendergast . you have a suspect capable of this ?
this is n't an animal , vince . i 've been on this case four months , remember ? i 've learned a few things .
i do n't like animals . never have . dog bit me when i was little . after that i gave up on pets . animals are irrational . give me a psychotic killer any day . if there 's one thing that makes me queasy it 's being part of a food chain . my first case as a rookie , two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo . it was late august . over ninety . the polar bear was inside his cave . kids did n't know he was in there . all they saw was the pool . they got to swimming and splashing . the noise woke up the bear . by the time i arrived , both little boys were in pieces . the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot . i can still hear the mother screaming --
correct .
saliva test ? you mean , you think someone ate part of the brain ?
if you do n't mind a suggestion , you might try a saliva test .
what happened to them ?
oh .
no . i think what we 've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon ... who wants us to believe he 's a monster .
you think what we 've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells ... like hamburger ?
i believed them .
they heard the victim 's name and wove him into their story . nice touch .
how do you explain the part about beauregard ?
i 've got to admit , that was a damn sight better than `` the dog ate my homework '' .
unfortunately , no .
you 're kidding .
if you do n't mind , this could be important .
no . there 's more . there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat .
so the method of death is the only connection ?
yes . that 's my case . now it 's yours . all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way . decapitated . brains extracted . limbs torn to shreds . it looked like the work of a large animal , but there was no sign of an animal on board .
who did n't ? big news . out of brazil , was n't it ?
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago ? twelve bodies on board .
call me vince .
lieutenant --
then you wo n't like this one . it 's a piece of shit .
not at all . i enjoy the smell of a good cigar .
i drink . after hours of course . on duty , i smoke . do you mind ?
in this violent world , i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things .
ca n't really focus on birds at the moment , pendergast . i 'm tryin ' to keep my breakfast down .
an original roger tory peterson of a red-breasted merganser . amazing . i have a copy of this in my office at home .
night watchman who found the body . sweet old man . been tossing his cookies for over an hour . not a likely suspect .
whose footprints ?
careful . that mess on the ground is brains .
where 's the head ?
we need light in here , stat .
mind if i have a look ?
what 's left of it .
the body ?
not at all . i think we may be working on the same case . if so , i could use your help .
vince d'agosta . am i out ?
special agent pendergast . fbi .
who are you ? the undertaker ?
the virus itself might have positive applications . they 'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made . greg is n't joining us ?
should n't a drug that powerful be destroyed ?
this on top of the scratches ... is n't it proof !
pardon my french , but bull shit .
did you hear that ? my god . he says that mbwun is real !
may i see that ?
look . it 's some kind of letter .
i 'm one of the few who know every inch it , now that john is gone .
this place is a maze .
i 'd say we 're in its home .
dear god . where are we , lieutenant ?
i do n't know . i thought dr. whittlesley died in south america .
what 's that doing here ?
dr. john whittlesley .
what does it say ?
all right everybody , hold up !
what 's that ?
not so loud .
i believe in you a hundred percent , vince , but that 's the second time we 've been at that intersection .
oh shit .
all right . kawakita , cover the rear .
you 're asking me ? i do n't even know how to load this thing .
how much ammo do we have to make a stand ?
i know .
it 's still back there !
there 's a dead body in the exhibit ! people are panicking , trampling each other trying to get out .
what happened ? !
it 's important . please . you have to come ! pendergast , too . she 's found out something .
got my hands full here .
dr. green has to see you !
what is it ?
lieutenant ! it 's me .
yes . two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision .
the thalamus and the hypothalamus , perhaps ?
curious . there 's something missing .
right . the entire brain appears to have been extracted . may i see it , please ?
someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa .
what are we talking about here ?
lovely bouquet . after our last case , vince took me out for a draft beer . as i recall we split the check .
i hope you liked it .
oh yes ! who could forget . afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte .
we 've met . the hacksaw murders . '89 .
look who 's here , margo .
dr. frock ?
remember , it has poor eyesight . it hunts with its sense of smell . so for god 's sake , margo , do n't get those fibers on your clothes !
we will .
come back and get me .
no , dr. frock . you ca n't .
i 'm coming with you .
that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes .
we ca n't . we 've managed to get inside the one place that 's safe . i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements . if we go outside , we 're risking more lives . you have to accept it , margo , there 's nothing we can do . the building must be swarming with police by now . it wo n't take long for them to get through the doors .
none of that matters now . the people upstairs need us . we have to help .
it 's one of the fire doors . good lord , margo . we 're trapped !
what 's that ?
do n't stop now .
dr. frock . did you hear that ?
i think so .
some kind of power failure . maybe it 's the storm . do you have a flashlight ?
what 's going on ?
it 's like ringing the dinner bell .
and it 's hungry . it 's been two days since it 's eaten . there are five hundred people arriving right now . the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell ! all those people in one enclosed space ...
margo , what you 've just described is a killing machine .
with the intelligence of a human being , the speed of a greyhound , and the strength of a grizzly bear .
so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night .
`` nocturnal . external hair and bony plates . locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers . reduced optic chiasm '' ... poor eyesight . `` external mucoid nasal glands , '' ... very keen scent ... `` morphological characteristics : highly robust . aggressiveness : extreme . ''
quadrupedal ! the other name for mbwun . `` he who walks on all fours . ''
all right , assuming the program is accurate , this is a description of the animal with that claw . `` species unidentified . genus : unidentified . phylum unknown . male , weight in excess of 240 kg . brain capacity , 900 centimeters . '' that means it 's highly intelligent . `` quadrupedal . ''
but a virus normally codes for other viruses . this one 's making human and animal proteins . listen to this . `` glycotetraglycine collagenoid . weinstein 's tropic hormone . 4- monoxytocin supressin hormone . ''
that 's not so unusual . many plants carry viruses . like the burls on maple trees .
look at this . an ambyloid reovirus protein . that explains why the computer 's confused . the plant 's infected with a virus .
several problems with that theory . for one thing , this egg is intact . for another , according to pendergast , the crates were shipped here on a boat . everyone on board was killed like beauregard . if the thing hatched in mid-ocean , where did it go ?
come on , margo . we 're on the verge of something huge . let 's consider the possibility , just the three of us , alone in this room . what if john was right . i mean , what if ? and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates . when it got to the museum , it hatched .
let 's not jump to conclusions . this egg could belong to any number of reptiles , dr. frock .
like the claw .
they 're eggs .
what are they ?
margo , these are n't seed pods .
you 're right .
whatever it is , it must be common on the tepui . john used it as packing material .
i 'm not sure . as you know , the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years . species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct . this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant .
what is it ?
let me see the plant press .
a blow dart . seed pods . a plant press . pretty unimpressive stuff .
i ca n't help thinking there 's something that pendergast overlooked . if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard , it wants something that 's in here .
cuthbert 's counting on the exhibition 's success . the museum is in debt . contributions and public funding have dried up . admissions no longer cover overhead . the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit . cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red . if the superstition exhibit is n't lucrative , he 'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems .
that cuthbert . what a piece of work . someone 's dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit .
everyone needs a change of scenery . i 've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years . that 's quite enough .
you are this museum . it wo n't be the same without you .
this is n't a death sentence . greg has promised to teach me fly fishing . i 'll garden . i 'll write .
you must .
i 'm not giving up .
come on . i 'll walk you back to the elevator .
healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art .
your work is highly relevant . what about your display on primitive pharmacology ? cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit .
with all due respect , dear , that 's bull . you dance rings around me with your new technology . you 've left me in the dust .
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you .
yes it is . i 'm tired and i 'm no longer needed --
how can you say that ? you know it 's not true .
no , margo . this is one problem you ca n't solve . you have to stay out of it . the fact is , i want to retire .
let me help . i can take care of everything .
please . do n't humiliate me further .
that , apparently , is the problem . i 'm yesterday 's news . who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants ? monsters and dinosaurs , cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm .
we ca n't do without you . you 're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology . you 're practically an institution around here .
now margo , do n't overreact . cuthbert has to cut costs somehow . my leaving makes perfect sense . this is n't exactly early retirement . i 've overstayed the party a bit .
i do n't believe it .
yes . bit of a shock . but as cuthbert so tactfully put it , the museum needs new blood . and since i 've been here since the mesozoic era --
they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta .
dr. frock , i was wondering . what happened to the rest of whittlesley 's plants ?
footsteps !
what 's that ?
he 's right .
margo , this is too dangerous . you always think you can solve everything . this time you do n't have enough information . the animal might behave in unexpected ways . leave her here with me . do n't put her in danger .
i do n't believe it .
we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate .
you said you had plans of the museum . could we see them , please ?
i do n't know . it was walled over . no one 's been down there in years .
where is that ?
not really . just the sub-basement .
are there any hidden rooms or staircases ? places where someone could hide ?
yes .
you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum .
`` dear louis , tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we 'll be in the greatest danger , so i 'm sending carlos back with the crates . you always believed in me , louis , even in the darkest days . so it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded . we 've made an incredible find . i enclose a representation of mbwun . note the exaggerated claws , the reptilian attributes , the hints of bipedalia . it 's beyond belief , but this statue is accurate . i know because i 've seen the beast . ''
read it out loud .
it 's from john . those two arrows were his insignia . it 's addressed to louis moriarty , a patron who financed his expeditions .
i would n't be so sure .
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum !
and failed . these doors are solid steel .
something tried to get into this room !
yes . john made quite a study of the whole museum . he had a copy of my original plans .
do you mean dr. whittlesley ?
they fill seven floors . we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world . just to give you an idea , there are more than three million insects specimens . not to mention amphibians , reptiles , birds , anthropological artifacts , meteorites , minerals and gems . only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display .
how many storage areas are there ?
happy to be useful . it 's rare enough these days . according to security , beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area 1012 .
thank you for taking the time to help us with this , dr. frock .
fourth floor , west wing , but stay with your class .
way cool . then you know where the dinosaurs are .
evolutionary biologist . i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years .
nothing . i 'm in third grade . what 's a revolutionary what ch'a ma ' callit ?
i 'm an evolutionary biologist . what do you do ?
what do you do ?
yes , i do .
you work here ?
you 're color blind .
they were yellow !
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard 's .
it had a long tongue , teeth this big and yellow eyes .
like this .
and it snuffled the ground like a dog .
well almost . depends which house . it smelled like old hamburger , and it made this weird noise .
not that big .
big as a house .
we were just lost , okay ? and we went down this curvy staircase . at the bottom was a big shadow .
i do n't know . but i think it 's bad .
what is it ?
quiet !
do n't be a wuss . come on .
i do n't want to go this way .
chicken . this is a great short cut .
we 're not supposed to go back there .
let 's ditch and find them ourselves .
she 's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs . that lady said they were on the fourth floor .
this room sucks .
keep the animal quiet .
oh no . i smell it .
another storage room .
jesus , what is this ?
quiet .
oh ... my ... god !
not on the map . looks like it connects with the city sewer .
it 's alright . i can tell by the way the dog 's acting that whatever was out there is gone . what is this place ?
come on . let 's get back to the others . we ca n't leave them alone .
look . it 's hobbes ! he 's all right .
he 's right . follow me .
there 's something out there ! let 's go get it now ! that 's why we came down here , is n't it ?
get back ! now !
argo ! hobbes !
holy mother , what is that ?
stop !
heel argo ! hobbes ! heel !
shut them up !
keep the light up . i ca n't see .
they 've got something .
not yet . let 's try the fork to the left .
the dogs have lost the scent , mr. pendergast . maybe we should head back .
hard to read in this light . the ink is so faded .
okay .
not today . besides , i think the director of the museum is expecting you .
how about lunch ?
got to finish this thesis sometime .
yes , he 's fine . greg ... take care of yourself !
is dr. frock safe !
yes . whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant . when the crates were put in secure storage , they were out of reach . the killer could n't get them , so it got the next best thing .
eats them ?
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim 's brains !
so what ?
this is it . this is what he , or it ... is after ! the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain !
try weinstein 's tropic hormone .
4-monoxytocin is ... `` a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland . ''
what kind of hormones ?
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones !
it 's reptilian .
what kind of egg is it ?
there 's another possibility . a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage .
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand ? impossible . the sample must be contaminated .
turkish gecko , i believe . a lizard .
it 's not mammalian , that 's for sure . i think it 's reptilian .
what do you make of it , margo ?
what 's that ?
mbwun .
someone 's been murdered . not shot , strangled or stabbed , either . torn limb from limb . there 's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal .
for once i 'm glad you 're rumor central . what in the world is going on ?
i 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings , but you know me . telegraph . telephone . tell kawakita . i got the definitive word from cuthbert 's secretary . this is dr. frock 's last week .
that 's impossible .
frock 's been fired .
what ?
margo , you have n't heard ?
i have the species identification on these teeth . we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program . call dr. frock . he wanted a demonstration .
but at what a price .
if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod , i 'd have my phd .
i 'm in town on a case . dropped by to see vince and we thought we 'd see the new display .
i 'm so glad to see you . what 's the occasion ?
you have to . do it now !
i ca n't !
he has to look here or i wo n't get a clear shot . call him , margo .
do it , quickly . please . aim for the eye .
i have to shoot .
just like john . he wo n't listen .
whatever that thing is , we have to kill it !
you have to ! listen ! all viruses pass on their own dna . instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses ! this one was different . it inserted a whole array of genes into john . reptile genes , sixty five million years old . those genes remade him ! it 's not his fault !
i do n't believe it .
that thing is john whittlesley . i should have seen it before ! the fibers are infected with a virus . you eat them , and the virus alters your dna ! he became addicted to them in south america , followed the plants back to the states . he probably entered the country as a man . it would have taken several months for the change to take place . that 's how he got from the boat to the museum !
what ?
no ! do n't kill him ! pendergast , you were right . it 's john !
listen to me , pendergast . mbwun 's dna is part homo sapien . in primates , the eye is a direct path to the brain ! if you get a clean shot , there 's only one place you can kill it . shoot it in the eye !
we 're not going to make the storage room !
it 's coming . run .
you smell that ?
oh god ! help !
help someone !
it 's deceptively simple . like a bruckner symphony or a matisse .
that 's a ptarmigan , feigning a broken wing . the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest !
the answer 's right in front of us .
how ?
we have to try and draw it off !
i think ... for the pleasure of the kill .
for what ?
no . it 's still hunting , but not for the hormones .
then it wo n't go after the others ?
i think ... it means it 's full .
it did n't want the fibers . what does that mean ?
its eyesight is worse than i thought . it could n't see us . and it could n't smell us through the glass .
what happened ?
it 's scared of me .
what is it doing ?
what are you going to do ?
hide quickly !
no . the planetarium is in the next cell . this is one of the fire doors ...
is there another way around ?
vince !
the planetarium !
that was d'agosta .
unlock one of the other storage rooms . we 're going upstairs . we 'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here .
you 'd slow us down and put margo in danger .
we have the fibers . do n't you see ? the creature is hungry . it wants the hormones in these plants . it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what 's in these fibers . we 're just a poor substitute . to make it stop hunting , we have to give it what it wants .
but what can we do ? our guns are useless --
but this is n't the jungle ! this is new york . how did it get here ? a thing like that crossed two continents . it makes no sense !
it 's not supernatural . mbwun is an animal . part lizard , part human , a genetic freak of some kind , like the half-goat , half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam .
i do n't know how to deal with this . it 's hellish . like nothing i ever saw . i 'm not trained to deal with a monster , a supernatural creature like that .
that would fit . it 's nocturnal . quick . come inside .
no . a chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing 's skull like a spit ball . i think it was bothered by my light .
wounded ?
gone .
you 're not . where is it ?
no . i think i 'm hallucinating .
pendergast ? are you all right ?
we need someone to take us to the secure storage area .
when dna is defective , it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair . viruses can damage dna . so can radiation , certain chemicals . even cancer . let 's let the g.s.e . sort it out . i have to get started . this will take several hours .
genetic damage ?
i do n't know . mr. pendergast . do me a favor . get me a dna readout on that claw .
what was it ?
all right . this is hard for me . i 'm a scientist . i like order and logic . sometimes too much . there 's got to be an explanation . there ca n't be an animal in there . but i saw something .
they 're all heavily armed .
i did n't imagine it . i know what i saw . are you sure there are enough men in there ?
dr. green ...
all right . if you 're positive .
that 's not what i saw .
behind me . over there .
where did you see it ?
it 's okay , i 'm all right . i remember now ... it was an animal . something large ! i could smell it . it was hunting me . i saw two green eyes in the dark .
you were behind me ? running after me ?
i heard you calling and i ran after you , but you kept disappearing and i could n't keep up .
i do n't know .
what happened ?
all right . i 'm as macho as you are . perhaps .
i 'm not sure . we should split up . you take that hall and i 'll take this one .
where would we find it ?
would you mind showing it to me ?
i do n't know . he sent back a statue that 's supposed to be an exact representation . but i 've never seen it . it 's in the exhibit .
i do n't think so . i think we were meant to think it was mbwun . did whittlesley 's monster have claws ?
my god . then it was an animal .
something came up in autopsy tonight . imbedded in beauregard 's body we found a claw .
i do n't understand .
what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there ? was he desperate enough to create one ?
no . i 'm all right . i wo n't let this affect me anymore . john would n't get help . his ego endangered the lives of others . his theory came first .
no one knows . the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals .
what happened ?
yes . he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect . it held that evolution was n't always gradual or driven by natural selection . the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a `` monster species '' . it made no sense . but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster , living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years .
a monster ?
a legendary monster called mbwun .
tell me about the last expedition . what was he looking for ?
he was afraid of himself . he tried suicide once . he was ill. manic depressive . he had wild emotional highs and lows . not a happy affliction for a scientist . he 'd been revered in our community . by the end he was a joke .
you were afraid of him , were n't you ?
that was two years ago . john was still in love with me . he would n't leave me alone .
i ran an internet search on dr. whittlesley . got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times . i also found a record of your restraining order .
how did you know that ?
you were going to be married .
yes . once . we met at columbia . john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there .
you loved him .
john could n't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that . he was a fine man despite his problems --
the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten . just like beauregard . one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision . the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact .
i do n't understand .
disappeared . his body was n't among the victims .
and john ?
dr. whittlesley was last seen in belem , venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared . a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat . that boat washed up in my district . everyone on board was killed .
you have time to talk ?
if he were alive he 'd have contacted me .
maybe not .
somehow , when all this happened ... i knew it would come back to john . is he really dead ?
no . i came to talk about dr. john whittlesley .
with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal , whether it was nocturnal , what it ate , how it hunted , how big it was ... you are n't here for a lesson in dna .
how does it work ?
an invention of mine . it 's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna . i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator .
special agent pendergast . fbi . forgive me . i guess i was snooping . what is this ?
it does n't matter . i 'll make other arrangements .
you want to book the flight ?
that 's right .
i thought you were in a hurry .
why would n't i ?
i do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for fiji tomorrow . but you would n't want to do that .
you are a travel agent , are n't you ? `` doris '' ? your job is to help people travel .
it 's the busy season .
< i > a month. < /i >
i 'm sorry . i do n't have anything for at least a month .
today .
when do you want to leave , remembering , of course , you do lose a day on the way there ?
one .
viti levu . for how many ?
i 'm sorry , er ... the biggest one .
< i > where < /i > in fiji ? what island ?
< i > fiji. < /i >
where exactly ?
i want to book a flight to fiji .
i 'm sorry to keep you . how can i help ?
do it !
he does n't care .
< i > storm < /i > music ... wagner ...
what music ?
cue music ...
sweep the harbor .
why would we --
we 're not watching the sea .
it 's just a matter of time .
what have we missed ?
i 'm sure we 'll get him on this next sweep .
he has to be on foot . he has the world 's most recognizable face . he ca n't disappear .
all prop cars accounted for ?
we 've declared a curfew . everyone else is at first positions .
he gave it back to his father .
give me a shot from truman 's ring .
he was tidying up his garbage . i was going to call you . but half-way through , he gave up and fell asleep .
what happened down there ?
what 's on the clockcam ?
what 's to see ?
why was n't i told ? any unpredictable behavior has to be reported . is that the best shot we can get ?
he moved down there after meryl packed up and left .
why is he in the basement ?
no , hold back ...
close up ?
let 's take another call . london , england , you 're on `` tru talk . ''
we 've learnt about life as truman has and , despite the complaints of a minority , it 's been an overwhelmingly positive experience , for truman and for the viewing public .
the hague for christof ... the hague ? ... lost them . hollywood , california , you 're on `` tru talk . ''
i 've been tempted . but i think it 's important to retain objectivity . i would n't want to get emotionally caught up .
you 've never actually met truman , yourself . never thought about doing a cameo -- playing a veterinarian , or a priest , something like that ?
we accept the reality of the world with which we 're presented . as the show expanded , naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep truman in seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk .
why do you feel that truman 's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world ?
and it 's all available in the `` truman '' show '' catalogue . operators are standing by .
there 's nothing on the show i do n't use myself .
all products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value .
yes , everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors ' wardrobe , food products , to the very homes they live in --
no , of course not . and since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement .
people forget it takes the < i > population < /i > of an entire country to keep the show running .
and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country .
that 's correct .
who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - `` bringing up baby '' - would turn into a `` cradle to grave '' concept . he is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation .
in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .
of course , his eagerness to leave his mother 's womb also meant he was the one selected .
he was curious from birth - premature by two weeks , as if he could n't wait to get started .
let me demonstrate some examples .
we should remind viewers that truman , especially as a child , presented a challenge for the production .
istanbul , turkey , you 're on with master videographer , christof .
as with our own lives , the only people he ca n't cast are his family . otherwise he has final approval , able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend , marlon , or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player .
of course , truman has always been very much in on casting .
certainly a nomination .
are we talking emmies ?
let 's go to some of those viewers ' calls .
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort . have n't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep ?
but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps ?
not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth , he gives us a glimpse of ourselves .
i prefer to think of it as a mirror .
a window onto the human condition ?
we 've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . while the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there 's nothing fake about truman himself . no scripts , no cue cards . it 's not always shakespeare but it 's genuine . that 's how he can support an entire channel .
it has to be the reality .
but recent events have been so dramatic , it does raise the perennial question . what keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating , sleeping , working , sitting for hours in contemplation ?
as you know ratings have never been our primary goal . i imagine we 'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing truman 's latest torment . however , i 'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal .
let 's talk ratings . `` truman '' has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days -- how do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled himself ?
of course .
amnesia .
how < i > do < /i > you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence ?
that and a fat , new contract .
i understand he 's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show . how did you convince him -- was it the opportunity to be close to truman again ?
since kirk started this whole crisis in truman 's life , i came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it .
-- and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role . i really must congratulate you on writing kirk back in . a master stroke .
-- a dead one at that .
of course , there has n't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member --
we < i > have < /i > had our close calls in the past .
the catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course truman 's father , kirk , and his infiltration onto the show . before we discuss that , it 's worth reminding viewers that this is n't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach truman .
thank you .
welcome .
-- you never had a camera in my head .
truman , i 've watched you your whole life . i saw you take your first step , your first word , your first kiss . i know you better than you know yourself . you 're not going to walk out that door --
i have a map .
< i > you < /i > were real . that 's what made you you so good to watch .
nothing was real .
you 're the star .
< i > a show. < /i > then who am i ?
a show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions .
the creator of what ?
i 'm the creator .
who are you ?
i ca n't believe he married meryl on the rebound .
because his mother got sick - very sick . he could n't leave her . he 's a kind boy , maybe too kind .
but why did n't he just follow her to fiji ?
shhh !
the memory of who ?
they removed all physical trace of her but they could n't erase the memory .
what 's he doing ?
guess i always thought they 'd adopt .
sure she would .
you think she 'd go through with it ?
why not ?
it 's not gon na be his , you idiot .
how can they have a child ?
i ... i ca n't .
it 's beautiful ! what are you waiting for ?
i think i 've studied enough .
well , what do you want to do ?
if we do n't go now , it wo n't happen .
right now ? we 've got finals tomorrow .
now .
actually , i 'm free sunday .
saturday ?
no .
no ? really ? good , i mean , i thought possibly a pizza . how about friday ?
no ... i , er .
you have a boyfriend ? of course you do .
i 'm sorry . it 's not up to me .
it 's okay . i probably would n't talk to me either .
-- i 'm not allowed to talk to you .
i 'm truman , truman burbank --
that 's right . lauren .
lauren , right ?
oh , yes .
you take japanese .
the thing that started all of this .
what 's that ?
not the whole thing , truman . you were right about one thing .
so what are you saying , marlon , the whole thing has been in my head -- ?
and the last thing i 'd ever do is lie to you . think about it , truman , if everybody 's in on it , i 'd have to be in on it too . i 'm not in on it , because there is no < i > it. < /i >
this is different . everybody seems to be in on it .
it 's a lot of world for one man . you sure that 's not wishful thinking , you wishing you 'd made something more of yourself ? christ , truman , who has n't sat on the john and had an imaginary interview on `` seahaven tonight '' ? who has n't wanted to be somebody ?
i do n't know what to think , marlon . maybe i 'm going out of my mind , but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow .
truman ? it 's me , marlon . i need to talk to you .
stay where you are !
really ?
just between you and me , marlon , i 'm going away for a while .
that 's the `` big guy '' . quite a paintbrush he 's got .
yeah ...
i went all over but i never found a place like this . look at that sunset , truman . it 's perfect .
when you were hauling chickens for kaiser poultry , what was the furthest you ever went off the island ?
no .
things . things that does n't fit . maybe i 'm being set up for something . you ever feel like that , marlon ? like your whole life has been building to something ?
what exactly ?
this is where it started .
what 're we doing here , truman ?
i 've got to show you something .
i told you i ca n't .
could be . beard looks phony . it 's when i 'm unpredictable . they ca n't stand that . that 's why we 've got to get out of here . can you come with me ?
how about them ?
it 's hard to tell . they look just like regular people .
who ?
i think he 's alive . i 'll tell you about it later . i 'm definitely being followed .
your dad ? !
i think it 's got something to do with my dad .
no . truman , if this is another one of your fantasies ...
there 's no point in trying to explain it , but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that do n't go anywhere , people talking about me on the radio , you know what i mean ?
< i > mixed up ? < /i > mixed up in what ?
i think i 'm mixed up in something .
are you okay ? you look like shit .
i 'm onto something , marlon - something big .
sorry , i 'm way behind .
i 've got to talk to you .
-- truman , what are you doing here ?
marlon --
i ca n't tonight .
sure . it 's halogen . shame it did n't hit you - you could 've sued . you coming for a drink ?
you really think it could 've dropped off an airliner ?
trust me .
you think so ?
i figured , what 's the point ? i knew i 'd just be taking my problems with me . once the kids came along , it made me look at seahaven with new eyes . i realized , what the hell could be better than this ? i 'm telling you . what you really need is someone to carry on the `` burbank '' name .
yeah , what happened ?
truman , you know , i did think about moving away one time .
< i > spare room < /i > - i can start thinking about selling up ... and i 'll be gone . up and away on that big steel bird . i 'm going , do n't you worry about that .
nursery ?
it 's not that simple . takes money , planning . you ca n't just up and go . oh , i 'm going to do it , do n't worry about that . i 've just got to move slow . pick my moment . bonus time 's just around the corner . soon as i finish the ...
so when are you leaving ?
see here , this is us . all the way round here , fiji . you ca n't get any further away before you start coming back . y'know , there are still islands in fiji where no human has ever set foot .
outta my job , outta seahaven , off this island ... < i > out ! < /i >
yeah ? outta what ?
i 'm thinking of getting out , marlon .
-- truman , you 're gon na be late !
-- what are my plans now ? well , next i 'm thinking of tackling the yuba river in an authentic canoe from the algonquin tribe . -- i 'm talking about the north fork , a class five rapid - only i 'm not going < i > down < /i > the yuba , i 'm going < i > up. < /i > do you honestly think for one minute i 'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents ... do you ?
truman , stop it !
no . you said , `` do something . '' who were you talking to ? tell me !
you 're the one talking to the walls !
who were you talking to ? !
do something ...
stop this now . i 'll do it . i swear .
you 're part of this , are n't you ? !
you 're having a nervous breakdown , that 's what 's happening .
what the hell has that got to do with anything ? tell me what 's happening ? !
i 've tasted other cocoas . this is the best .
-- what the hell are you talking about ? !
why do n't i make you some of this new mococoa drink ? all natural . cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua . no artificial sweeteners --
that 's not true .
why do you want to have a child with me ? you ca n't stand me .
let me get you some help , truman . you 're not well .
so we just eat into our savings , is that the idea ? i 'd better call your mother when we get there . she 'll be worried sick - i do n't know how she 's going to take this .
i 've got my seahaven bankcard .
so what do we do for money when we get to new orleans ?
i 'm sure they 're just exaggerating .
truman , what about that sign ?
i bet you did .
truman , i took the `` hypocrite '' oath !
uhuh . there 's no accident . it 's just more stalling .
there 's been an accident , truman .
it 's hard to go places , is n't it ?
i think i 'd like a little company .
let me out , truman . you 're not right in the head . you want to destroy yourself , you do it on your own !
i 've changed my mind again . what 's new orleans like this time of year ? mardi gras . or let 's just see where the road takes us .
truman , that was our house !
should i ?
you blaming me for the traffic ?
blocked at every turn . beautifully synchronized , do n't you agree ?
truman , i think i 'm going to throw up .
because i never have . that 's why you go places , is n't it ?
so why do you want to go ?
that 's right . i do , do n't i ?
you hate gambling .
where shall we go ? where shall we go ? spontaneity is what it 's all about . forget fiji . we ca n't very well drive to fiji , can we ? what about atlantic city ?
what ? !
let 's go now .
you 're upset because you want to go to fiji . is that it ?
are you listening to a word i 'm saying ?
-- we need more charcoal .
i wo n't be here sunday .
i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque sunday . i thought i 'd make my potato salad . remind me --
put some butter on it -- or ice ?
-- you 're a nurse , are n't you ?
i do n't know --
what do i do ?
oh , my god !
arrah !
surgery . the elevator disaster downtown on the news last night . cable snapped , a car dropped ten floors . non-union contractors . monsters . we 're starting with an amputation .
what 's the hurry ?
i 'm sorry , i 'm late .
i have to talk with you . but not here . let 's go for a walk .
see you in a minute , sweetheart .
good night , mother .
i 'll take you home , angela . why do n't you leave those with us for a while ?
i still want to look over a couple of things .
come on , truman . have n't you studied enough ?
i 'm not hungry .
i made macaroni .
what did you want ?
your mother called . you should n't upset her like that .
how do you know ?
i know .
fixing the mower . i saw my father today .
what 're you doing down here ?
i think i 'm going to stay up for a while .
this 'll pass . everybody thinks like this now and then . come to bed .
that can wait . i want to get away . see some of the world . explore .
i thought we were going to try for a baby . is n't that enough of an adventure ?
it 'd be an adventure .
we 're mortgaged to the eyeballs , truman . there 's the car payments . are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations ?
maybe i feel like a teenager .
and then what , truman ? we 'd be back to where we were five years ago . you 're talking like a teenager .
-- we could bum around the world for a year on that .
every time you and marlon --
-- i figure we could scrape together eight thousand .
oh , god .
i 've been thinking --
where have you been ?
did something happen today ?
i wo n't be late .
i was hoping we could have a special evening .
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw . we got three of his fingers back on .
how did it go today ?
gee , that 's great .
hi , honey . look at this . it 's a `` chef's-mate . '' dicer , slicer and peeler in one . never needs sharpening . dishwasher safe .
they 're ... perfect . thank you .
well , what do you think ?
it 's a surprise .
what 's that ?
truman , you 're gon na be late !
... personally i think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling ... of course it 's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before ? ... naturally , i intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick ... < i > risks ? < /i > ... ... sure i 'm aware of the risks -- why else do you think i would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company ... ?
things always do -- when you look back .
it looks so small .
hold on a minute , dear . here 's us at mount rushmore . you remember , truman -- when dad was still with us - that was quite a drive . you slept all the way there .
we ought to be getting you back , mother .
you know he was an only child , like you . i know how bad you feel about what happened -- sailing into that storm . but i do n't blame you , truman . i never have .
i 'm telling you , if it was n't him , it was his twin . did dad have a brother ?
-- darling --
they never found dad 's body -- maybe somehow --
about time they started cleaning up the trash downtown . we do n't want to end up like the rest of the country .
it was dad , i swear , dressed like a homeless man . and you know what else was really strange ? a businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus .
it does n't sound insane , truman . i swear i see him ten times a week -- in a hundred faces . i almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last thursday .
i feel certain my condition runs in the family . ca n't this wait , dear ?
i spend half my life out in the sun , mother , why would i need vitamin d ?
you look very pale , truman . are you taking your vitamin d 's ?
i 've got something to tell you . you 'd better sit down .
you know surprises are n't good for me . you should really call before you come over , dear .
oh , just so .
how 's your hip ?
well , i made it through another night .
how are you , mother ?
fine . i 'll tell her .
you got it .
when you get to fiji ?
tell her , tell her ... i had to go to fiji . i 'll call her when i get there .
i 'll try .
sure . okay . fine . can you pass on a message ?
i 'm afraid that 's impossible -- she 's in pre-op .
i 'm looking for my wife -- nurse burbank . it 's important .
you 're welcome , truman .
well , thank you for your help .
the whole area 's being evacuated .
is there any way around ?
leak at the plant . they had to shut her down .
now what ?
you must listen . everybody 's pretending , truman .
i do n't understand .
-- it does n't matter . everybody knows about it . they know everything you do . the point is , you got scared .
were you there -- how do you know ?
-- and your teacher said , `` you 're too late , truman . there 's nothing left to explore . ''
-- how do you know about that ?
just listen . you remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan --
there 's no one here .
they 're going to stop me talking to you .
who ?
they 're coming . any minute .
you can count on it .
see you tomorrow , truman .
i 'd ask for identification .
tyrone , what if i said i did n't want meatball today ?
good . good .
not bad . i just won the state lottery .
how 's it going , truman ?
you 're not fbi agents .
well , we 're fbi agents .
we do n't even know you .
i think you better tell us .
you 're not supposed to talk about it ? who told you that ?
not supposed to talk about it .
yeah .
do you live around here ?
sorry . do n't have one .
why do n't you go home to the old lady --
does what ?
i think that about does it , spooky .
what do i do . i 'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade . an annoyance to my superiors . a joke among my peers . `` spooky , '' they call me . spooky mulder . whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid . who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens and anyone who 'll listen that the fix is in . that our government 's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy . that the sky is falling and when it hits it 's gon na be the shitstorm of all time .
what do you do ?
a woman ? work .
yup .
poopy day ?
me ?
i need your clothes , byers .
they took her --
you called 911. except the call was intercepted .
scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
when was that ?
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma . but you 've been unconscious since they brought you in .
penetration but not perforation .
you were shot in the head . the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate .
what am i doing here ?
most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive . i realize you 're very lucky to be alive agent scully . the ordeal you 've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department . until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation .
no , they do n't .
well ... where would you like me to start ? antarctica is a long way from dallas , agent scully . i ca n't very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you 've made here . bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism .
what is it you find incredible ?
agent mulder .
working with ?
i hope to . we 're working to develop this evidence --
nothing completely conclusive --
and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
yes . i know .
-- those are very serious allegations , agent scully --
that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the reason for them would n't have to be explained --
are you going to let us in on what exactly you 're trying to prove --
yes .
you 've been back to dallas ?
evidence of what ?
i apologize for making you wait -- i 've brought some new evidence with me --
special agent scully --
they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus . you 'll make sure the families are taken care of financially , along with a sizeable donation to the community . maybe a small roadside memorial .
of what ?
tell them he was trying to save the young boy 's life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .
this man 's family will want to see the body laid to rest .
incinerate it . like the others .
and if it 's unsuccessful ?
no . no ... we need to try our vaccine on it .
do you want me to destroy this one , too ? before it gestates ?
the developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . we 've just slowed the process .
how can this be ?
technically and biologically , though he 'll never recover .
this man 's still alive .
heat , i think . the coincident invasion of a host , the fireman , and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six .
brought on by what ?
we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development , which is nothing like we 've ever seen .
yes .
you 've got something to show me .
kurtzweil , we think .
who ?
mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence . he 's gone back there again . someone has tipped him .
do they know ?
there are complications .
my lateness may have well been absence . a course has already been taken .
into what ?
its effect on the host has changed . the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism . it 's developed a way to modify the host body .
strughold . he 's just gotten on a plane in tunis .
who called this meeting ?
is it an emergency ?
we have a situation . the members are assembling .
yes .
no . do n't bother .
you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil ?
yeah , i had an appointment for a pelvic examination .
you looking for him for some other reason ?
selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer .
what 's that ?
feds are looking for him , too . real nice business he 's got , huh ?
looking for him for what ?
i 'm looking for him .
you got some kind of business with him ?
is this dr. kurtzweil 's residence ?
show you right on a map .
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found .
no . just fossils , far as i know .
have you examined them ?
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . we thought there 'd been another fatality , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
was there anything in those offices that did n't go to d.c. ?
we were n't expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington .
i 'm looking for anything out of the ordinary . maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found .
and why do you think it is you 're standing here talking to me ? these people do n't make mistakes , agent mulder .
your ass ? i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters .
you 'd be shit out of luck if not for me . you saw what you saw because i led you to it . i 'm putting my ass on the line for you .
you 're a liar . you lied to me to gather information for you . for your goddamn books . did n't you ?
i told you -- he and i were old friends --
you did n't know my father --
i 've been using you ? !
you 've been using me --
yeah , well i do n't have them all .
you told me you had answers .
your guess ?
that would be my guess .
a transportation system . transgenic crops . the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus .
what do you think ?
what did it look like ?
-- you saw this experiment ?
i 'm not sure . a virus --
what ?
yes . on the texas border . some kind of experiment . something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks .
you found something ?
you ca n't .
how can i reach you ?
something 's gone wrong -- something unanticipated . go back to dallas and dig . or you 're only going to find out like the rest of the country , agent mulder . when it 's too late .
and they tell me i 'm paranoid .
i think you know . the timetable has been set . it will happen on a holiday , when people are away from their homes . when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country . the president will declare a state of emergency , at which time all federal agencies , all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency . fema , agent mulder . the secret government .
negotiating with whom ?
the plague to end all plagues , agent mulder . a silent weapon for a quiet war . the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . they 've been working on this for fifty years . while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon .
a plague ?
what killed those men ca n't be identified in simple medical terms . my god , we ca n't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv . we have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved .
i 'll know soon enough .
what killed them i wo n't even write about . i tell you , they 'd do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
what killed those men ?
when we were young men in the military , your father and i were recruited for a project . they told us it was biological warfare . a virus . there were rumors about its origins .
what was it ?
are you saying it was n't such a small outbreak ?
and are you familiar with fema ? what the federal emergency management agency 's real power is ? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . to create a non-elected government . think about that . what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas ?
it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u.s. several years ago .
according to the newspaper , fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus . are you familiar with the hanta virus , agent mulder ?
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency . why ?
i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government . the daily newspaper .
how ?
i was right about dallas . was n't i , agent mulder ?
i do n't either , but it sure sells books .
dr. kurtzweil , i 'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide . i do n't believe in the elders of zion , the knights templar , the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
you know my work ?
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar . i just did n't know why .
for what ? because i 'm a dangerous man . because i know too much about the truth .
they want to discredit you -- for what ?
what is it ? kiddie porn again ? sexual battery of a patient ? i 've had my license taken away in three states .
not according to the men in blue .
see this bullshit ... ? somebody knows i 'm talking to you .
do you ?
i think you 're full of shit .
and one little boy .
you 're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen ... ?
michaud was a patriot . the men he 's loyal to know their way around dallas . they blew that building to hide something . maybe something even they could n't predict .
michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
that 's what i 'm saying .
before the bomb went off ?
those people were already dead .
no . they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices . the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there . which is where the bodies were found . but that 's the thing ...
the federal building was too well guarded .
what 's the question nobody 's asking ? why that building ? why not the federal building ?
he just let it explode .
s.a.c . darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb .
and what 's that ?
well , if you 've got something to tell me , you 've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab ...
i came on my own . after reading about the bombing in dallas .
who sent you ?
i 'm a doctor , but i think i mentioned that . ob-gyn .
you a reporter ?
heard you come here now and again . figured you 'd be needing a little drinky tonight .
how 'd you find me ?
old friend of your father 's .
i know the name . why ?
my name 's kurtzweil . dr. alvin kurtzweil .
yeah , i did .
you follow me out here for a reason ?
no . i 've been watching your career for a good while . back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that .
do i know you ?
standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding .
how 's that ?
yes you can . you 're going to make it , scully .
i ca n't go any farther .
you got me . but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa .
where are we ?
we 've got to keep moving .
hang on . i 'm going to get you out of here .
cold ...
i 've got no allergy . something ... this ... mulder ... i think ... i think you should call an ambulance .
scully --
no -- it 's --
i think you 're in anaphylactic shock --
... my pulse feels thready and i 've got a funny taste in the back of my throat .
something 's wrong ... i 'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest . my ... motor functions are being affected . i 'm ...
scully ...
i think ... something stung me .
what ? what happened ?
you saved me , scully . as different and frustrating as it 's been sometimes , your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times ; have kept me honest and made me whole . i owe you so much , scully , and you owe me nothing . i do n't want to do this without you . i do n't know if i can . if i quit now , they win .
why was i assigned to you ? to debunk your work . to reign you in . to shut you down .
you do n't mulder -- you 've never needed me . i 've only held you back . i 've got to go .
i need you on this , scully --
i 'm contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
just like that --
i have . i did . it 's done .
after what you saw last night -- after all you 've seen -- you ca n't just walk away --
you 're on the verge , mulder -- please do n't do this to me --
we 're close to something here -- we 're on the verge --
i can , mulder . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --
you ca n't quit , scully .
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation .
salt lake city , utah . transfer effective immediately .
what ? what 's wrong ?
i do n't know .
where 'd they go ?
come on !
what are you doing ?
run .
yeah ... ?
scully ... . ?
maybe . maybe not .
i hear the humming . like electricity . high voltage maybe .
you hear that ?
for the purpose of what ?
cool in here . temperature 's being regulated .
not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there .
any thoughts on why anybody 'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert ?
very weird .
this is weird , mulder .
i have no idea .
what do you think it is ?
pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night . chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope , only to find myself standing right where i am right now : at another dead end --
been where ?
i do n't believe this . i do n't fucking believe this . y'know , i 've been here ... i 've been here one too many times with you , mulder .
it may be extraterrestrial .
mulder --
this virus -- it ...
what do you mean by haul ? what are you not telling me here ?
yeah , well they may this one .
they haul gas in tanker trucks , they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they do n't haul viruses in tanker trucks .
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off , to hide something : bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself .
-- of what exactly ? !
we 're not chasing trucks , we 're chasing evidence --
i 've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life . and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas , chasing phantom tanker trucks .
what ?
this is great . this is fitting .
hey , i was right about the bomb , was n't i ?
i do n't know why i think they went right .
you think they went left ?
we 've got two choices . one of them is wrong .
where would they be going ?
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction .
what are my choices ?
that 's the first question to answer , if we 're going to find them .
and where are they going with it ?
i do n't know , mulder .
unmarked tanker trucks ... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks ?
no irrigation system . somebody 's covering their tracks .
all the equipment is brand new .
ground 's dry about an inch down . somebody just laid this down . very recently , i 'd say .
it looks pretty green for this climate .
this looks like new grass to you ?
no . it did n't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
and you 've never seen anything like that ?
the bone was porous , as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it .
you 're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman 's body in the morgue ?
i do n't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . not even a sewer or a storm drain .
this is where he marked on the map , scully . where he says those fossils were unearthed .
he did n't mention a park .
that i do n't know . but if it 's through simple contact of blood to blood , and if it does n't respond to conventional treatments , it could be a serious health threat .
how was it contracted ?
something i could n't show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i 'd just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i 've never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
what did you find ?
i was n't planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen .
you said you were n't coming ?
mulder -- i ca n't -- i 'm already way past the point of common sense here --
-- i 'll have you back for it , scully . maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away .
i 've got a hearing tomorrow --
i need you there with me . i need your expertise on this . the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by .
mulder --
scully -- listen to me . i 'm going home , then i 'm booking a flight to dallas . i 'm getting you a ticket , too .
i do n't know .
what kind of infection ?
evidence of a massive infection .
what did you find ?
i ca n't really talk right now .
why are you whispering ?
we 're being blamed for these deaths . scully , i want to know what this man died of . do n't you ?
mulder , this is going to take some time , and somebody 's going to figure out soon enough we 're not even supposed to be here . i 'm in serious violation of medical ethics .
i do n't know . but i have a hunch what you 're going to find here is n't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .
you 're saying the bombing was a cover-up . of what ?
i 'd been told as much .
you knew this man did n't die at the bomb site before we got here .
i do n't know what killed this man . i 'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either .
you 're telling me the cause of death on the report is false . that this man did n't die from an explosion , or from flying debris .
and there 's been no autopsy performed . there 's no y incision here ; no internal exam .
there 's some kind of cellular breakdown . it 's completely edematous .
it 's like jelly .
and you 're looking for ?
according to this tag .
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas ?
just get dressed . i 'll explain on the way .
mulder -- what are you doing ?
get dressed , scully .
go home , mulder . it 's late .
is that what you 'd like me to do ?
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .
what are you implying , scully ?
is that before or after you got the idea to come here ?
i was until about an hour ago .
are you drunk , mulder ?
why not ? it 's three am .
no .
i wake you ?
there 's really no reason left for me to stay anymore . maybe you should ask yourself if your heart 's still in it , too .
you 're ... quitting ?
they 're not doing this , mulder . i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi . when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau . i felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . but it has n't turned out that way . and now , if i were to be transferred to omaha , or wichita or some field office where i 'm sure i could rise , it just does n't hold the interest for me it once did . not after what i 've seen and done .
this is n't about you , scully . they 're doing this to me .
because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
they were the ones that put us together .
i think you must have an idea . they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993 .
why ?
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment ...
what ? what are you talking about ?
they have divided us , mulder . they 're splitting us up .
they 're trying to divide us on this , scully . we ca n't let them .
all i told them was the truth .
whatever you told them in there , you do n't have to protect me .
-- mulder ! get in the car !
something 's not right ...
mulder . move away from the door . we 're coming through it .
scully ?
hang on . i 'm gon na get you out of there .
... thirteen fifty six ...
thirteen fifty nine , thirteen fifty eight , thirteen fifty seven ...
mulder ? tell me this is a joke .
nice try , mulder .
scully , get somebody to open this door .
i 'm in the vending room .
where are you , mulder ?
scully , i found the bomb .
scully ...
something sweet .
alright ... what 'll it be : coke , pepsi ? a saline iv ?
i just did . you 're buying .
panic ? have you ever seen me panic , scully ?
i saw your face , mulder . there was a moment of panic .
oh yeah . had you big time .
no you did n't .
had you .
it 's locked ?
now what ?
what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston . i think it 's free beer night at the astrodome .
you 've got to quit looking for what is n't there . they 've closed the x-files . there 's procedure to be followed here . protocol .
how 's that ?
i know you 're bored in this assignment , but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now .
the element of surprise , scully . random acts of unpredictability . if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities , we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that can not be programmed , categorized or easily referenced ...
jesus , mulder ...
what happened to playing a hunch ?
mulder ... ?
mulder ... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in , the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb . the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror . if you 'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device . if we do n't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it . lives could be lost --
i think they have that covered .
i know that . but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street .
you 're looking for a bomb .
i 've just climbed twelve floors . i 'm hot and thirsty and i 'm wondering , to be honest , what i 'm doing here .
what 's wrong , scully ?
no . i have n't .
did you find something ?
i 'm on the roof .
where are you , scully ?
mulder -- it 's me --
thank you .
why do n't you go on ahead head and i 'll confirm authorization .
they can patch you in through the switchboard .
i do n't have his number .
well , call general mcaddie .
i do n't know anything about that .
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here . we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately .
general mcaddie 's .
on whose orders ?
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel .
we 're going to the morgue .
i 've got to find scully .
what are you doing ?
i 'm not taking any chances .
are we being watched ?
i do n't know .
how deep does this go ?
i know . agent scully reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s.a.c . michaud 's apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
she 's missing . we 've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in .
where 's scully ? !
agent mulder --
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building . that you wanted to go back .
i breached protocol . i broke contact with the s.a.c . i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
she 's in there right now saying the same thing about you .
-- if they want someone to blame , they can blame me . agent scully does n't deserve this .
-- if it looks bad , it 's bad for the fbi --
but it 's not the lives we saved . it 's the lives we did n't .
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and agent scully had n't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
and they want to blame us ?
you do n't see what 's going on here , do you ? there 's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas . lives have been lost . no suspects have been named . so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . that the fbi did n't do its job .
she was with me .
-- they 're asking her for a narrative . they want to know why she was in the wrong building .
about what ?
sit down , they 're still talking to agent scully .
my life is over . go .
what about you ?
find agent scully . save her . only her science can save the future .
what alien environment ?
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we 've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .
how ?
you have precious little time . what i 've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists . you hold in your hand the power to end the project .
driver .
let me out . stop the car .
dr. kurtzweil is in the trunk .
where is he ?
as your father knew , things need to be sacrificed to the future .
what happened to kurtzweil ?
i thought it only fair you should know , given how hard you 've worked .
why are you telling me this ?
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it : those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids . your father arranged for your sister 's abduction . he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program , so that she would survive . as a clone . he had different hopes for you . that you would uncover the truth about the project . that you would stop it . that you would fight the future .
but ... he sacrificed his own daughter . my sister , samantha .
imagine our surprise when they began to gestate . my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists , facilitating their programs . to give us access to the virus . in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure . so that we might save ourselves , as the last of the species . your father wisely refused to believe this , choosing hope over selfishness . hope is the only future he had : his children , the only future any of us have .
that 's why you bombed the building . the infected firemen , the boy --
until dallas , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
your aliens , agent mulder , your little green men , first landed here millions of years ago . those that did n't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age . in the form of an evolved pathogen . waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet . using us as hosts . against this we have no defense . nothing but a weak vaccine . do you see why it was kept secret ? why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known ?
what do you mean , walked ?
aids , the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns . this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs .
no ! for god sake you 've got it all backwards .
this is what you 've been conspiring to conceal ? a disease ?
a simple , unstoppable lifeform . what is a virus but a colonizing force that can not be defeated ? living in a cave , underground , until it mutates . and attacks .
a virus ?
no . though i have no way to prove otherwise . the virus is extraterrestrial . we know very little about it , except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet .
you 're lying .
a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with . it must be administered with ninety six hours .
what is it ?
i want to know where scully is .
i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .
about the conspiracy ?
i 'm quite prepared to tell you everything , though there is n't much you have n't guessed .
yes .
is she alive ?
i have answers for you .
where 's scully ?
he 's come and gone .
what happened to kurtzweil ?
mr. mulder .
no , you need only take away what is most precious to him .
you need not kill a man to destroy him .
you ca n't kill mulder . he 's got too much light on him .
and mulder ?
no one believes kurtzweil or his books . he 's a toiler . a crank .
we 've allowed this man his freedom . his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial . has he outlived his usefulness to us ?
well , without a cure for the virus , we 're nothing more than digestives anyway .
our vaccine may have no effect !
cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves .
and if it does n't ? by cooperating now we 're but beggars to our demise ! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all .
let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable . to start colonization early .
in hope of what ? learning that it 's true ? ! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? !
we 're going to tell them what we 've found . what we 've learned . turn over a body infected with the gestating organism .
this is n't colonization , it 's spontaneous repopulation . all our work ... if it 's true , then they 've been using us all along . we 've been laboring under a lie !
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization .
my god ...
we 've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves .
more concerns than that ?
i 'm sorry . my grandson fell and broke his leg .
we began to worry . some of us have traveled so far , and you are the last to arrive .
give a kiss to edward .
... give a kiss to edward .
thanks miriam . say hi to henry and ...
i 'll come by tomorrow after work . with dinner .
i know .
i do n't need them anymore ...
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan ...
agent novak . i did n't get a chance to clear him .
what 's wrong ?
damn him .
baked in a pie .
four and twenty blackbirds ...
... a pocketful of rye .
what happened ?
is it cold in here ?
no . no .
catherine ? i 'm about to start . if you want me to wait , or ...
she said convincingly .
i 'll be fine .
this is n't your responsibility . remember that . do n't let them use guilt as a tool . if you want to stop , say so .
he needs to be turned over .
like a new year 's day hangover .
disorientation , nausea , migraines , hallucinations , insomnia , paranoia .
the first ... what ? six or seven times i went in . remember what happened ?
why did we stop ?
nothing .
a pocketful of fucking rye . what 's wrong ?
sing a song of sixpence .
that 's my girl .
i 've got to feed my cat . besides , i want to get to bed early .
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he 's wild about . want to come ?
okay .
do n't bring it home in this .
i do n't want you up all night reading edward 's case file of the nine millionth time . balance , dear girl , is the key . leave the work here .
yes mother .
good . we need you healthy and relaxed . you 're going to eat well , meditate , exercise , and watch mindless television .
no .
you 're sure ? any more nightmares ?
okay , okay ...
and he might blame you for terrifying him . that one moment could erase all you 've accomplished . and if that happened , the trust he has in you is gone .
i 'd be there for him .
yes , but , you 're a willing participant . picture edward in a strange place , lost , frightened ...
i do it all the time !
if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind , it could be devastating for him . imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world .
it could take years for me to get past the barriers he 's created .
i 've heard this argument before . it 's not happening .
he creates the obstacles , he decides which games to play .
shush .
miriam ...
i do n't want to find out .
why not ? just once . a trial run . what harm could it do ?
we 've been over this a dozen times . no .
someday you can . we all believe that ...
she thinks i can bring edward back .
she adores you .
lucien baines ?
he hates me .
mocky-lock is a pain in the ass .
`` mocky-lock is the bogeyman , mocky-lock wants me where i am . ''
almost . mocky-lock showed up .
did we go sailing ?
four-and-twenty blackbirds .
a pocketful of rye ...
sing a song of sixpence ...
no . thank you .
no problem .
thank you .
i got it .
they 're hungry .
i do n't know . i think it does . you know , catherine ... if you ever want to talk about it . what happened to stargher . that last time .
it does n't matter ...
he also says that until proven differently , julia hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work .
all yours . my boss says it 's one of the strangest requests the bureau 's ever had .
he 's mine ?
so you say .
i told you . you have to be optimistic . believe in them ...
well look at that .
good for them .
yep . eloped .
i heard julia and john got married .
absolutely . abigail ...
you sure about this ?
give her a minute . hello , valentine .
that went well .
i ca n't leave him !
come on !
carl , do you know ? like on a map ...
where the hell are we ?
he brought you to me , did n't he ? if you want julia to live , trust me . trust him .
little boy ? ! that 's him !
he wants us to follow . the little boy ...
like hell `` wait . ''
wait ...
okay , okay ...
remember , julia hickson is priority number one . nothing else matters . find out where she is .
yes . i am .
you 're sure of that ?
a child can experience abuse worse than charlie 's . and grow up to be someone who would never , ever hurt another living thing .
tell me .
what difference does it make ... ?
what happened ?
what happened to charles gish ?
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time .
if you believe that .
evil .
then what is he ?
it 's hard for me to see stargher as human , capable of something like `` remorse . ''
do n't you feel there are different sides to every personality ? maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act . we 're all human .
whoa . hold on . are n't they the same guy ?
not stargher , not really . he 's split himself right down the middle . good/evil , right/wrong , merciful/cruel . a monster . and an innocent child . if i could reach the boy .
this is stargher we 're talking about ?
he might tell me about julia . the part of him that wants to help , that feels shame and remorse . who wants to be redeemed .
you think you can do this , do n't you ?
this is going to sound terrible , but ... i do n't think she matters anymore . not to him . he never finished her . the others ... he was able to make them his .
what about julia ?
you were right . there 's a part of him that knows the truth . about what he did , about himself .
i did , yeah .
you thought stargher wanted to be caught .
as soon as i met him , you knew i 'd say yes . he makes julia real for me .
you 're the shrink , you tell me .
why 'd you bring him here ?
a kingdom . his utopia . life without consequence or restriction . he 's not even carl stargher anymore . he 's this ... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases ... without fear . a horrible primitive ugly thing . i do n't want to talk in here .
what did you see ?
with stargher i saw things ...
that 's what therapists are for , right ?
just like we all have fantasies , right ? things only we know , that we do n't share .
absolutely . i suppose everyone does .
do you feel there 's a side of yourself you do n't show people ?
peter , okay ?
agent novak ?
ah , the part of us that ca n't be explained .
the soul . the spirit . whatever you want to call it .
what then ?
it does n't have much to do with science .
i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years . every time her husband came to visit , her heart would beat faster . is n't that something ? i do n't know what name scientists have for something like that ...
no . not at all . from what i understand , he knows i '' m here , is n't that right ?
do you think that 's funny ?
edward baines , i presume . hi , ed . i 'm pete .
i know him .
you do n't know the procedure .
this man is deeply disturbed , he ...
how hard could it be ... ?
i realize that ...
i still do n't understand why i ca n't do this ... this is n't some `` troubled kid '' you 're dealing with .
okay . let 's assume he wanted you to find him , that some part of him hated what he was doing ... most likely , that part is dead . schizophrenics with whalen 's infraction sever all ties with the real world . i 'm sorry , i really am .
sometimes ... once they 've been caught they feel a need for disclosure . they have so much they want to tell . but they 've never had a sympathetic ear . they need someone to understand why . stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully . it was part of the ritual . some were n't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean . but these last three ... they were still in water - always in water - but listen , he was n't just careless . it went beyond that ...
really ? i do n't work with violent cases , i work with children . but even a kid lies . they love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true . do n't you think stargher would do the same ?
there 's always a chance they 'll confess .
as far as i needed .
what if he was n't like this ? what if he was `` normal ? '' conscious . how far would you go ?
i bet we can fix it .
`` mocky-lock is the bogeyman . mocky-lock wants me where i am . ''
oh no ... no you do n't .
mocky-lock .
who says ?
's broken .
what now ?
he 's beautiful ...
you liked him ?
i never kid . my wife hates it . says i 'm too serious .
you 're kidding me .
yep . and guess who they hired to seal up the place ?
delano ?
lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near delano . bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it 's just sitting there .
that hoist , with the winch ...
already there .
i need you to find something in the basement ...
agent cole .
just graduated law school . single mom . had a two-year-old daughter .
she the one from santa cruz ?
she 's bringing stargher into hers .
instead of going into his mind ...
it would take hours to re-route the system , and even if i did , i should n't .
what 's wrong ?
she changed the codes .
i think that 's the whole point .
i hate to admit it , but there 's something perversely satisfying about this .
pump in two liters of pure oxygen , please henry .
that 's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely . we do n't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation .
initiating connection .
intravenous administration complete .
catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy . when we started , there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as `` receivers . '' all they did was observe and report . nothing more . but catherine , she had the ability to feel what was happening . she understood . and the patient responded . edward engaged her in dialogue , took her places , showed her things . he knew she cared .
not a gift . a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex , that 's all . a genetic fluke .
they took care of that , thank you , henry .
should n't we get a catheter in him ?
completely unaware .
what about the cat ?
awaiting his arrival .
how 's the patient .
federal bureau of investigation , ma'am . we know all , see all ...
that 's a secret .
thanks you . six weeks off does a body good . i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward .
you 're looking well .
dr. kent .
agent novak .
yes . but you 're going to sit down right now . i have to ...
is she alright ?
i doubt that .
i am . i 'm a pretty boring guy .
i know your partner 's here , but it 's very important that you 're honest .
no .
what about narcotics ?
no .
any psychiatric medication ?
prevacid . for my stomach .
i have to ask you some things ... are you taking any prescription drugs ?
absolutely .
nervous ?
no .
i have done this , you know . been inside .
yes .
into stargher . inside ...
that was with edward . she 's accustomed to his world . stargher 's mind is unfamiliar territory . she 's `` lost . '' someone has to go in . remind her what 's really happening . and get her out . until then , she 's at his mercy .
when we got here , you just topped and pulled her out .
i 'll get her ...
catherine !
stargher is in custody . the functional equivalent of being under arrest . normally , we 'd mirandize him , and if he did n't lawyer up , we 'd interrogate him . but because of his condition , he does n't have the capacity to waive those rights .
what about the legalities of this ... ?
sometime yesterday morning .
when did he lapse into the coma ?
it 's his dog .
the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago . and we got the match .
gentlemen , i believe an albino dog is rare indeed .
the dog 's an albino . he 'd love an animal like that .
now .
now ?
i need it .
anne vicksey did n't own a dog .
so ?
grandparents . live over in davis .
someone looking after her little girl ?
you might 've seen jimmy hoffa dancing with timothy leary . i do n't care .
i saw her . julia . alive . i saw everything .
you 're bettin ' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit ?
considering where i 've been ...
jesus christ , man , you look like hell .
but you looked so cute . all sleepy ...
next time , tell me , okay ?
right here .
that 's not what i 'm talking about , pete . i 'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl 's gon na die .
tell you what . if this thing burns us , i take that heat . i give you permission to point your finger at me and say `` it was all his idea . ''
why jeopardize what we 've already done ? we caught the sonofabitch . carl stargher . that 's going to be like bundy , gacy , dahmer . a case that makes careers . but if we push our luck . if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it .
i do n't have to .
i do n't know , pete , but for god 's sake ... this is nuts . do you really understand what they 're going to do ?
what else do we do ? !
you sure you want to go through with this ?
they 're in that fucking thing for forty hours , gordon . four-oh . he got julia at seven-thirty last night . you know what time it is now ... ? !
we 'll go back to his house , pete . there 's still a lot to do . analyze the videos , track sales of the bleach , go through his records . maybe he owns property somewhere .
no . can you get a man close ?
let 's give old carl a call . tell him he 's got company .
we proceed assuming she is .
she remembers because it was her `` dream truck . '' wanted one just like it .
after three years she remembers what the guy drove ?
nicole labetzki . victim seven . forensics found dog hair in her car , but they had a k-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked .
breeders typically destroy albino pups , so this animal is truly unique .
damn , man , i give up . your partner tells you his wife 's gon na have a baby , and all you care about is a coroner 's report !
here he is .
pregnant . thanks for asking .
how is she ?
they think you did it .
warscheinlich ist der murder .
das worren nooh zeiten .
give her some cigarettes .
hier sind fruher fursten ans unt eingeganger . hier hat sogar ein metternich verkehrt ...
sayen sie ed our den leuten damit sie es auch wissen .
ja , ja , ja .
den leuten .
das mussen sie doch wissen . ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins hans komme fraulein schmidt , ein schande ...
ich weiss nicht .
from kurtz . they have just been arrested . but harry wo n't come , he 's not a fool .
... anyway ?
if you want to sell your service , i 'm not willing to be the price ... i loved him . you loved him . what good have we done him . look at yourself , they have names for faces like that .
... quarrel ?
we 're getting you out of here , are n't we ?
why are you lying ?
oh , well .
his .
that 's his headache .
why should he help me like that ? the russians will only make trouble for him .
of course i did n't tell calloway .
there 's something wrong . did you tell calloway about meeting harry ?
oh , the usual things ...
did he say anything about me - tell me ?
i saw him today .
how do you know ?
he 's safe in the russian zone .
what is going to happen ? where is harry ?
you send me a wire as soon as you arrive .
i shall be all right .
here , it will be cold on that train .
hide ? ca n't a fellow have a drink ?
what is on your mind ? why did you hide ?
i 'm sorry .
harry .
have you been seeing major calloway again ?
... headquarters .
how did you know i would be here ?
... is there ?
oh ...
are you going , too ?
there is n't enough for two laughs .
... again .
well , do n't preach wisdom to me . you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners .
... and my lover . he was harry .
i 'll put these flowers in water .
seventy pounds a tube . he wanted me to write for his great medical charity .
he liked to laugh .
i knew him for twenty years - at least i thought i knew him . i suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time .
he 's better dead . i know he was mixed up - but not like that .
he told you , did n't he ?
... you know .
have you ?
can you imagine a parrot nipping a man ?
have you seen calloway ?
a parrot ... let it go .
what happened to your hand ?
why ?
i 'm going back home .
i do n't know .
i thought you were going to go away . are n't the police after you ?
me .
wer ist da ?
be sensible - tell major calloway .
i wish i knew .
what are you going to do ?
sneak out the other way , and go back to your theatre . i 'd better not see you again .
wait here .
let 's not get into any more trouble .
what 's the matter ?
let 's go away .
yes .
that 's harry 's place , is n't it ?
it 's all right .
i 'm so sorry .
holly .
we 're both in it , harry .
a moment ago you said you did n't want to see the porter .
i thought you wanted ...
what 's the hurry ? ca n't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes ?
if we have to see the porter we 'd better go .
well , i did n't learn that from him .
it 's just what he used to say .
seemed like a good idea .
anna .
... and buried him .
oh , it 's very difficult . you know harry ... we did n't do ...
tell me more .
oh , that was many years ago .
where is she ?
... to steal my girl .
oh , we did n't make much sense . drank too much . once he tried ...
when ... what did you do ?
tell you what ?
tell me about him .
oh , let me see . no , no that 's not the cue . it means she has to sit down .
h-e-z-t ...
`` ein hurigan '' - i guess .
what 's that ?
gestern bein heurigen ...
well you read this .
do i ...
comedy . i do n't play tragedy .
i can try . is it comedy , or tragedy ?
in german ?
can i hear you ?
just another part i 've got to learn .
might as well i suppose . are you busy ?
need we go through it all again ?
the porter is going to talk to us tonight .
silly looking bunch .
sssh . do n't . do n't , please .
who are you looking for now ?
yes . he moved his head , but the rest is good , is n't it ?
harry ?
whiskey .
drink ?
dr. winkel .
oh , what was the name of that doctor ? harry 's doctor ?
the russians would claim me . i come from czechoslovakia .
why ?
they 're forged .
anything really wrong with your papers ?
the police . they 're searching my room . sie mussen doch wissen .
what 's she talking about ?
why do n't you leave this town - go home ?
well , if i do find out something , can i look you up again ?
you should n't get mixed up in this .
i was told there were only two men there .
i do n't know . they did n't answer .
i know . i wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident .
... at all .
mmmm .
he was harry 's driver ?
yes . they said it was n't the driver 's fault . harry often said what a careful driver he was .
were you at the inquest ?
yes .
his own doctor ?
the doctor harry used to go to . he was passing just after it happened .
dr. winkel ? who is he ?
dr. winkel told me that .
he said he remembered me too . seems to show he was n't in much pain .
that was the man that brought me some money when harry died . he said harry had been anxious at the last moment .
do n't understand what harry saw in a fellow like that .
oh , yes , yes .
he has a little dog .
no .
i was talking to another friend of harry 's . a baron kurtz - do you know him ?
oh , american , thank you . i like them .
i do n't know . how can you know a thing like that afterwards . i do n't know anything any more .
you were in love with him , were n't you ?
i 'm so sorry , i did n't notice much .
well , i saw you at the funeral .
no , he never told me about his friends . would you like some tea ?
but i could follow it fine . perhaps harry told you about me . my name 's holly martins .
no , no ... oh ... excuse me .
do you understand german ?
you were awfully good .
thank you . i enjoyed the play very much .
sit down .
thank you .
entschuldigen sie . it was a terrible thing .
nichts danke . kein .
keep the packet .
thank you .
cigarette , miss schmidt ?
i helped harry fix her papers , mr. martins ...
of course .
good evening , miss schmidt . you remember me ?
poor harry , i wish he was dead , he would be safe from all of you then .
vienna is a closed city , miss schmidt , he ca n't get away .
if you help me , i am prepared to help you . anna martins always said you were a fool ...
i do n't know .
miss schmidt , we know he is somewhere across the canal in the russian sector ... you may as well help us . in a few minutes colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers . tell me where lime is .
i 'm sorry - i do n't seem able to understand anything you say . he 's alive now this minute - he 's doing something .
that 's what we want to find out .
where 's harry ?
i said another man was buried in his place .
what did you say ? i 'm sorry ...
joseph harbin 's body was found in the coffin .
it 's true then ?
i want the truth , miss schmidt . we know he is alive .
two weeks ago .
now then , miss schmidt , i 'm not interested in your forged papers - that 's purely a russian case . when did you last see lime ?
what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down .
you can help us .
it was n't important .
in one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called joseph . he gave you the number of the casanova club . that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go .
it 's stupid to lie to me , miss schmidt . i 'm in a position to help you .
no .
he works in a military hospital .
no .
joseph harbin ...
i have never seen him .
do you know this man ?
we loved each other , do you mean that ?
you know as much as i do , miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime , were n't you ?
and my passport ?
right . sit down miss schmidt , we will send your letters and things back to you .
there 's nothing in them .
they 'll be returned to you , miss schmidt , as soon as they 've been examined .
you wo n't learn anything from them . they are only love letters . there are not many of them .
that 's the reason .
they 're harry 's .
must you take those letters ? calloway yes , i 'm afraid so .
yes .
... parents .
good-bye .
well , i 'll be saying good night . good night , miss .
thank you , you have been so kind . anna moves down to stand cl of paine .
i do n't ...
here we are . you 'll be all right here , miss .
well , i 've got it when you want it , miss .
i do n't want it .
there you are , miss , your receipt for the letters .
that 's all right , miss , do n't worry . we 're used to it - like doctors .
they are - private - letters .
they 'll be returned , miss .
must you take those ?
i 'll carry a copy of one of your books . harry gave it to me .
how will i know you ?
just around the corner .
where ?
austrians are n't allowed in your hotel . could n't we meet at the mozart cafe ?
i would very much like to meet you , baron . come around .
i was a friend of harry lime .
yes .
can i have that woman 's passport ?
... austrian police headquarters .
thank you .
yes , of course .
please keep this passport to yourself , until i make some inquiries , will you , major ?
no , not yet .
we are interested in this case . have you arrested the girl ?
this is forgery . it is very clever .
what is it ?
i have n't got a sensible name , calloway .
be sensible , martins .
one ca n't just leave - please .
well , there 's not much time .
wait a minute - let me out .
i 'll do what i can , if she 'll let me .
calloway , ca n't you do something about anna ?
two thirty .
what time is it ?
i 'll be your dumb decoy duck .
win what ?
i said you win .
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas ...
all right , calloway . you win .
paine lent me one of your books ; `` oklahoma kid , '' i think it was . read a bit of it ... think it 's pretty good . what made you take up this sort of thing ? been doing it for long ?
why do n't you come in , too - you 're a writer ... might interest you .
of course .
do you mind if i drop off somewhere on the way ? i 've got an appointment , wo n't take five minutes ...
you all did .
did n't i ?
she 's right . it 's none of my business .
a girl of spirit .
oh , there you are . come in here , there is n't much time .
calloway !
calloway , you expect too much . i know he deserves to hang , you proved your stuff . but twenty years is a long time - do n't ask me to tie the rope .
we 'll never get him in the russian zone .
it would n't work .
yes , yes , yes , and then he vanished out there , i suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of ...
i tell you i heard him running ahead of me .
how about the doorway ?
i was on that side , the shadow was on that side , and no turnings on either side .
which side of the road ?
fifty yards right down there .
yes . where were you when you saw him first ?
look ... i tell you , you do n't think i 'm blind , do you ?
no .
i suppose you do n't believe me .
i see .
this is where he vanished .
well ? ...
i followed his shadow until suddenly ...
thank you . excuse me .
... in the morning .
i 'm not asking you to .
... be responsible for you in the streets .
it 's more like a mortuary than police headquarters .
... a week ago .
i ca n't . he disappeared ...
bring him in .
so would i .
i would like a word with this orderly harbin .
next , paine .
calloway , you have n't shown me one shred of evidence .
that is the racket harry lime organized .
are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder ?
do you see what that means ?
in vienna ...
well ?
i 'm only a little fool - i 'm an amateur at it - you 're a professional . you 've been shaking your cap and bells all over town .
oh , stop behaving like a fool , martins .
a parrot bit me .
a bruised lip .
what do you want to see a doctor for , huh ?
do you mind if i use that line in my next western ? you ca n't chuck me out , my papers are in order .
death is at the bottom of everything , martins . leave death to the professionals .
as soon as i get to the bottom of this , i 'll get the next plane .
get the next plane .
you 're not locking her up ?
miss schmidt .
calloway .
tactful too , are n't we , callaghan ?
i 'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident . the only important thing is that he 's dead .
and there was a third man there . i suppose that does n't sound peculiar to you .
oh , pinning things on girls now .
getting around , martins .
what the devil ?
going to find me the real criminal ? it sounds like one of your stories .
... expense .
calloway - i 'm english , not irish .
listen , callaghan .
well , you could say that murder was part ...
why do n't you catch a few murderers for a change ?
it was n't petrol .
... a cop . you 're a real cop i suppose .
pin it on a ...
ever seen one ?
... policemen . i have to call them sheriffs .
he was ...
what are you trying to say ?
... to him .
best thing that ever happened ...
him dying like that .
what ?
must have known i was broke . even sent me an airplane ticket . it 's a shame .
no .
`` death at the double x ranch '' - ra- a-nch .
i ca n't say that i have .
did you ever hear of `` the lone rider of santa fe ? ''
no , sorry .
holly martins .
i 'm afraid i 've never heard of you . what 's your name again ?
once in a while .
see much of him before that ?
september '39 .
when did you see him last ?
back in school . never so lonesome in my life till he showed up .
schmolka !
could you buy me one . i have n't got any austrian kroners . thanks .
you 've had a bit of a shock , have n't you ? you could do with a drink .
no .
been here long ?
yes .

martins .
my name is calloway .
fellow called lime .
can you tell me whose ...
no , no . leave them for a while .
shall i go over there , sir ?
i 'd like to visit texas one day , sir .
... of santa fe . ''
you know , paine 's one of your devoted readers . he 's promised ...
very good , sir .
this way , miss .
write her out a receipt , paine . give her a receipt for these letters too .
i 'm so glad to have met you , sir . i 've read quite a few of your books .
it 's a military hotel .
take him to sacher 's .
please be careful , sir . up we come . written anything lately ?
well , look , is there a car here i can use ?
i 'll look it up for you .
... his number .
no , i do n't know ...
do you know his number ?
please hurry up - just get him on the telephone .
... excuse me .
oh , mr. martins ...
get me major callaghan on the phone .
oh , that is mr. martins ' little joke , of course ...
zane grey .
of course , of course , of course .
well , yes . i suppose that is what i meant to say .
oh , i thought you would know , you 're a writer . of course you do . good night , old man .
what 's that ?
on the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the crisis of faith .
what about ?
hello - mr. martins , we tried to get you at your hotel . we have arranged that lecture for tomorrow .
good evening mr. crabbin .
oh , mr. martins , good evening .
it is , and i 'm gunning just the same way for your major callaghan .
seems exciting .
certainly .
... this lecture business , you 'll put me up here a while ?
is that what you say to people after death ? `` goodness that 's awkward ... ''
goodness , that 's awkward .
i was going to stay with him , but he died thursday .
i 've heard of him , of course , but i did n't exactly know him .
heard of harry lime ?
no , a major , were you really ?
it was just a soldier . i was trying to punch his major in the eye .
i do n't need a dentist . somebody hit me , that 's all .
i know a very good dentist .
come upstairs a moment .
listen , mr. martins , if you 'd agree to be our guest , we 'd be delighted to have you .
how long can one stay here on this stage money ?
nonsense . your novels are very popular here . are n't they , sergeant ?
they would n't know me .
i 'll tell you what , mr. martins . on wednesday night at our institute , we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel ... i thought perhaps you 'd like to speak .
welcome ?
yes , cultural re-education section propaganda . very important in a place like this . we do a little show each week . last week we did `` hamlet '' and the week before we had something ...
you do !
excuse me , have you got tooth ...
... leaving tomorrow , sir .
very popular . are you staying long ?
very popular , sir .
yes , hindu dances , thank you , sergeant . this is the first opportunity we 've had of making an american author welcome .
striptease , sir .
have you , sergeant ? author - martins . thank you , sergeant .
oh , he 's very goad , sir . i 've read quite a few of his books .
never heard of him .
the author . thought you might be interested .
who ?
mr. holly martins , sir .
what is it , sergeant ?
mr. crabbin .
what do you want ?
... this way .
do you know , i do n't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things ... victims ?
have you ever seen any of your victims ?
sure ...
i remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out ...
part ? you can have any part you want , so long as you do n't interfere ... i have never cut you out of anything yet .
what did you expect me to be - part of your ...
do n't try to be a policeman , old man .
you told them , did n't you ?
i wish i could get rid of this thing .
as long as they can use you ?
i 'm only safe in the russian zone ... i 'm safe as long as they can use me ...
outside of your stories ... i 've got to be careful .
you 've got plenty of contacts .
it 's far better thing that i do ... holly , you and i are n't heroes , the world does n't make any heroes ...
why not ?
do you expect me to give myself up ?
you can get somebody else ...
what do you want me to do ?
you would n't do anything .
well , i 've got quite a lot on my mind .
you do n't care anything at all about anna , do you ?
did the police believe you ?
and - anna ...
unwise , holly ...
i told the police .
... exactly who did you tell about me ? hmm ?
holly ...
you can help her .
what can i do , old man , i 'm dead , are n't i ?
tough ... tough ... do n't worry , old man , they wo n't hurt her .
she 's been arrested .
hmm .
it 's good to see you , holly .
listen , harry - i did n't believe that ...
talk to me ? ... of course ... come on ...
i want to talk to you .
yes .
listen ...
well , well , they seem to 've been giving you quite some busy time .
hello , harry .
all right - i 'm mad . i 've seen a ghost ...
are you mad ?
how do you do .
mr. popescu - mr. martins .
yes . the man who helped carry him .
the roumanian ?
mr. popescu is here tonight .
but you will .
not yet .
what 's the name of this girl ?
... the best way one can , you know .
i live in the russian sector , but you 'll find me at the casanova club every night . one has to work ...
... your address ?
will you give me ...
what 's the good of another post mortem ? suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to harry ?
not necessarily . she 'd probably want to help .
only his doctor , dr. winkel .
... you .
a roumanian .
well , there was only you , and this friend of his . who is he ?
but he said he died instantaneously .
... you know and all that .
what did he say ?
... were of you .
here ?
we came out of his place like this , and were walking this way . a friend of his called to him from over there . harry went across and from up there came the truck . it was just about here .
at the end of every chapter --
you really liked it ?
tension ? kurtz suspense .
it 's wonderful how you keep the tension .
zwei zwartze .
coffee .
mr. martins . delighted to meet you . come let 's sit down here . ober ! zwei . what would you like . tea ? coffee ?
not necessarily .
in great pain ?
... he was . yes , for a short time , while they carried him across the road .
i understand ...
could he have been at all conscious ?
i can tell you very little . he was run over by a car . he was dead when i arrived .
hear the details .
find out ?
i have guests waiting .
thank you .
coming to the point , please .
martins .
yes .
vinkel ... you 've got quite a collection of er-collection .
vinkel .
dr. winkel ?
i am not a bad man .
yes , it is .
well make it your business .
i have no evidence . i saw nothing . i said nothing . it 's not my business .
das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern ...
now , hold on .
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei .
suppose i take ...
der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert . i should have listened to my wife . she said you were up to no good . gossip .
you do n't know it was an accident . you only saw a dead man and three men carry him .
police ? why police ? das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen . no , no . it is all nonsense ; it was an accident .
you got ta tell your story to the police .
no , no . he came late after they carried him to the joseph statue .
you do n't mean that doctor ?
there was a third man - he did n't give evidence .
and ?
yes .
the roumanian ?
yes .
kurtz .
who else ?
... give evidence .
ah , er war gleich tot - i mean , sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu . ein moment ... wart ein bissel ... wartein bissel . fraulein schmidt !
i was told that he did not die at once .
er , alive ? he could n't have been alive , not with his head in the way it was .
oh , er - oh ... was he - was he still alive ?
conscious ? cas soll ich auch noch wissen ?
could he have been conscious ?
why did n't they bring him in the house ?
not saw , heard ... heard . i heard the brakes . wham ! and i got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er ... er joseph ... that 's joseph emperor joseph statue .
you saw it ?
happened ... yes happened right down there .
what 's he saying ?
sehen sie da gleich da unter . da unten ist est passiert . passiert - english .
what does he say ?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen .
... popescu ...
yes , yes , i remember you .
you remember me ? upstairs ...
mr. lime - yes .
did you know mr. lime well ?
yes , sir .
excuse me !
must be some mistake .
baron kurtz .
mr. lime 's . accident ...
coffin ?
who ?
already gone .
english ?
speak english ?
never .
... mr. martins ?
why no , mr. martins .
should i make it all fact ?
yes .
... this time .
not when i get interested .
mr. martins ...
a novel , mr. martins ?
third man .
joseph harbin ? no ... no .
joseph harbin .
no .
not necessarily .
he probably knows a lot more than that . somebody 's lying .
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue .
what else did he tell you ?
will we never teach these austrians to be good citizens . it was his duty to give the evidence .
he did n't want to get involved .
was n't he at the police inquiry ?
what else ?
that 's all you meant ?
of course there was . some ice for mr. martins .
something wrong .
funny ?
i thought there was something funny about the whole thing .
two double whiskeys . was wunschen sie ?
harry ...
not the sort of thing i should confess to a total stranger , but you have to break the rules sometimes . humanity 's duty .
oh , you did .
i thought he 'd be here to meet me .
okay .
lime . harry lime .
his name ?
with him . fifteen stiffgasse .
where are you staying ?
a friend of mine offered me a job here .
what 's the purpose of your visit here ?
oh .
passport , please .
thanks .
yea , ok. i will be , i will be , i promise .
look i do n't care about the money right now : i just want some sleep . so if you could be quiet -
ten dollars . i 'll find a way to pay you back . how would you like to know about somewhere special ? the perfect beach . paradise . no one else knows about it . that 's got to be worth something . what do you say ?
yeah , that 's right . now could you be quiet so i can get some sleep .
you . you 're the guy that lent me the money .
just take it , ok .
thank you , sir . thank you . i promise i will repay you .
here .
if you could see your way to lending me some cash -
i 'm sorry . i ca n't lend you any money .
i 'll share something with you .
just five dollars , please .
i 'm really sorry but i just arrived ; i 'm on a pretty tight budget myself . i just ca n't afford it .
i 'm waiting on some money coming through . it 's just that at the moment , you know , i 'm short . they 're going to chuck me out . on the street in bangkok , that 's bad .
i 'm sorry , i do n't think so .
yeah ; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe .
help you out ?
look , i 'm sorry to bother you but i was wondering if you could help me out .
richard . hi .
i 'm daffy .
yes ?
excuse me .
i would n't know anything about that , sir .
why not ? thai girls best in the world . thai food best in the world . thai dope best in the world .
i do n't think so .
you go to patpong ? see smoke from pussy , ping pong ball from pussy , razor blade from pussy ; bird from pussy .
traveler .
what are you doing in thailand ? tourist ?
fuck off .
what about moliere ?
was there a shark ? did you see a shark ?
she just went under the water . she was pulled under . oh god , i do n't see her .
what happened ?
she is gone !
a bit fucking late .
i 'm sorry .
well to be honest , etienne , i would rather have not known about it .
nothing . i just thought you ought to know .
well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it .
yes .
big ?
i do n't know , just a fin . over there . about a hundred meters .
a shark fin ?
a fin !
what !
richard - i saw a fin !
i think we 're about half way .
we 're ok .
everyone ok ?
i have no idea but it looks like a long way .
so how many miles do you think it is ?
we think in miles , not kilometers .
so ?
i do n't know - i 'm american .
yeah , ok. forget it . we wo n't tell anyone .
richard , it 's secret . that 's the whole point .
we 're going to swim `` one or two kilometers '' across open sea , from one uninhabited island to another . something goes wrong . what then ?
why ?
oh . great . not far at all . i do n't like to be negative , but do you think we should let someone know where we 're going ?
one or two kilometers .
yes , of course i can swim . how far do you think it is ?
that 's the wrong one .
he will not take us to the island . it 's in the national park and it is forbidden to go there . but we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night .
there is one problem .
nice work .
it 's arranged . tomorrow morning . eight hundred bath .
of course , but look ; all these people . if that place existed , they 'd all be there .
it would be nice though , if there was a place like that . you know , that no one could get to .
we moved rooms because of him .
oh , that noise ! yes , he certainly did .
she means your neighbor . the scotsman
the noise ? do n't worry . you 're on holiday .
good morning .
bonjour .
richard ?
two .
one kilometer
you can swim ?
we leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim .
it was ridiculous ; all this at three o'clock in the morning .
but he has been there , off course .
it 's on an island that no one get to .
he said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach .
what idiot would lend him money ? it would disappear .
he tried to borrow money from us .
if it 's too far , then we 'll drown . but if we dont try then we 'll never know .
too far ?
it 's just the sky , richard .
sorry . i thought i was doing quite well .
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them .
richard , you know something -
exactly .
so on one you are rich , on another poor . on one you are a murderer , on another the victim .
there are infinite worlds out there , where anything that can happen does happen .
incredible .
you realize that in the eternity of space , there is a planet , just like this one , where you are photographing back towards us . you 're photographing yourself .
one night i will get the perfect photograph .
i think so too .
sshh . etienne will be angry if i wake him . he thinks i waste film taking photographs of the sky .
francoise -
i think it 's a bad idea to tell anyone .
no .
have you told someone ?
swim ?
we swim .
so from there to there ?
hi there . here , take a look .
hi .
i hope our noise did not keep you awake .
not too bad .
did you sleep well ?
eh - bonsoir .
bonsoir .
uh-huh .
so there 's an urban myth , well more of a rural myth , going around here at the moment . it 's about a beach .
so ?
exactly . always happened to someone else .
woman bites chicken leg , turns out to be a mouse . or a rat . it 's an urban myth .
do you know the kentucky friend mouse story ? ''
where did you lose it ?
we lost our key .
then let him destroy me now . let him crush me like the conceited bully he is . go ahead . kill me . here i am . do it ! !
and you , if you had come out of egypt , you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf .
i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt . moriah , and we still live in terror ... .
watch your language ... .
i do ; i follow it . but okay , say god provided the ram . so what ? once abraham raised the knife , in his heart it was as if he 'd killed him . he could never forget that . and neither could isaac . look at him : he 's traumatized , he 's a putz for the rest of his life . by the end he ca n't tell jacob from esau ... .
no one follows that midrash .
there 's midrash supporting this . my father read a book by shalom spiegel that -- isaac actually died and was reborn .
you think ? ! based on what ?
we have free will and intelligence -- which god allegedly gave us ... .
but , danny , if hashem is everything , and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions ?
the nazis did everything the fhrer told them . you do everything the torah tells you . or the rebbe . identical slave mentality .
they sound like you .
read the early zionists on european jewry ; they sound like goebbels .
they had sabra and shattila .
they do n't have extermination camps .
they 're racist , they 're militaristic , they act like bullyboys in the territories ... .
the zionists are n't nazis .
whereas avi 's a zionist nazi .
i rest my case . he 's a jewish nazi . he always was .
what 's a fascist ?
what are you doing here , i thought you were a nazi .
they only kill them when they love them ?
fine , go ahead . touch the letters .
that 's a movie , you moron .
that was an ark , man . that was a torah . they fucked around with it , and the torah melted their faces .
what ? ?
did n't you see < i > raiders of the lost ark < /i > ?
he 's an asshole .
fucking danny , man ...
she 's been giving me the eye . she 's hot . so i wait till the owner goes up front ... .
are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ?
... so she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on ? and i think fuck it ... .
just do n't .
why the fuck not ?
yeah , but not on the letters .
no , you do n't ... . if you hated them , you 'd study them , so you 'd know why you hate them . you know what tefillin is ? tsitsis ? shotness ? you know the kaddish from the kiddush ? eichmann ? he went to israel . he studied the torah , the talmud , the mishnah , the whole bit . he hated jews .
fuck you . i hate the jews at least as much as you do .
how come you do n't know it ? how can you say you hate the jews when you do n't know anything about --
how come you know all this shit ?
the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters . they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there , with secret , alternative meanings .
fire ...
it 's called the flame alphabet . it 's supposed to be the word of god written in fire .
let 's look at the fucking thing .
i do n't , but ...
what do you care ?
billings , if hitler did n't kill six million , why is he your hero ? ... concentration camps all over europe , and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand ... . he 's a putz .
yeah . he 's a respected scholar . even no-am chomsky says he --
where did you read this ? robert faurisson ?
danny , it 's true . there were no six million . at most , two hundred thousand jews died in the camps . and the majority of them were from disease and --
oh , please ...
why 'd we have to leave so fast ?
yes .
do we have to listen to this shit ?
we 'll go to the country sometime , okay ?
you coming ?
read < i > mein kampf < /i > ? hitler had all his best ideas in prison .
what , do you like it here ?
then i wo n't bring you ... .
bring your friends ... . we 're not his friends .
who am i ? ? who are you , you schmucks , you ca n't even make a decent swastika ... . give me the paint . give it to me .
who the fuck are you ?
what do you think you 're doing ?
maybe i am . maybe we 're all jews now . what 's the difference ?
you 're a jew . maybe you do n't realize it , but you are .
you will .
i do n't care about money .
no , they do n't . not the smart ones . look , i 'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status ... . but when you fall off this horse , come see me . i can show you how to make a lot of money .
people still need values , beliefs ... .
forget the jewish stuff . it does n't play anymore . there 's only the market , now , and it does n't care who you are .
yeah , i read your piece . it 's very smart . and very wrong .
actually , i think this moment has possibilities that --
fifty 's an exaggeration . anyway , that was a different moment . things were possible that are n't now .
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine .
this ? this is a joke . i 'll give your group a thousand bucks .
i have a job .
you write that ? come work for me . you 've got a lot to learn ; i can teach it to you .
you do n't own this place .
you got ta get out of here .
miriam called , looking for you . she said you might come , so i ...
you eat first , then you light . once you light , it 's yom kippur , which means you 're fasting , so you ca n't ... eat .
look , just light the candles with me . then we 'll eat . you have to eat .
yeah , okay . but what if ... what if ... submitting ... being crushed , being nothing , not mattering , what if that 's the best feeling we can have ?
and be crushed .
he commands it whether he exists or not ... look , we can fight him and be crushed . or we can submit .
nothing . why are you doing this ? i thought god did n't exist .
no . what are you looking for ?
shit ... did you talk to your mother today ?
i do n't know . i just want to try it .
is it like eichmann ? are we goofing ?
come on , we can be like eichmann . he studied torah . he hated jews .
lina , come here !
you ca n't . do you know how many people i 've brought into ... the movement ... ?
i mean kiddush . let 's say kiddush . and shave my head , fuck through a sheet , all that stuff ... come on , just for fun . to see what it 's like ...
kaddish is the prayer for the dead .
okay ... why do n't we light candles on friday ? let 's light candles ... . and say the kaddish .
you want a punch in the mouth ?
'cause he was n't a rabbi .
believe me , adolf hitler could n't possibly have hated the jews as much as i do . not in a billion years . you know why ?
is that why you became a nazi ? so you could talk about jews incessantly ?
the real nazis . hitler , goebbels , they talked about jews incessantly ... . you ever read their diaries ? ...
do they ?
nazis talk about it all the time .
it 's all you talk about . jewish , jewish , jewish . nobody talks about it that much except the jews .
what ... ? you think i 'm jewish ?
oh , am i learning it faster than you did ? maybe i 'm smarter .
plus you have nothing else to do all day .
i told you , i 'm good at this .
you 're learning the hebrew really fast .
judaism does n't even need god . you have the torah , the law . that 's your fucking god ... . the book 's closed .
no , i think you should n't .
you think i should just because there 's no reason ?
you should n't .
why should i submit ?
do n't curse in front of it .
fuck that .
no . nothing follows . you do n't do it because it 's smart or stupid or it saves your soul . you 're not saved . nobody 's saved . you do it because the torah tells you do . you submit to the torah .
and belief follows ?
about doing things . you light candles , say prayers , keep the sabbath , visit the sick ... .
what 's it about ?
nothing but nothingness ... judaism 's not about belief .
christianity 's silly , but at least there 's something to believe in . or not believe . judaism there 's nothing .
no difference .
v'asitem lechem pessel to-monat . and make no graven image of the lord , or the form of any figure , or of man or woman , or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything . because he 's not like anything . not only ca n't you see him or hear him , you ca n't even think about him . i mean , what 's the difference between that and him not existing ?
v'asitem ...
payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem ...
vuv ... zayin ... chet ... tet ...
with you there 's a tragic dimension .
even though his dick is so big ?
the sex is better .
they do n't put them in the torah . i 'll get you a chumash , they 'll have them there ... bet ... gimel ... dalid ... hay ... how come you 're here instead of with curtis ? besides the hebrew lessons ...
where are they ?
it 's silent . it holds a place , takes a vowel . the vowels are little dots that go under the letters .
it looks a little like a swastika .
good question . both . aleph ...
who gets contaminated , the jews or the gentiles ?
you ca n't curse in front of it either .
what assholes .
see , the jews love to separate things : the holy from the profane , milk from meat , wool from linen , the sabbath from the week , the jew from the gentile ... . as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that .
yeah , it 's stupid . put it on , or i wo n't teach you .
that 's stupid .
they think it 's the word of god , and it 's holy , and the flesh is n't ... .
why not ?
put something on . you 're not supposed to be naked in front of it .
i 'm good at languages .
hebrew 's very difficult . it would take years .
know your enemy ... . 'cause it 's a basic text of western culture . i want to read it in the original . okay ?
why ?
i want to learn to read it .
and god said to avram , take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father 's house into the land -- a different land -- and i will show you ... .
what 's it mean ?
va-yomer adonai el avram : lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha ...
oh , yeah ...
va-yomer ... and he said . it goes the other way .
'cause i want to know ... . what is this word ? this one here ...
what do you care ?
but you can read it , the hebrew ... . right ?
no .
do you know it like that ? by heart .
that was a later invention , it 's not in the scrolls ... . anyway , the jews know where the sentences end . they know the whole thing by heart . every word . every letter .
how come there 's no punctuation ?
i stole it . from a synagogue .
where 'd you get this ?
no .
i 'm coming to your room tonight .
he 's at a home out here .
your father ? ?
you ca n't .
when can i see you ?
i 'm talking to you right now . who 's linda ?
why wo n't you talk to me ?
who 's linda ?
then how come you 're talking to me ?
bigger and better .
oh , really ?
too many good players down here . i 'm with one right now .
you were n't complaining about my play last time .
i bet . he did n't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one .
yes , i am . basically i am .
you 're not like the others , are you ? ... your friends .
that 's stupid . why would they ?
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness ?
killing himself .
what 's he care about ?
i guess . his parents are . he does n't care about that .
is he a nazi ?
he 's in a mental institution ... . he 's been there for ten years , off and on . mostly on .
are they still together ?
they 're my father 's . he 's from argentina . my mother 's family went there during the war . that 's where they met .
how come so many of the books are in spanish ?
`` and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms ... ''
`` ... < i > und die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilze < /i > ... ''
you want it to be an event .
why no silencer ?
i just read it ... .
where 'd you read all that stuff ?
i work at the big boy warehouse . in queens . i drive a fork-lift .
you 're not in school ? what do you do ?
at first , no one will know why the victims are being killed .
which is what ?
abstraction . they 're obsessed with abstraction .
disease ? what disease ?
the point is , the modern world is a jewish disease .
too christian . you know jameson ? paul virilio ?
too difficult ?
nobody reads that stuff anymore .
have you read toynbee ? spengler ?
why do n't you come visit , we 'll have a rematch .
that 's a much easier game .
he called me up . he wanted to talk to me about my ideas .
i doubt it . how did you find out ?
i did n't notice his shoes ... . did your mother know he was there ?
really , which one ? i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes .
did you know that there was a < i > new york times < /i > reporter there that night ?
i do n't . i was just curious how full of shit you were .
i did n't realize you cared .
yeah , i remember ... . kill any jews yet ?
carla ? ... it 's me , danny ... danny balint ... ? we met at that ... [ meeting at your house . ]
i 'm stealing it .
why are you taking that ?
nothing . let 's go ... .
what 'd you say ?
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod .
who 's eichmann ? ! ! ?
who 's eichmann ?
i 'll go look ... .
i thought there were people here ... .
we need intellectuals , we have enough thugs already .
danny , the night we met , you said the name ilio manzetti . we were impressed . we were excited . but here it is september , and mr. manzetti is still walking around breathing the air .
he 's jewish ? manzetti ?
an investment banking house .
lina , the thousand-year reich barely lasted a decade ... . do you really want to go down that road again ? in america of all places , where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues ...
it 's a romantic movement , curtis . it always has been .
yes , of course . but that only plays in this room , with people who are n't embarrassed to call themselves nazis . if you want a modern fascism , you do n't mention jews .
did you see how they reacted to him ?
... i thought we agreed , no anti- semitism ... it 's exactly what we 're trying to put behind us ... . trash the blacks , fine ; but ...
i 've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler . how am i supposed to --
that does n't seem to be happening , does it ?
what about ... manzetti , the synagogues ... .
i 've been waiting all my life for something like this .
we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream : works like < i > the bell curve < /i > , < i > sociobiology < /i > , anti-zionism , anti- immigration , the com-munitarian issue ... . we 'll hold conferences : invite liberals , blacks , jews . chomsky , cockburn , stanley crouch , shahack ... .
what 's that ? okay . surprise us ...
a week or so . there 's something i want to do here first .
they left an hour ago . you mind some personal advice ? forget carla . that 's not the side your bread 's buttered on . how soon can you get back to the city ?
what about mrs. moebius and ... ?
leo strauss ... i 've got to go to boston . i came to say goodbye .
it 's the truth ... .
i 'm sure they are . but what do we accomplish by pointing it out ?
they 're liars and cowards .
... insulting people who were in the camps . ... what 's the point ?
i 'd have to research it , study his routines , his security ... . but ideally on a new york street at midday , using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer .
how would you kill him ?
totally . the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven .
is n't that what we want ? germany all over again ? only done right this time ...
but when it comes out , the public will be outraged . it will look like germany all over again .
i 'd say nothing . after two or three , people will try to find a pattern . a reason .
you would n't announce it ?
no , but deep down , beneath the `` tolerance '' they learn on television , nothing 's changed . the very word makes their skin crawl . it is n't even hate , really . it 's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor . we want to step on it . crush it . we do n't even know why . it 's a physical reaction . everyone feels it .
they used to . today it 's not an issue .
people hate jews . do you agree ?
that would be a catastrophic mistake .
decentralized , nonviolent , increasingly mainstream . we 'll see antiabortion , anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby , christian identity types , tax resisters and even some libertarians ... .
obviously .
more cultural than political .
get the fuck away from me .
it 's too late ... . if i did n't , somebody else would . yom kippur starts at sundown . will you go to synagogue ?
if i tell you , will you pull the story ? not write about me ?
who killed manzetti ?
yeah , and what are you ? a < i > times < /i > man ? a presbyterian ? impotent ? a prick ?
i do n't think you know what you are .
you work for the < i > new york times < /i > . your whole job in life is not to understand things like me .
explain it so i can .
i do n't . look , stay out of what you do n't understand .
how do you reconcile the two ?
what were you , following me ?
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally . last week you went to a torah study group .
no .
did you kill ilio manzetti ?
yes . infinitely more . they would become as god .
but if the jews are strengthened by hate , would n't this `` destruction '' you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already ?
does that mean you deny what he says is true ? yes or no .
it 's slander . it 's reckless disregard . i 'll sue you and your fucking jew paper .
give me a reason not to .
to discredit me . because i know who they are . look , i thought i explained it to you . those people can say or do anything . and they will . it 's all narrative to them , it 's ... are you going to print what this guy said ?
why would nadelman lie ?
listen to me ... .
that 's what i 'm trying to find out , danny . who am i fucking with here ?
do you know who you 're fucking with here ?
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else ?
look at me . do i look jewish ? look ...
so you 're saying it 's not true .
you believe that ? and you call yourself a reporter ?
he says you were bar mitzvahed there , in march 1988 .
who ? how would i know him ?
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman ? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park ... ?
what ? excuse me ? ... you 're kidding , right ?
differences exist , of course , but they 're irrelevant . for the jew , his jewishness dominates everything . even the ones who renounce it , who hate it , who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife ... ca n't escape . they 're still just jews .
are all jews the same ?
notice the israelis : a fundamentally secular society . they no longer need judaism because they have soil . the real jew is a wanderer , a nomad . he has no roots , no attachments . so he `` universalizes '' everything . he ca n't hammer a nail , plow a field . he can only buy and sell , invest capital , manipulate markets . he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books , ideas , numbers . this is his strength ... . take the great jewish minds : marx , freud , einstein . what have they given us : communism , infantile sexuality and the atom bomb . in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe , they 've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare , irrational urges and relativity , a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt . why ? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread , nothing but nothingness . nothingness without end ...
of course they 're jews .
those are n't jews .
he has israel .
deracinate ... tear out the roots . a people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land : the sun , the sea , the soil . this is how they know themselves . but the jew does n't have soil .
the jews clearly control the media and the banks . investment banks , not the commercial ones . but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality . they undermine traditional life ; they deracinate society .
so , fine , it 's not that the jew , the jews own the media and the banks . it 's that they 're sexually corrupt .
let 's just say i 've done due diligence .
danny , what makes you think you know all this ?
you 're not listening . he is n't better . he gives pleasure , but that 's actually a weakness .
does that mean the jew is the better lover ?
real men -- white , christian men -- we fuck a woman . we make her come with our cocks . but the jew does n't like to penetrate and thrust -- he ca n't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions . oral sex is technically a perversion , you know that , do n't you ? after a woman has been with a jewish man , she never wants a normal partner again . a normal man .
female ...
because the jew is essentially female .
why ?
yes . it 's very pleasurable . but the jews are obsessed with it . you know why ?
everybody likes to , do n't they ?
and jewish men like to get it .
i do n't know . is that right ?
jewish girls like to give head , right ?
notice ? like what ... ?
and ? what did you notice ?
what 's that go to do with ... i 've gone out with a , with jewish women . why ?
did you ever fuck one , guy ?
what ? ? ! ?
you ever fuck a jewish girl ?
sexuality ? ? ? what do you mean ?
let me give you an example ... . sexuality .
a poison ... ?
the jews are different ... . blacks are disgusting and inferior , but it 's like criticizing a retarded child . the jews are ... a poison in the human well ... .
danny , what about the jews ?
german . mine , too . so who do you think 's given more to the world , the germans -- beethoven , goethe , nietzsche -- or the entire continent of africa ? ibos , bantus , mandingos ...
my mother 's family is french , my father 's was german , originally .
what should i be , a white inferior- ist ? a multicultural zulu egalitarian ? let me ask , where are your people from ?
it helps me concentrate ... . so does that mean you 're a white supremacist ?
in the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there 's a hierarchy of the races . not just in iq , but in the civilization , the art , the forms of government , the civilizations that each race produces ... why are you writing this down if you 're recording it ?
the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease . could you elaborate on that ?
i agree .
curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler . he 's not a thinker .
what about curtis zampf ?
i 'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next ... .i thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting .
no ... yeah , fine , go ahead ... so what 's this about ? is this about me ?
is it okay if i record this ?
there 's a bomb here . it 's going to go off at seven-thirty .
you shut up . who do you think you are ?
fucking kike .
danny , i 'm trying to -- save you .
the truth does n't mean anything to you , does it ?
think about your father . your sister .
i ca n't say that .
and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an anti-semite . if you 'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously , you never would have said it .
but i was n't .
all right , what if all along you were actually infiltrating the nazis -- to expose them ... .
i was just talking . i -- look , i ca n't help what i think .
so are you ... but they 'll believe you ... . lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea . that you proposed it in a meeting at her house . ah , jesus , danny ... what were you thinking ? are you glad manzetti 's dead ? do you really want to kill jews ? you want to kill me ?
you 're lying .
it was a nine millimeter .
a forty-five .
you 're telling me you killed him ? you ? killed him ? bullshit . what kind of gun did you use ?
with the shoes ... there was more than one ?
which < i > times < /i > guy ?
you mean the < i > times < /i > guy ?
i work in the da 's office . you go to those meetings , half the people there are informants .
how did you ... ?
tell me about lina moebius .
this is me .
i ca n't help what i think .
you know the joke : a jew 's shipwrecked on a desert island . when they rescue him , they see he 's built two synagogues . they say , for vhat do you need two synagogues ? he says , vun to pray in , and vun i 'd never set foot in so long as i live , so help me god . you pray in the one you 'd never set foot in ... and vice versa .
point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking .
that does n't mean i do n't like hearing it .
i thought you hated torah .
to hear them read torah .
why did you come tonight ? to see me ?
the arguments , anyway .
i always won .
yes !
no !
... i want you to do it on the outside , too .
do n't tell me what i --
you do it on the inside ... .
i do n't do that .
i want you to say kaddish for her . it 's the only thing she asked from us ... .
how did you get the fucking number ?
lina , you said if i was going to plant a bomb , i should --
beth shalom ? what are you talking about ? who is this ... ?
beth shalom . like you wanted .
what is happening ?
lina ... it 's happening . tonight .
hello ... ?
we want to talk to you about something ... . we 're about to launch an aboveground , intellectually serious fascist movement .
fine .
how have things been going ?
forget manzetti ... . take on something simple . something you can actually accomplish . maybe he 'd be more valuable in the city .
you mean ilio manzetti ?
do you feel you 're making progress here ?
ilio manzetti ... former ambassador to france . managing partner at damon , schwarzchild .
so what jew would you kill first ?
we 're already marginal . we are saying what no one else has the guts to say . is n't that precisely our appeal ?
curtis is afraid you 'll marginalize us .
without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there 's no real power , no authority .
i was going to ask you the same thing .
are you with the fbi , mr . balint ? ... or any other law enforcement agency ?
from the rhineland originally .
what part of germany are you people from ?
it 's german .
balint ?
daniel balint .
lina moebius . and you are ... ?
steve 's going to explain it .
steve ...
but you already talked about it : you said it 's not stupid . why is n't it stupid ?
i 'm not here to talk about religious law , if you do n't like --
you can have chicken with eggs but not with milk . why is that ?
no , i do n't admit it 's stupid .
but it 's stupid , right ? you admit it 's stupid .
look , you want cheese , go someplace else .
the bible only says do n't seethe a kid in its mother 's milk . but chickens do n't give milk .
that 's meat .
what about chicken ?
you can heat them up and eat with him .
i 've got to get back to the --
do you know them ? i made him some noodles for dinner . you can heat them up and --
nobody ever beat me up . look , linda , there 're fifty reasons . even if you knew them all , there 'd be another fifty you did n't know .
the polacks ? from sacred heart ?
what kids ? ...
is this because of those kids who used to beat you up ?
oh , he decides ? hitler 's the chief rabbi now ? ...
tell it to hitler .
they 're not my people ... .
ah , jesus christ , danny , how can you wear that thing ? ... you know what it means ? to your people ...
why deprive him of his greatest pleasure ?
then he could n't be bitter about living alone .
he 's going to die . he wo n't take his medicine . he eats dairy . he probably still smokes when i 'm not around . i asked him to come live with us . alex offered to share his room , unsolicited ... . but he did n't want to be any trouble .
i just came to get some stuff . i 'll be out in five minutes . he does n't want me around .
what are you doing here ?
can anybody imagine why i would say a jewish prayer ?
a jewish prayer .
who knows what that is ?
no , it 's ... yeah , it 's true , but ... how 'd you get this number ? ... no , not here ... maybe sunday ? there 's a place off queens blvd . near the courthouse ...
is n't it true ?
who told you that ?
i 'm doing a piece on right-wing groups , post oklahoma city . i hear you 're an important figure in those circles . you have a lot of interesting ideas ... .
< i > new york times < /i > ... ?
daniel balint ? my name 's guy danielsen . i 'm a reporter with the < i > new york times < /i > .
hello ... ?
so that 's what ? nineteen thirty minutes ... what time is it now ...
seven-thirty tomorrow evening .
when do you want it to go off ?
just do it .
it 's not going to be fine . it 's --
no , it has to be tomorrow . you wo n't get this many of them in here for another year . it 'll be fine .
if i went back to the lumberyard , the guy 'd give me all the dynamite i wanted . untraceable , you would n't -- need to ...
i have an idea ... .
where ?
take a right on 59th ... we 'll put it someplace else .
so what do we do with the device ?
the manzetti thing must have scared her . she thinks she 'll get implicated .
why ? why would she ?
mrs. moebius .
who even knew ?
they do n't . i checked twenty times ... . somebody must have talked .
you said they did n't have night guards .
not too fast .
christ ...
keep driving . do n't slow down .
oh , what is this shit ?
i 'm not hungry ... . come on , let 's drive around ... . we do n't want to be spotted here .
did n't you get anything ?
it 'll be enough if we use it right . okay , the service 'll go about another hour . say an hour for the janitors , then one more just to be safe ... we 'll go in at midnight .
that 's all we 've got left .
no , it 's weird , man . nobody knows where he went .
what about drake , did he ever show up ?
it will .
i 've got ta kill some jews , kyle . i 'm serious . i 'm always talking about it . this time it 's got ta happen .
i 'm sorry , danny . it wo n't happen again . i 'm going to use a brand-new power cell . plus we 'll have a back-up timer .
that damn thing . you know how it made me look ... ?
this will be a different kind of device .
here ...
open it up .
what ... ?
shut up . fuck you ... .
green dot -- shotgun powder . for pipe bombs . a guy in a lumberyard gave it to me . a donation to the cause .
what is it ?
the mother .
which one were you aiming at ?
you look right through him . he 's there , but there 's something on the other side of him that you want . it 's all you want . and whatever 's in the way does n't matter ... . then it 's easy .
get out of here ... .
you could do it .
that was unbelievable what you did to lucas . the guy 's an animal .
her place is down the road . but she just comes out for weekends sometimes .
where 's mrs. moebius ?
number ten .
which was his room ?
get out of my way .
danny , listen , people expect me to daven ; they do n't want someone they do n't know -- leading their prayers .
shut up ...
listen , danny , you ca n't just barge in and --
wow , that 's uh ... great ...
she 's at yale law -- interning with the district attorney ... we 're getting married next spring . in israel .
yeah , hey , how 're you doing ...
you remember miriam ... .
no , no ... not that kind of ... underground . more a private ... business . private .
are you an artist ?
i 'm in a kind of ... underground ... thing .
what about you ? what are you doing ? something strange , i bet .
jts ... ?
i 'm in the rabbinic program at jts ...
yeah , uh ... so how are you ? what 's going on ?
jeez , it 's been since , what , kenny 's wedding .
what 's that ?
i did n't . i told you , i ca n't --
you missed on purpose .
just get him in the cross-hairs . with those shells , anywhere you hit him , it 'll bounce around , rip his insides all up .
i 'm a bad shot . i do n't think i can --
shoot him in the head . always shoot a jew in the head .
i was a jew in a previous life .
how ?
i can tell ... .
how did you know they were jews ?
four . but no one this important .
who 'd you kill ?
you want to kill a jew . i already did .
why me ?
lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows .
... we have nothing to learn from these people . they should learn from us .
where do you think you 're going ?
what do you think you should have done ?
okay , that 's it . you 're going back to --
so they shot him ! so he was dead . so what . he 's worse than dead now . he 's a piece of shit ...
the nazi 's killing his kid . he could 've jumped the guy . he could 've gouged his eyes out , grabbed the bayonet and gutted him ... . what would you have done if they were killing your son ?
you ca n't say that ... .
what did you do while the sergeant was killing your son ?
what are you trying to say ?
and what did you do ?
just a little ... what 's the difference ?
linda says you 're not supposed to have dairy .
there 's some maple walnut in the freezer .
valentine ...
'cause they got rid of johnson . he knew how to deal with the assholes . dallas green , please ...
and that 's when the mets started to stink .
after your mother died , that 's when you stopped going to shul . doing your homework . everything .
he was funny .
not like mr. dorfmann .
funny ?
adam sandler .
obviously .
howard stern .
no .
leary ?
dennis leary .
who 's this ?
exactly .
`` do chickens give milk ? ''
the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath , because it 's work , correct ? but if alternating current 's running through the wires every second of every day , and i throw a switch , send it here instead of there , how is that lighting a fire ?
do i give a shit ?
it 's friday ... .
danny , please , we do n't want to know .
do you think i ...
i was just trying to make a point . if --
are you out of your mind ? !
danny , please . just give your speech ... . and nothing about jews , okay ?
we redesigned the timing mechanism . it ca n't possibly malfunction .
what ?
we tested the new bomb .
i do n't care what they are . i know those people , and i do n't like them . the rest are just a bunch of kikes , are n't they ?
they 're not that jewish .
so what ?
beth shalom ? it 's reform .
do you have a suit ? let 's get him one ... . and a cell phone too . and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue , make it that big one on fifth avenue , would you ?
look , if you want to kill jews on your free time , fine . we need you to raise money . will you do that for us ?
i 'm not an intellectual ... . i mean , i read , but ... fund-raising is n't what i ...
we think you 'd be good at it .
fund-raising ? ?
we want you to help run it . give speeches , lead seminars ... handle the fund-raising .
as you know , cindy , thirteen is a mystical number in the jewish faith . we believe that god has thirteen attributes ...
oh , fuck you ...
and let us say ...
eat shit , assholes ... .
... may you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming ... .
eat shit ... .
may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you ... .
and so , on this , the most solemn day of the jewish year , a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
curtis is always more complicated than he seems . even now .
the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague , curtis zampf , has been a federal informant for the past two years . do you believe that ?
yes , and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution . really , who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish ? who thinks about such things ?
in the third reich , were n't a number of high-ranking nazis of jewish origin ?
i think anti-semitism today is largely a jewish phenomenon . would n't you agree ?
what do you mean ?
none whatsoever . but i have to admit , i 'm not terribly surprised .
... you 're saying that when he first appeared at your house , you had no idea he was jewish ... .
... you take care of yourself , johana .
not yet ... i 'm waiting for the right moment .
did you tell him ?
i do n't have the strength to fight off la mamma ... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier .
bonita , you should n't be discouraged so easily .
of course .
yes ... could you please give this to enzo .
you 're leaving ?
very much , i think . but , there 's going to be a problem .
and you ... ? do you love enzo ?
well , you 're going to have to tell him , sometime !
probably not , but i still do n't have the nerve to tell him .
but your man is n't quite a god !
i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night . you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods . take leda for example , sleeping with jupiter , who came to earth as a swan ... well , can you imagine leda announcing to her swan `` you 're going to be a father , my little chick-a-dee '' ?
i ca n't ... i just do n't know how to ...
maybe you should talk to him about it .
no .
does he know ?
yes .
are you going to keep it ?
... i 'm pregnant , bonita !
i think , he 's really nice ... he 's a funny guy ... sometimes even very moving .
yes . not like enzo .
he 's shy , not like enzo .
... maybe , if jacques will let me fix up the place a little .
you 're going to live here permanently ?
yes , is n't it wonderful ? i 'm so happy . i 'll bet i 'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world !
he seems to have won it .
no . he 's french , he was just in italy for the competition .
the italian , i presume ?
will that interfere with my getting maternity leave ? i 'm pregnant .
you 're right . you 're fired .
remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium . well , we were n't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me ... ... do they come for lunch everyday ? i really went on my own business , to see a man that i happen to be in love with ... and i 'm glad i did it , but i 'm sorry about the policy and i 'll be happy to make up the money the company did n't get ... of course just now i do n't have ... one million , four hundred and ten thousand dollars . but if you were to dock my salary , say , twenty dollars a week , in a few hundred years we 'd be even ... and i think this is where you fire me ?
yes . of course . very wise .
i came to make a clean breast of everything ... the whole business .
good afternoon .
italian is practically the same thing .
i thought it was spanish that you spoke ?
i tried him , he ca n't go . his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow ... i 'll go , boss .
i 'll send cardoza , he 'll be able to ...
we have to send somebody over there immediately ! if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy . we 'll be off the hook . there 's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily .
it ca n't be true !
yes ! the notary is a phony . he has the same signature as the contractor !
no !
the documents are forged .
what 's happened ? ?
the mafia ! la cosa nostra !
what d'you mean ?
listen , i just found out we 've got real problems in sicily !
... so am i .
my god ! i 'm glad i did n't go .
like a popsicle . they 're keeping him on a stick until spring .
did the driver really freeze ?
i said that the file is incomplete .
sorry . of course not , definitely not ... well , maybe a little . what did you say ?
johana , am i boring you ?
what kind ?
this is good work ... unfortunately it 's incomplete . could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street .
the fool was asleep ! if i were n't around , he 'd already be dead ! ! ! is that who you want to live with ?
is he alright ? what happened ?
that idiot !
five minutes and fifty seconds .
because he wo n't understand and it will just hurt you ... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake . and he 's only waiting for one thing : that some god up there will turn him into a fish ! how long has that moron been down there ?
why ?
do n't .
... not yet .
you told bonita , but you did n't tell him , right ?
how do you know that ?
you really think so ? did you tell him you were pregnant ?
he can learn . he is learning .
no . jacques is a creature of the sea . he is n't meant to live on earth , among us ... you should know this , johana .
a little ... you think it 's the same for jacques ?
i dive in search of god . if i go deep enough i 'm going to find him .
i wo n't , i swear .
because you 'd laugh .
damn it ! why wo n't you give me a straight answer , for once ? !
you risk your life when you cross the street .
you know what i 'm talking about .
what else is there ?
enzo , why do you guys do this ?
checking out the competition .
what are you doing here ?
okay , now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk .
enzo !
jacques ! johana !
no , it 's the recipe for spaghetti `` frutti del mare '' . you see i was right in getting you out here . you 're a world champion , my friend !
is it a poem ?
good night enzo , good night jacques .
yes , the mamma is is there .
the mamma 's there too .
sinister is what i 'd call it ... ! ours is so much cheerful ! why do n't you come and stay with me ... there 's plenty of room in my suite .
... it 's a comfortable place .
yes ...
you going to sleep here , all by yourself ?
well , good night , then ...
enzo , stop bitching , will you ?
and the lights ! running lights , stealing stretchers ... ! you 'll have us in jail .
do n't you agree , jacques ?
congratulations , enzo .
... it 's easy . you go down . you come up . ... right , johana ?
okay .
tonight we 're having a little party among ourselves . 8 o'clock in my suite ?
listen to her ! `` that 's what he 's here for '' ! he 's here to loose , that 's what he 's here for . first of all , i 'm unbeatable . second , how old are you ?
... that 's what he 's here for , is n't he ?
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin ' gold fish , and says : `` i 'm going to beat you '' .
no .
huh ? well listen to him ! do you hear that ?
italy !
and just where are you from ?
exactly ! what is it johana ? you 're so crazy about him , you do n't see the truth ? !
i get it , enzo you were a superior child .
little . very little . and skinny , very skinny too . that is compared to me .
what was he like , when he was little ?
forever . we used to live on the same island in greece , when we were kids .
have you known him long ?
he looks strange , does n't he ? like a baby that just learned to walk .
you 'll be lovely , but no thanks . jacques , would you do a native dance for me ?
yes , of course , i 'll do the hula !
you forgot the hula !
i 'll take you there . we 'll live in the sun . you 'll cook fresh fish and we 'll make love under the coconut trees .
no .
a new world record ! that 's great ! it gives me something to beat tomorrow ! you ever been to tahiti ?
some people say it 's the most virile sport in the world . one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea , all muscles contracted in one super human effort ...
congratulations .
i might have known . as i was telling you earlier , i 'm the world champion free diver .
in a lake .
where did you two meet ?
i think i 'll have a coffee .
a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent .
it 's the free diving world championship . i am by the way world champion !
i wish , but it 's full . they recommended a pension in town . they say that all of taormina is full . what 's going on here ?
johana cross , pleased to meet you . well ! is n't this a coincidence . i really was n't expecting this ... all the way out here . it 's incredible !
this is a great pleasure .
enzo molinari .
yes .
you know each other ?
hello !
i tell you she 's mine !
what does that mean ?
in my village , we have a saying : when the wind blows , the flags of all nations flap in the same direction .
you 're going to hold me up at a time like this ?
dollars .
lira ?
ten thousand .
how many are , down there ?
the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck ; so the divers were trying to get at the engine ... and then the boat turned over ... in the current ... and ... look , i fucked up ! can you help ?
how did it happen ?
he 's training .
is he here ?
`` that '' ! this is not a `` that '' ...
where did you get that ?
i 'm meditating , ca n't you see ? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down . i can take a five minute nap , ca n't i ?
the medics are looking all over for you .
eh ? si ! avanti !
enzo , wake up !
very chic . anyway , you do n't have anything else , do you ?
what about the shoes ?
find the frenchman . find me mayol .
yes ?
a rosary for mama , a dress for
enzo , really . what are you going to get ?
then tell him to wax it too .
santini will do that for 25 dollars !
have the car painted .
enzo , what are you going to do with the money ?
six seconds .
roberto ? how long ?
hey ! d'you have any other complaints ? just make a list and we 'll stick it on the porthole ! okay ?
is that alcohol ? are you out of your mind ? alcohol is strictly forbidden .
try speaking to me ?
for others , yes ... for you , who knows ?
and ... does the voice come back ?
it 's nothing . it 's just the helium , because of the air pressure .
what 's with the voice ?
i did n't say ... brussels !
and where did you say you were from ?
noireuter .
... what 's your name again ?
the rules are the rules .
listen we 're not supposed to piss either but that does n't stop you from carrying `` it '' on board ? !
you should n't even carry cigarettes on board !
it is n't lit yet .
smoking is absolutely forbidden .
plenty of women everywhere right ?
jacques , take me back down ... please .
i ca n't .
... push me back in the water ...
... it is much better down there . it 's a better place .
... i was right about what ?
you were right .
well that 's very nice of you .
no ! i would never cheat you .
you say that because you have the title !
it 's not safe , they say . the doctors say it is n't possible to go deeper and live . free diving is over as a sport .
we ca n't dive anymore . they want to cancel the competition for a while .
i 'm concentrating .
long enough to die . listen , if you really want to die , that 's your problem , but do n't do it under my nose , okay ?
... how long was i asleep ?
enzo , do n't be angry . i was lucky ... that 's all .
that 's good .
thank you , thank you very much !
enzo , enzo ! congratulations !
it 's never the sea ! it 's roberto , mamma , that stupid actress ... oh shit ! jacques , what do you know ?
i 've had many ... when the sea does n't want you .
anybody can have a bad day !
thank you .
i give you this . you 're stubborn ... dumb , but stubborn .
... yes .
you 'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable ?
i do n't want to erase anything .
... i was seventeen , i loved her so much i tried to die for her . two years later i could n't even remember her name ! let me tell you , time erases everything !
so what ! ? his job is to hand out the paychecks . and he does that very well , let me tell you .
he does n't like us .
no problem , i enjoy talking in my sleep .
can i come in ?
oh it 's nothing . i knew it . i told roberto `` he 's very good that little frenchman , very good '' . i lost my title but i won a watch !
no . thank you . it 's really beautiful .
you do n't have that one , do you ?
yes .
you still collect them ?
little presents , nothing much ... i knew it , i just knew it ! look here !
what is it ?
here ... here ...
the dolphins are n't the only ones who do n't feel very good sometimes .
what ?
you do n't need a stretcher to take her with you . you know that , do n't you ?
good night .
driving is n't the problem , it 's remembering the right road .
hey ! will you slow down ! when did you learn how to drive ?
... i 'm listening .
no , i have to ask you a favor ... you 're the only one who 'll understand .
because pasta should be eaten `` al dente '' . so the trinket will just have to wait a bit .
tell me , why do n't you go and get your medal ?
look at me . these are n't lungs . these are ... tanks . how long can you hold your breath ?
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it !
as i said , second of all you 're too skinny . you 've got tiny lungs . i still do n't understand how you can dive without getting sick .
two years younger than you .
if we do n't ... i 'm going to beat you .
why ?
well ... about everything .
everything about what ?
... everything .
no ... it depends ... sometimes they are ... what , exactly do you want to know ?
why ? are they what 's most important ?
ah ha . you finally want to know about women .
today at lunch , you asked me if i had any questions .
... for the mermaids .
why ?
then , it 's very chic . avanti !
no .
get in the car !
i 'm a little tired , i do n't know if ...
c'mon , you two ... jacques , we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight . we have a new world champion .
... and his friend , johana ...
madame ...
ahi , ahi , cazzo ! ma mamia ! where ... ? god , she 'll kill me ... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant .
your mother ?
what ?
enzo ?
you 're staying at the hotel ?
not at all !
no , no !
forget it . i was joking .
people say that ?
damn right ! that 's what i tell them when people say you 've turned into a fish .
exactly , i mean , after all , we 're men !
so , not married . well , good for you . you play the field , like me . a girl in every port , huh ?
me neither , 'cause of my mother . she 's a curse , my mamma , a tornado . stubborn as a mule ! i was engaged ... for a week . after that , mamma was so mad , i tell you , pasta was bouncing off the walls .
no .
... you married ?
it 's okay .
how do you make a living ? your experiments , does it pay well ?
that 's good .
i 'm sorry ... i do n't know how to ask the questions .
well , what are they ?
yes , of course . lots of questions .
... so , after all these years , you must have lots of questions to ask . am i right ?
enzo drop it , i 'll find something .
not only is jacques mayol a very special friend , but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world ! and you 're throwing him out ! are you crazy , or what ? stupido !
it 's okay , enzo . i 'll go somewhere else .
you do n't have a room ? paolo ? what did i just hear ? i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger ? !
i do n't have one .
what room have you got ?
i remember . hi roberto !
that 's too easy ! every time i beat a record there 's always some dumbshit asking me : `` d'you know that french guy , mayol ? he 's supposed to be very good ! too bad he does n't compete . '' so , you 're going to come with me to taormina ! first , because you 're my friend and second , because you do n't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure . ... i 'll see you there ...
you 're the best , enzo !
no . all you need is to want to be the best .
i do n't want to be in any competition ... i dive because i like to , not to beat a record ... do n't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him ?
because i 'm sure you 're dying to beat me .
why ?
they say i 'm like lazarus . you know , the guy who was raised from the dead ? !
great !
i dove 315 feet !
yes , i know .
that 's good . you never would have recognized me , huh ? check out the suit ! looking good , no ? you know i 'm the world champion ?
enzo ...
jacques , my friend , how are you ?
if you did mind , you 'd tell me , would n't you ?
no ...
you do n't mind if i go instead , do you ?
fine !
well , if it is n't the little frenchman ! how is the little frenchman ?
the guy in the halloween suit !
who ?
would it be out of place to ask what he 's doing ?
... both . did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles ?
tea ... or whiskey ?
yes , thank you . intravenous if possible .
a drink to warm up ?
does anybody live to make a second ?
yeah ... sure ... is this your first trip to peru ?
do n't you have a heater ?
promise you wo n't forget me .
anything .
promise me one thing .
you are the father .
that 's good ... that 's wonderful . it 's wonderful for you .
jacques ? i 'm pregnant .
i saw how it has to be .
you 've got to tell me what happened ?
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again ... and i always have a hard time finding one .
why ?
... the feeling of slipping without falling ... the hardest is once you are at the bottom .
... when you dive ... with that machine ... what does it feel like ?
no , i 'll be fine . can you just hand me a glass of water ?
you want to lie down for a while ?
it 's nothing . just the long trip . i 'm a little jet-lagged .
what 's wrong ?
you go back , i 'll walk .
jacques ... ?
i 'm putting you on the coin ... your essence ... that way you 'll always be with me when i dive .
what are you doing ?
... nothing .
what ?
i do n't know ... it did n't feel right . i 'm going to bed . i 'm tired .
you 'll try again tomorrow ?
i did n't dive .
and you ?
i 'm very pleased to meet you , uncle louis .
uncle louis . he 's a 75 year old amazing guy , is n't he ?
bonjour monsieur ... louis .
you 'll understand .
why did you take me to the hotel , if you live here .
okay . in that case ... i 'm at the airport in nice .
absolutely positive .
you sure ?
... not at all .
i 'm being a pain , huh ?
it 's me again .
hello ?
you go down to the bottom of the sea , where the water is n't even blue anymore , where the sky is only a memory ... and you float there , quietly , quietly and stay there ... and you decide that you will die for them ... only then do they start coming out . they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them ... if it 's sincere . if it 's pure ... they will be with you and take you away forever .
no ... tell me .
do you know how it is ? do you know what you 're supposed to do to meet a mermaid ?
uh ... ah ! a story ?
then , tell me a story .
... it 's hard you know . you 're so far away and i do n't know what else to say .
well , then , talk to me some more .
i 'm still here .
so have i . ... hello ?
... that 's funny ... i had this job with enzo ... we got fired too .
i got fired .
how are you ?
it 's me ... johana .
hello ?
but it 's not true , i feel good with you ... it feels right ...
yes you do . you know exactly what i 'm talking about . you 're afraid i want to hold onto you , and i do , but you 're not ready ... at least not for me .
i 'm not from the sea ... i do n't understand what you 're talking about .
because one should n't fall in love with creatures from the sea .
why ?
i 'm going back home .
are n't you happy ? do n't you feel proud ... ? i feel proud and all i did was watch .
i did ?
jacques , you set a world record .
uh ... yes , of course !
can i come watch you dive tomorrow ?
i do n't know , i just feel it .
how do you know that ?
she 's not like the others . she ca n't stand to be away from the sea .
... the way she moves .
how can you tell it 's a female ?
no ? huh ? yes , of course ! !
... no ?
you ... you would n't want to spend the day with me ?
i 'd better get back now .
i 'm glad you stayed . thank you .
just checking up on your family . i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress ... well ...
give it to me .
well , water is n't exactly the best thing for pictures ... not even for pictures of dolphins ...
no . i want to show you . is it ruined ?
my wallet .
only to help the medics , i assure you .
you jumped in ?
lucky i was there to save you .
please move slowly , you 're rocking the boat .
... especially the sneakers .
thank you ...
you look adorable .
it 's too loud for me .
i thought you 'd be at the dinner .
maybe on earth there is one ... but not when you dive ... you see , to dive deep into the sea , for no reason ... just to do it . it 's a feeling ... i do n't know how to say this ... voluptuous ?
i guess ... but you know ... i 'm american and i 've mostly been taught to be competitive ... there 's always pleasure of being the best ?
yes ... maybe ... i do n't know . i do n't like competitions ... it ruins the fun . do n't you think ?
just because ... i would have liked to visit the town ... see the coast ... i do n't know anybody ... expect for you .
i do n't know ... why ?
you 're going to be very busy these days are n't you ?
i 'm being a pain in the ass . it 's beautiful here .
i thought it was a nice place . is n't it ?
thanks for helping with the bag . it looks great !
... okay . i 'll try .
no , no . you 'll like it . it 's superb .
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo . i work for an insurance company . so , i decided to take a few days off . i do n't know this island at all . it really is gorgeous .
but what brought you to sicily ?
thank you . i would n't want to interrupt anything .
please , have a seat .
no ... in the hut .
in the lake ?
we saw each other a little while ago .
i recognize you .
ah ? !
no sir , the hotel is full because of the diving championship .
yes , but ... so , you have n't got a room left ?
yes sir , and it has been so for 127 years .
this is the hotel san domenico ?
positive , sir .
... are you sure ?
mayol ... mayol ... no reservation .
that 's different ! what 's the matter with you ?
louis , we were french !
what were italians doing living in greece anyway ?
the whale ! how could i forget ? always was something fishy about that woman !
uncle louis , you remember enzo 's mother signora molinari from amorgos ?
i 'm going to put a lock on the telephone . did you bring the cassettes ?
uncle louis , we have a guest !
liar ! thief ! torturer ! when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast .
it 's my apartment .
in my apartment ?
well ... here .
good . that way i 'll see more of you ... where are you going to stay ?
no , no . it 's true . when i was in new york , oh boy ! before my accident , you understand ?
uncle louis !
he does n't hear too well .
what kind of name is that ? to be named after a city ?
johana ... new york .
where are you from , henrietta ?
no , no . johana is visiting me .
are you crazy ? i have no use for a woman ! since my accident .
i brought johana to meet you .
did you buy the cassettes ? the wagner , the berlioz ?
uncle louis , this is my friend johana .
assassin !
where i saw the mermaids ? ! why do n't you ever ask any question ? i 'm always the one asking the question ! we 're sitting here like two stones and i 'm taking to myself . ask me something , goddamnit !
what ?
why do n't you ask me ?
no .
hey ! have you ever seen a mermaid ?
then you should n't eat everyday , jacques .
you should n't dive everyday , papa .
vitamins , exercise , herb tea ... and see a doctor , will ya ?
do you think i should have stayed ? do n't you think maybe i should have stayed ? i 've been a jerk , right ? i should have stayed ! i was supposed to be in love ... i was in love ! i am in love , why did i act like a bitch ? he went swimming . all the man did was go swimming ! i must be crazy . it was too good to be true .
what is it honey ... the frenchy ?
i know , i know ! i 'm a terrible person ... it 's ... i 'm so damn , damn sad .
you look it too . you have n't been working out , you have n't been taking your vitamins ! you have n't been drinking your herbs , you have n't been ...
no . i 'm just depressed .
does that have a hidden meaning ?
way past it .
... and if we repaint the walls , we 'll need new curtains , you put the painters on you visa and i 'll do the curtains on american express ... for the couch there 's bloomingdales ... or are you still over your limit ?
do n't be a jerk . there 's no such thing as love at first sight .
... since eight o'clock last night ... ! you 're in love .
have n't you been listening ?
i thought you said he was peruvian ?
oh jesus ... ! i 'll make some coffee . they left the stove .
it 's his heartbeat .
okay ... who 'd you meet ?
nice ... very interesting ... great ! ... i guess .
how was your trip ?
what ?
well ?
they 're going to send detectives .
you called the police ?
yep . how was your trip ... ? help me clean up , okay ?
i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time ?
... and the new stereo .
they got the new t.v .
again ?
you 're back ! hello . we were burgled .
... sally ?
i changed the lock you son of a bitch !
yes ... it 's magic .
but does n't jacques dive without anything ?
that is n't for the divers actually . it 's for the balloon . it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator . without it , with the pressure at the bottom , the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed .
what 's that little air bottle on the machine ?
those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet . they dive with a helium-oxygen mixture . at that depth , compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide .
... and those ?
of course , that 's what they 're for .
if there was a problem , they could do something right ?
they 're paramedics . they wait at 180 feet .
what are they for ?
let him sleep .
i 'll go see how he 's doing .
... yes ?
wait ! professor ... ?
then , goodbye .
you 've made me a happy insurance person .
okay , okay . you 'll have it by the end of the week , how 's that ?
okay , listen , just get the custom 's office to send me a copy as fast as possible . we ca n't send you new equipment until our file is complete . okay ?
his mother 's an american . he spent half of his life in the states . i 'd try english if i were you .
will he understand spanish ?
coffee might be nice .
should n't somebody take him a blanket or something ?
for one thing , it 's his job ... as for the rest of it , i wish i knew .
why is he doing this ?
it depends . he should come up soon . unless he 's decided to stay for the night .
how long can he stay down ? without breathing ?
he 's in the fluoroscope now . listen to his heart . impressive , huh ? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and does n't even feed the limbs anymore . it 's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins ... until now .
he is n't going to breathe .
but ... how is he going to breathe ?
my dear , science is a cruel mistress .
in the spring when he melts !
i 'll have to talk to the driver .
... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse . we were n't able to save the equipment .
that 's the experiment ? dumping a guy into a frozen lake ?
mayol ... jacques mayol .
who ... who is that ?
i know sir . i wo n't let you down .
hammer , the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands .
there wo n't be any need for that sir .
i love her sir . if i do n't help you , i wo n't be able to make her my wife . mohammed ali paula abdul rahim has agreed to come with me to the north pole on a rescue mission .
please . will you help me ?
my esther ! oh mordechai .
it 's esther . santa 's got her .
so why the long face ?
no way , it 's too dangerous . besides , my days of hooking are over .
take esther with you , you 'll need the backup .
looks like i got a plane to catch .
about an hour ago , we received this transmission from the north pole .
what 's up ?
mordechai . thank god you 're here .
one last thing hammer . you take care of yourself . the ...
good thinking . we 'll disguise ourselves as a gentile couple to pass undetected . now that he thinks i 'm dead , this should be a piece of homentashen .
well , then i 've got good news for you . we just got word that he 'll be making an appearance at the mall of america today . i 'm sending esther to meet you there at once .
it was a trap . i 'm back at square one .
that 'll work . get them out to the jewish community stat . we got an epidemic on our hands .
you mean you want us to make copies of yentl , fiddler on the roof , and chaim potok 's the chosen ?
chief , it 's me . listen carefully . i need for the worldwide jewish media conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive jewish protagonist as its lead .
i 'm gon na pay a visit to the k.l.f . see if they 've got the 411 on santa 's location . i 'll check in with you when i know more .
what 's your first move ?
i guess i could be chalant about it , but then again i 'm not even sure if that 's a word . listen chief , we could stand around arguing all day , but i got ta case to crack .
hey , it 's your bar mitzvah . i 'm just readin ' the torah portion .
a settlement completely demolished , ten smashed army jeeps , four dead arabs . g dash d damn it , hammer ! you think you 're above the ten commandments ? just find santa claus and bring him back to us . no heroics , got it ?
i got the job done did n't i ? i did what i had to do .
alright mordechai , now that we 're alone i just want to say that i 'm not happy about this . i do n't want a repeat of that incident in the west bank .
well , i could n't be happier for the both of you .
well , for starters , we 're going to honeymoon in boca for a week . and then , when we get back , morty 's been talking about taking a stable , good paying job as a consultant for the jdl .
he works too much . god forbid he should have a nice jewish girl come eat by him once in a while . take his mind off his work . maybe a blowjob here and there .
what do you want me to do ?
hanukkah , shmanukkah . it is n't even one of the high holidays . what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty , and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl . i 'll make you a deal . i 'll help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai .
he 's ... he 's very nice . but mrs. carver , the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands . please , you have to help me .
you like my mordechai , yes ?
from the story of purim . well , now that we 're all acquainted , let 's sit down and start the sabbath .
it 's esther .
so . do you have a name ?
we go to the same temple .
you two know each other ?
mordechai !
esther !
mordechai !
esther !
i forgive you .
i love you too . i 'm sorry about freaking out yesterday . i was wrong .
mordechai , i love you . i could n't let you do this alone .
what are you doing here ?
i 'm sorry esther , i just do n't think we can see each other romantically anymore .
we do !
no . it 's not like that . you 're being completely neurotic . i was just playing along ...
oh my god . she 's become my pimp . and she 's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder .
relax morty , i think your mom is wonderful . she cares so much about you . get this , while you were gone she said she 'd help me get you to work with the jdl if i 'd come eat by you once in awhile . like i needed any incentive to be with you . she 's so ...
when did you guys have this conversation ? when i was in the bathroom ? what else did she have to say ?
oh , she said that , did she ? what else did mommy dearest have to say ?
your mother was right . you do work too hard .
kiss me you semitic stud !
also , on a daily basis , i want you to tell me what to do , where to do it , and how i should live my life .
afterwards they 'll make the decision as to whether or not they 'd like to continue their religious studies in israel . because , hey , after all we 'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing , sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism .
keep going .
i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons . little abraham will go to stanford for college , batya will go ivy league , maybe vassar .
oh . okay .
i want you to talk dirty to me .
yes esther .
mordechai ?
you mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke ... oh . i get it .
maybe we should try a different kind of dancing .
sorry . i 'm better with men .
oh !
i said , yeah , about once a week !
what ! ?
i said , do you come here often ! ?
what was that ! ?
sure . why not .
want to get a drink ?
now we wait for santa to make his next move .
so , now what ?
yeah , no kidding .
that got annoying fairly quickly .
c'mon follow me .
what are we going to do ? we 're at least an hour from the front .
he must be behind that curtain . relax . we 're undercover . we need to give off the appearance of calm . you see esther , the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in . act as a gentile would .
any sign of santa ?
i do n't think i could eat another latke if you paid me .
oy vey , i 'm stuffed .
i 'm sorry to hear about santa . he was a good friend , but my days ...
mordechai , santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian . the man 's a demon . there 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of .
your mother ? oh . whoops .
actually , his days of marital infidelity have long since past . now he just shtoops my mother exclusively .
how is old chief bloomenbergensteinenthal ? is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on ?
my name is esther . chief bloomenbergensteinenthal from the jewish defense league desperately needs to speak with you .
client notes . sorry . what can i do for you ?
sorry i 'm late . traffic was a pisher , and i 've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking . what are you listening to ?
from the way she carried herself i could tell she 'd been around the block a few times ...
please , call me mordechai .
mr. jefferson carver ?
what a good poop you made in your diaper mazel tov ! that 's right ! mommy loves you ! such a good boy you are !
mom ! we 're eating !
... i 'm not finished yet , mom .
hello mazel tov ! a boojee boojee boojee boo ...
mazel tov !
well i have news for you mom . it is good enough ... i 'm good enough and i wo n't leave here until i hear you tell me ...
... so you saved hanukkah mr. big shot . i mean , let 's be honest mordechai , it is n't even one of the high holidays .
... and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels , and light the menorah with the knowl ...
well i 'm just glad you 're safe bubba shaina , and eating by your mother for shabos .
... and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the jewish community .
mom , why do n't you put that cat out of its misery ?
let 's let your tuchus breathe .
do what you must .
no . no . we 're gon na argue . and you know what mom ? i 'm going to save hanukkah just to spite you . and when my face is all over the television . when your friends are opening their hanukkah gifts next year , do n't mention it to them , okay ? i would n't want you to have to show my picture .
i do n't want to argue with you . let 's just eat in peace .
you know my friend maureen ? her son , the investment banker ? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton . what a mench he is . instead of schleping to save hanukkah , god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba . maybe then you could send me to boca , too .
so do n't show a picture .
when i play bridge with all the girls , everyone has what to talk about with their sons . they show pictures . their sons are lawyers and doctors and rabbis . why ca n't i show a picture ?
mom , i have a real job . i do good things for this community . i help people .
mom , stop with this already . of course i love you . you 're my mother .
mordechai . do you love your mother ?
i can see . and you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us .
shabat shalom mama . i brought some manischewitz . the black label .
i 'll be in my office .
i understand that . i just thought that you might want to know .
but we 're not open on sundays .
yeah , i 'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on sunday . i have a terrible yeast infection and i need to see my gynecologist .
anything else ?
she said to remind you that you 're having shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz .
okay , what 's the information ?
happy hanukkah morty .
happy hanukkah tikva .
everything 's kosher . watch him for me .
hammer , you alright ?
offscreen gunfire . that jewish atomic clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget .
what are you doing ?
well that 's good news for us . it means the system is outdated . this should be easy . c'mon .
listen cat , i 'll have you know that i hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player .
the alarm will trigger if the system detects any non-w.a.s.p . tendencies inside the building . for example , if you were to dribble a basketball , or eat watermelon , or use the word dawg ... that is , spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o ... within the confines of this workshop , the alarm would sound .
how do we bypass it ?
take a look .
a stereo type alarm system ?
wait ! before we enter , you need to know that my research has determined that santa 's compound is wired with the xp 2000 stereo type alarm system .
just praying to god that we do n't kill ourselves going over this wall .
what are you doing ?
oh yeah . take a look .
porno ? you 're tellin ' me that you can get porno on that thing ?
but wait , there 's more . with a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface , commonly referred to as a mouse , i can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail .
man , that 's far out ! hey , the jets won !
now this might get a bit technical , but try and stay with me . using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators , called the internet , i can access surveillance maps , villian biographical information , and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter .
cool . what 's it do ?
i wanted to ask you , how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santa 's workshop ? we 've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years .
it 's gon na be tough , but the back entrance looks like our best bet .
he 's still working out some identity issues .
what 's wrong with him ?
it 's cool . it 's cool . aveenooh shalom alechem , brother .
okay , look . i 'm going to work really , really hard on this one . but , please stop with the pressure . i 'm already tense as it is .
you watch your back hammer . hanukkah might just be his first move . for all we know kwanzaa could be next . there 's a lot of brothers counting on you . if you fail ...
not if i can help it . you got any information for me ?
oh . it means that santa 's gon na fuck hanukkah 's shit up .
actually , i ... i do n't . what does that mean ?
oh , most definitely . got the brothers here in full alert mode .
i 'm back on the job for the jdl . you hear about that crazy white boy who took over as santa ?
so morde-chai , tell me , what brings your bad self down to the klf ?
hah ! jewish guilt . well , it wo n't work on me hammer . i 'm too strong for it .
i shlepped all the way to the north pole for this ? i come to fight you , and you do n't even put out anything to nosh on ? what kind of arch nemesis are you ?
i do n't have to tell you anything hammer ! you 're gon na have to kill me before i tell you !
where 's my girlfriend santa ?
in fact , he 's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling christmas this year .
hey everybody . how 's it hangin ' ?
i 'm just calming the kiddies . there 's no need to worry about santa . he 's just having a peaceful , adult conversation with his nice jewish friend , the hebrew hammer .
what are you doing ?
whoa , whoa there . c'mon mordechai , is this any way to treat an old family friend ? let 's cut out all the unpleasantness . i admit , i went way overboard with the whole hanukkah thing . let me make it up to you . how about a peace offering ? girls .
what 's your shpiel , santa ?
the hebrew hammer ! you 're alive .
let me guess , you 're the goy who stole hanukkah .
excuse me ? do i know you , friend ? take a look around you . do you even know who i am ?
if you keep your mouth shut and come with me , you wo n't get hurt .
sorry folks , i do n't do couples .
no dipshit , i want you to kill him .
you want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever , buy him clothing he 'll never wear , and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy was n't looking ?
it 's friday .
what day is it ?
resting ?
well , he 's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend .
take a look .
maybe he ran out of ammo .
what 's going on ? why 'd he stop ?
what are we gon na do ? he 's got us on the ropes .
get off of me you cripple !
i do n't know . why do n't you ask them sir .
no . i 'm airsick you asshole ! where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly ?
you okay ?
thanks . oh , did i tell you . i picked up that new kc and the sunshine band record that you recommended . you were right , it is good .
no , it was the perfect level .
i was n't too over the top ?
it was good . very chilling , but you still got all the points across that we talked about .
so , how was i ?
that 's some cold shit .
bootleg copies of the frank capra classic , 'it 's a wonderful life . '
worse .
so what 's in the boxes ? heroin ? cocaine ?
oh , that 's the beauty of it . these are free samples .
what should i charge ?
while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems , i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive , jewish pride weakening substance on the planet . i bought the entire plant .
so , what 's our first plan of attack santa ?
you get your money from your husband .
what about me ?
this is for `` mama and the kids . ''
drink your beer and do n't get so excited .
why do you ask so many questions ? what difference does it make how carlos and i feel ? feeling does not buy clothes and houses !
i do n't know -
is he in love with you ?
nice fellow ?
mmmyes .
good looking ?
nobody . a boy who works in a grocery .
who 's carlos dom-what's-his-name ?
maybe i should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent , huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh , like carlos dominguez - - and get fat and -
why not -- if you like it - if that 's what you really want .
i ca n't understand that fancy talk . you mean i 'm a gold-digger ? sure , i 'm a gold-digger -- why not ?
when you marry champagne , clo-clo , you ca n't trade it in for beer . you 're stuck with it .
that depends . how much money has he ?
my soninlaw . what do you think of him ?
why not ?
is someone with you -- can i get you a drink ?
and my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more .
of course , not , charlie . i never thought you did .
now i know i did n't hurt nobody when i was drunk - -
that 's just it , charlie . that 's what i 'm driving at . you could do anything in that time .
i do n't know .
but between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours , what happens , charlie ?
i sleep it off .
then what do you do ?
and when you drink , you get drunk .
i drink .
oh , i 'm only exploring your theory . let 's take a step further . you drink , do n't you , charlie ?
if a leopard did n't do it , who did ?
you know -- not scared enough . nothing to scare it .
well , charlie , just why do you think your cat did n't kill the contreras girl ?
it do n't look like a leopard to me .
here is something that should interest charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago . they used it in ceremonies . the jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites .
that 's the place : i remember - my feet were so darn sore , i could n't make it -- and galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
and here is three tree mesa -- and here i go out of the big arroyo --
what arroyo - how did you get to it
north -- in an arroyo , shot through the head - maybe week ago . no good , skin , everything gone
where ? where did you find it ?
what 's left of him .
you found the leopard !
two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
i do n't know . i want him to lock me up .
look , charlie , you did n't do it , and you know you did n't .
i want him to lock me up .
what do you want to see him for ?
i do n't know . i want to see robles .
no , he was n't kidding . i 'm sick . claw women ? hurt little girls ? no !
here have a cigarette . he was only kidding .
i 'm sick .
yes , i was drunk , mr. manning .
charlie was n't drunk last night .
no . i 'm serious about this .
sure !
but he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl .
sure , i like my leopards
up at the museum .
where 's that man ?
let 's get in your truck .
sure .
i 'd like one of them to say it to you , charlie . i 'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons . want to hear them ?
they do n't say it to me .
they all say the cat killed this second girl .
that cat ai n't mean . i feed him out of my own hand for six years . why do n't he kill me ? at night in the truck , i let him out of the cage . when i am falling asleep i hear him walking back and forth . i go to sleep . he do n't hurt me .
you really think so , charlie ?
no , sir . that girl in the cemetery ? my cat did n't kill that girl . i told you cats do n't go around looking for trouble . if that cat 's alive , it 's out in the country hiding under a bush , starving to death .
look , charlie , just be patient . i 'll fix everything . you do n't want that cat , anyway . it killed two people .
ca n't make a buck without my leopard . i tell you , mr. manning , you got ta find that cat for me -- or pay up .
tomorrow -
see you tomorrow -
maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
the death card - -
let me see it
do n't look at it !
go on -
something black - something on its way to you
what are you doing that for ?
cut .
the elderly man i told you about .
who ?
well -- did he give you a lot of money ?
watch and see , a day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
you and your cards . meet a rich man ! i look for them with money . what rich man has n't money . and for what was i born if it was n't for money ? you 're not telling me anything .
you 'll meet a rich man and he will give , you money .
what did they say before the bad card came up ?
all men are fools . they like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
they 're fools . why do n't they let charlie how-come hunt it alone . he 's an indian .
) they buried teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time . but they did n't get him .
i saw teresa . maybe i was the last to see her except perhaps her mamacita and her little brother . i was going past --
it 's a blackcard and bad card , but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things .
i suppose so . i suppose it will be different for us , too when everyone knows . then we will be just like other people . but these last weeks will always be our secret a lovely secret to remember all our lives .
love is different for different people .
when you are going to see pedro , does your heart beat until you tremble ?
what , senorita ?
rosita i have wondered -
pedro is waiting for me , too .
at four . he will be there at four .
you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father 's grave ...
he will be waiting ...
i 'll miss you too , honey --
hey i 'm over here .
oh , dear -- i do n't know what i 'm going to do without you - honestly , i do n't
i bet you try on my coffin some day -- i hope it `` fits just perfect . ''
and if you 've got cold feet honey , ill take over for you . that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me .
i know . i know . you 've got the talent . i got the breaks .
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl .
maybe . for three years i 've sung in rats ' nests , while jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance . we 're due for a little luck !
you 're lucky . i wish he 'd front page for me .
why not ? he 's a good press agent and a good friend . besides , we 've shared a lot of headaches
you think be 's pretty nice , do n't you ?
yes . so i 've noticed . jerry 's noticed - he 'll come up with something .
she 's a local . when the dudes come out to new mexico , they went to wallow in latin glamour . this is a bad town for blondes .
it may sound like music to her -- i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower . click click click .
well , now that you 've had your history lesson , i think i 'll get on to the museum .
oh , that 's so interesting !
it 's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they wo n't ever forget that a peaceful village of indians was wiped out by the conquistadores , back in the 17th century ... a band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths that 's what this procession is supposed to be .
you know all about these things - - and i 've lived here all my life - and i still do n't know what the procession means .
good evening .
oh , mr. galbraith ! i 'm so glad you 're here .
i did n't want to kill , but i had to . i heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
then you found the leopard --
i could n't rest - i could n't sleep . all i could see was teresa delgado 's body -- broken -- mangled . i saw it day and night . it was waiting everywhere i turned .
tormented -- ? why ?
why do yo & amp ; i accuse me ? you do n't know what you 're doing -- you do n't understand -- nobody understands --
tell me .
it 's better you do n't know .
consuelo screamed too -- and clo clo . why did you do it ? why ? quick . tell me why ?
i did n't do anything . she screamed . something frightened her .
you shot the leopard . we know that . you killed consuelo . you killed clo clo . then tonight --
not ! i tell you . no !
it was you .
no .
it was you , galbraith !
you 've thought of all this before . you know it is n't the leopard do n't you ?
no . he would be a hard man to find , jerry . particularly if he were a clever men . he would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him .
could n't you tell a man like that when you saw him ?
he 'd act normally when he was with other people . it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over .
i do n't mean that . how would he act ? what would he do ?
to the eye ? like other men .
if there were a man like that , with a kink in his brain around here loose , what would he be like .
yes . there have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure . there was blue beard in france -- jack the ripper in london . it 's not uncommon .
all right -- the dead , then . in history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
but all those fancy courses were about the dead , jerry , not the living .
you know a lot . you 've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that ?
just barely possible - - yes .
you must admit it 's possible that it might have been a man .
some other time .
do n't you want to see the rest of the exhibit ?
come on , charlie . let 's go find another and better suspect .
you , charlie -- you know leopards . you might have had an old claw around somewhere , and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh ?
i do n't know .
yes , but what sort of a man ?
a hunch -- that 's all i 've got about this leopard thing . it 's just a hunch , yet i feel it deep in the stomach . it was a man !
we had given up digging in a certain barrow . i went back and i tried again . i just had a hunch .
but he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair .
some crazy guy .
i can understand what you mean - demented men , pathological cases . but what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard ?
there are all sorts of men . you get to see some funny ones as a reporter .
it could be . why would a man kill her ? for what ? it was n't robbery . it was n't a crime of jealousy or passion . she had no enemies .
it could be a man .
charlie likes his leopard .
charlie does n't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery .
yes .
about charlie 's leopard ?
charlie and i were talking . that 's one reason i wanted to see you .
i 'll take you about . got some nice things .
more or less .
come to look around ?
we 're old friends .
you know charlie how-come ?
i can understand about the cat killing the first girl . charlie how come told me . all that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything . last night there was nothing to disturb it . just a little girl alone in a cemetery .
just a minute , robles . let him go on .
caged animals are unpredictable . they 're like frustrated human beings . i ca n't answer your question .
but it does n't eat what it kills .
it does n't know how to hunt its natural prey .
why ?
jerry , i talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard . this leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with charlie how come for years and years.. that 's why it kills human beings .
that 's what i do n't understand -- why should it come here -- and why did n't it stay here ? it 's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt .
sure -- certainly - but what 's that got to do with this ?
it does n't jibe with this you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it would n't stay in the city
yes ?
doc -- something you said the other day --
do n't feel so concerned , jerry .
that 's right , of course .
there is no danger at all . it 's a wild animal . do you think a wild animal prefers walls , streets and people when it can get into open country ?
no . i 'm quite sure .
you know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back ?
of course . it 's the way any decent man would feel in your position .
yes . i want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody .
you 're worrying about its killing someone else ?
it 's about the leopard .
i want to ask you something .
well , i 'd best be off .
yes . it 's always fascinated me . you know , once , when i was a youngster , i went to see mrs. leslie carter in `` zaza . '' after the play i stood in the alley just to watch her come out .
show business ?
no - really , i can see them -- they 're coming now - turn off the lights
wait
they do , but -- there are no lights out there - they 'll just be shadows -
i thought they came right past here
of course . only i 'm afraid you 'll be cheated . there is n't much of a view of the procession here .
miss walker -- i did n't expect anyone
i 've disturbed you . i 'm sorry -
thanks .
i 'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming , miss walker , you have nothing to worry about .
well , i 'm next . you wo n't hear anything like that , mr. galbraith . i 'm not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose .
that was a calamity !
that was unfortunate .
well , i 'm hardly mrs. leslie carter whoever she was . in fact , i 'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on jerry 's little publicity stunt with the leopard .
so you see meeting you is a real thrill for me .
various reasons . but i ca n't see why you 'd be interested in the rather dusty career of william galbraith teacher , naturalist , curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself .
why did you give up teaching ?
there 's a little museum here in town . they 've hired me to run it , we 've some interesting exhibits of indian arts and crafts . it 's fun -- and i like living here in new mexico .
what do you do now ?
to know where that leopard went - i 'm afraid you 'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard . i was a naturalist . that hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards . i used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back east . i gave that up .
jerry told me you were an expert with animals , mr. galbraith . could n't you tell where it went ?
offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit ? no . i 'm in office to protect the taxpayers money not throw it way . come on , charlie .
you wo n't go to galbraith with me ?
yes . and i am taking it to headquarters for examination .
that 's a fact , is n't it ?
i am not interested in what somebody else thinks . you being me facts and i 'll act on them .
galbraith knows something . he as good as said so
i 'm sure of it !
you think galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse .
chief , do n't you understand what this means ?
ask kiki . ask any woman . girls do n't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark , lonely street unless they 're with a man or expecting a man .
why ?
yes . the lipstick .
professional hunters , who rid the state of cougars .
state hunters ?
no . he was kidding charlie .
let me get one thing clear . did galbraith make a direct accusation ?
i 've been trying to tell him , sheriff . he wo n't listen to me .
nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time .
what are you getting at ?
i know all that , chief , and i do n't like it any better than you do , but there 's something else --
yes , there is something wrong . people who want publicity and do n't mind how they get it -- what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
something 's wrong with this whole setup --
that 's why it just mauls and tears at them .
it 's not for me . i 'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot .
go on foot .
i have n't done any posse work since last time i rode with toni mix at the old bijou theatre -- aged six , if you 're interested ,
thanks , sheriff .
you can go now , manning . there is no way we can hold you legally responsible .
kiki , galbraith said something to me once , -- something you ought to know . we were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel -- they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves . that 's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way .
it 's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened .
we ought to dare to tell each other everything , kiki -- you and i .
jerry , i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside - where it matters . i wanted it that day too , but did n't dare tell you .
i know . what do you think i felt when you said , `` do n't be soft ? ''
i hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead .
i know -- teresa -
we stood here once before .
it 's all right . i 'm not hurt .
kiki ?
we will
no . no , thanks . now we 've got to do it ourselves .
how do you know ?
half to the delgado family and half to clo-clo 's family .
all right , i 'm not ashamed of it ! i split it two ways
eloise does n't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check , kicks .
i -- i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise --
what ! you ca n't be --
as a matter of fact , i 'm out of cash myself .
that 's funny -- i never knew you to lose that much before --
i got into a little crap game .
did n't you take your cut out of the closing check ?
oh , by the way -- i 'm out of cash --
i 'm no detective . i do n't even know how to begin . all i know is i want to do something about all this .
you already know the answer to that . i want this town to be safe and happy again --
absolutely sure .
you 're positive of that , are n't you ?
kiki -- it was n't the leopard .
if that 's being a softie -- there are two of us .
confession . i 'm a complete softie . i 've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
maybe there ought to be less racket and more us .
i 'm glad you care about us , kicks . sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
you . us .
what else do you care about , kicks ?
that does n't make sense .
maybe i want to feel badly .
why do you want to stay around here ? it 'll only make you feel badly .
robles says it looks that way . belmonte had already been there and left . they only missed each other by a few minutes .
and she waited here for him ?
yes . do you mind ?
you mean you want to take them to the cemetery .
jerry , these flowers are n't really for me
yes .
i know . funerals .
pretty . you know -- it 's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now .
he 's a nice guy . vie ought to keep in touch with him .
that was nice of mr. galbraith .
do they close up every year for this processionist business ?
i can use them .
and not a sign of the leopard ?
as long as my feet held out .
you remember the fellow this morning -- galbraith . you 've got time before the supper show .
who is he ?
forget it . i 'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me , a nice guy . come along he 'll get a great kick out of meeting you .
our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
the whole town 's in a state , kiki doors locked , people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night
it must be the altitude you , bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
and did you find the leopard ?
yeah .
well , does everybody love us now ? you 've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors !
we all , had to look at the body . it was awful , kiki -- awful !
what did he have to do - look at the body ?
i do n't know a witness . he seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony .
who was the other man ?
and i suppose you do n't feel bad !
i suppose he was trying to make me feel bad .
do n't be soft .
suppose i slip them a few bucks for the funeral expenses .
now look what you 've done .
are you all right ?
the red dress ? no . my black one . then i 'll be just like him .
you look swell in that threealarm number --
i thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act .
clo-clo ?
and i never will -- you know what 's between us - we 're a thing -- but this is serious -- big competition .
no not yet .
almost three years , is n't it ? and have i ever done anything to hurt you ?
this is l939 . ca n't you subtract ?
look , kicks , how long have we known each other ?
you 're too good to me .
no . i thought that might be just a little corny . i want you to lead him in on a leash .
on his back , i suppose .
i thought - is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life . no . not my favorite client . she 's going to make an entrance this town will never forget .
that 's easy . me .
listen , kicks , you 'll never guess what i 've cooked up this time .
makes no difference . get him out .
kiki - he wo n't hurt you . there 's nothing to be afraid of .
get it out of here !
and i never will- you know what 's between us we 're a thing but this is serious competition .
no - not yet .
look , kicks , have i ever done anything to hurt you ?
you 're too good to me .
no . i thought that might be just a little corny . i want you to lead him in on a leash .
on his back , i suppose .
i thought -- is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life . no . not my favorite client . she 's going to make an entrance this town will never forget !
that 's easy . me .
listen , kicks , you 'll never guess what i 've cooked up this tine ...
makes no difference . get him out !
kiki -- he wo n't hurt you . there 's nothing to be afraid of .
get it out of here !
you a tourist ?
ha-ha ... yeah ... what about that road back there , though ? it says closed to the public , doesnt it ?
maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the getty museum ...
nobody ? huh ! ... how come ?
aint nobody out there , mister .
all those soldiers out there ... getting bored , thirsty . come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps ?
must it ?
hot ... these roads all round here , closed to the public ... whys that ? military bases ? huh . i guess theres space enough for war games ... must be good for business .
dial o-o-o on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink , sir .
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard , eh ? her brothers death .
no . thank you . ill be fine ...
you will have to ask mr de moraes that , sir . would you like a drink while you wait ?
you wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together , would you ?
i work here , sir . im here most of the time .
by the way , laurence , were you here last time your mistresss brother came over ? you know , just before he disappeared ?
mr de moraes is due back from brazil late this evening . mrs de moraes is out and not expected before eight . do you wish ...
when will they be back ?
im afraid they are out at the moment , sir .
could i speak to carlos or deborah ?
good afternoon . de moraess residence .
that would be mrs de moraes mother , sir . mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter .
de moraes ? i was asked here by a mrs spitz .
i am lawrence , sir . mr and mrs de moraes majordomo . they are expecting you .
that might depend on where youre going .
will you please come with me ?
thats right .
the dead can wait .
i ... we have to bury leon tommorrow ...
you wouldnt understand .
why the hell couldnt you divorce the man ?
your parents arranged the visit to my office ?
i dont know . everyones dead ...
what do you suggest ?
on ... once ... once ... what are we ... you going to do ?
so you did talk about it , huh ?
my parents flew back from israel ... told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce . he flew back to brazil ... and his drowning was arranged ...
get to the point , will you ...
the staff dont know yet ... i called my parents , told them everything ... i just couldnt take any more ...
your flunkey said he was expected back tonight .
they found his body yesterday . in the pool at our house in sao paulo . he drowned . drank too much , went for a swim and drowned .
no . not us ...
we ? you and your parents killed your husband ?
do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother ?
he ... he is dead ! my husband is dead ! call my parents . theyll tell you . call them !
do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser , deborah ? and then , your brothers not buried yet . as i said earlier , an autopsy will ...
what are you doing ? you cant . i ...
you know something ? ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time . id hoped to have a private word with adonis , but if thats the way you want it .
perhaps i did ... until fear turned into panic . thats when he hit me , and told me hed killed my brother ... you dont know what youve done , he said . were in deep trouble , he said . we , he said . we . wed both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us , he said . we had to stop you and friedman meeting ...
well , i hope you enjoyed yourself .
i didnt intend it that way ... it just happened . he heard from laurence that youd been back . that wed argued . he asked why and it just happened ; i told him everything ... i couldnt help it . wanted to see him scared . i had never seen him scared before , you see ...
to get me killed ... ?
my husband didnt need to slap me about , mr lombard . i volunteered ...
perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little .
you seem to know what youre talking about .
we all have to like what we become . cowards included . we achieve this by complicating things a little . but its never that complicated really .
should i ?
dont you believe in simplicity ?
simplify and damn .
where is that ?
here we go again .
what happened ? adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice ?
something like that .
something like that ?
something like that .
what was the idea ? husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed ?
i didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet , mr lombard !
a fright ? ... five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright ?
maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright .
and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman .
... were turning in circles .
are there truly no extenuating circumstances ?
you splendid bastard ...
five years of it . surely , youd have divorced him if he disgusted you ?
you bastard ...
rich . young . beautiful . you must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids .
why do i feel i neednt answer that ?
is there anything to understand ?
good .
i dont .
think what you like . but dont presume to understand .
one just doesnt ... tell me , what does one speak about , huh ?
i didnt know my husband and friedman knew each other . i just ... do you think we spoke about it ? ive known for five years . hes known ive known for five years ... but not once have we spoken about it . there are things one just doesnt speak about ...
why did you send me after friedman ? to atone for your sins ?
that my brother , my husband and your mr friedman were linked , that much i had guessed . but that my husband had killed leon ? no .
you dont say .
youre wrong about my being there , though . carlos borrowed my car that day , his had broken down ... leon saw it , like you , assumed i was there , thought hed wait to ask for a lift . but carlos turned up , with the tape you found ... leon got his lift , and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out . he watched it , confronted carlos , threatened to tell the police about the hotel ... i dont know how he knew about the hotel . perhaps carlos talked too much ... my husband did not tell me ... you more or less guessed the rest ... i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles .
oh no . at long last leon had found a mission . hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned . your husband killed your brother . and thanks to you , almost got me killed too .
leon could still have hung himself .
kids are not your thing , deborah . youd have been ready for me when i turned up with sleeping beauty . damn it ! then too i should have paid more attention . not leon , you said . it struck me at the time , but obviously not hard enough . you didnt say my god ! , or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved . not leon . who then ? you sure were right about one thing , deborah , the job was too formidable for me . i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles . but there i was focused so hard on friedman id stopped thinking . nothing added up - leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go ; infiltrating the world of child traffickers ; duping friedman into selling him a little boy ... you sure were right . the job was too formidable for me . but you knew that , didnt you ?
if-if my car is there , i could be the one who ... why dont you accuse me of killing my brother ?
your brother stumbled upon adoniss little secret , didnt he ? and traded his silence for a kid and some cash . and adonis fell for it , bought him his kid , sent him away , and then killed him when he came back for more . leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints . he came to extort a second kids life . your flunkey let him in , so his visit couldnt be concealed , hence the exhibition story . there was no exhibition . just as you suspected . remember , deborah ? leon does his own prints . wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art . i should have paid more attention to your words . perhaps its the way you say them ...
not in the strict sense of the word , no . he was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when i caught up with him later .
... you-you spoke to him ?
i doubt friedman ever even met leon , deborah . friedman dealt with select customers . as for my envelope , had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles .
leon didnt hang himself , deborah . your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide . how did he do it , eh ? strangulation ? drugs ? no doubt an autopsy will tell .
leon hung himself ...
leons not found , your parents worry , talk of hiring help to find him , even mention their manhunter friends perhaps ... and adonis panics , takes control , brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward , not before leons found anyhow . he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations .
leon hung himself ...
adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest , didnt he ? seemed like a good idea . an ex-junkie , obsessed with death ; the perfect candidate for suicide . he just forgot one thing : forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november . an englishman might have thought of that , but a brazilian ...
leon hung himself .
does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you ? hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband .
my brother hung himself .
what do you mean , no , mrs de moraes ?
no !
tell me , did he kill his little victims too ?
it must be tough being married to adonis to end up sleeping alone every night . sleep must be hard coming . whats harder ? the thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if ? or imagining what he does with his children ?
how ... when did you ...
i take it you learnt to live with yours then . take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being ...
huh ! dont you recall convincing me he had ? you should learn to live with your mistakes , mr lombard . there is some merit in it .
you knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance , didnt you ?
whatever the reason , im sorry i did . goodbye , mr lombard . i believe you know your way out .
i guess the news youd sent me after friedman didnt go down too well , eh ?
you do have a vivid imagination , mr lombard . i only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious . i fail to understand your purpose in this . still , say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out , all right ?
when did you learn about his taste for kids , huh ? on your honeymoon ? or was it later , when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother ? how did you find out ? did he confess ? try to convert you perhaps ? or was it womans intuition ? or just the way he fucked you ?
have you finished ?
you know hed have had him killed , dont you ? does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind , deborah ? or is it just cold expediency ? could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married ?
why ... i dont know what youre talking about .
ive had a long and unpleasant day . im tired and im angry . but mad ? not yet . i paid leons boy a visit this morning . found him alive and well . why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note , eh ?
youre mad ...
how did you break into my office , deborah ? ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips . come on , deborah ! acting dumb doesnt suit you ! who knew id found dirt on your brother , huh ? who knew it was in an envelope ? taking me for dead , whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands ?
you what , mrs de moraes ? you what ?
you ... you are out of order , mr lombard . i ...
or is it the other way round ? the children are needed because you cant satisfy him ?
whats in the bag ? underwear ? to seduce your husband ? or is it for your own recreation ? tell me , how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms ? is it because he does it with little children ?
sorry ?
black suits you .
i ... if you dont mind , i do not think he matters now . it ... things turned out to be as we thought ; leon was weak . theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore . now , will you please tell me how much we owe you ?
arent you curious to know about friedman ?
i ... well , were burying leon tomorrow and ... look , i wish i had more time , but its late and with the funeral ...
youre repeating yourself , mrs de moraes .
im really sorry you were not called ...
why dont you ask when i left the mondrian ?
when did you get back ?
how are you , mrs de moraes ?
mr lombard ...
uh ... wait a moment , mrs de moraes ...
mr lombard . mrs de moraes ...
yeah . goodnight , mrs de moraes .
paul lamont ... ?
not yet . the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address . ill give it 24 hours . he just might show up . if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont . paul lamont , all right ?
yes ... you woke me up ... its the middle of the night here . have you found mr friedman ?
are you all right ?
... 7548. have you ... have you found him yet ?
the mondrian , room 504. the number is 266 7548 , plus the l.a. code ...
just a moment ... go ahead .
have you got a pen ?
mr lombard ?
you do want me to keep the job , dont you , mrs de moraes ?
you drive a hard bargain , mr lombard .
w-why are you telling me all this , mr lombard ?
minimizes the risks . children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses . these can also be used to move women and drugs ... anything that makes money really .
the hotels are useful capital investments . the kids liquid assets . my guess is they own hotels across the globe , and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot .
huh ! really ? hotels ?
you watched the tape ? friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes , mrs de moraes . theyre in the import-export business . they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise .
are we understood ?
well , i found a little more than that . let me put it this way : ... last night i thought your brother might be dead , tonight im convinced he is . that said , i have no evidence and i advise you to let the police deal with it .
im impressed . that information could have cost me 20,000 .
the man who sold the boy to your brother .
who is friedman ?
you could say that . and friedman left this morning for los angeles .
you lost my money ?
last night you upset my sleep . tonight my social life . we have two minutes . my dinner guests are waiting .
thank you for coming . come in and close the door , will you ?
you drive a hard bargain .
i still dont buy your story but i figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry . besides , if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner , we could always get the right people onto you . i trust you know who i am talking about .
couldnt nazi hunters do the job ?
huh ! who do you think we are , mr lombard ?
why me , mrs de moraes ? why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time french detective to look for their missing son , mrs de moraes ?
the family hired you and i have just fired you , mr lombard .
i was hired by your parents , mrs de moraes .
laurence !
no . youre fired ! get out of my house . and take your sick tape with you ...
perhaps i should come back when youre ...
get out of my house . youre fired , mr lombard .
excuse me ?
no . the question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here , mr lombard .
the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything , mrs de moraes .
how dare you ... you dont know this tape belongs to my brother , do you , mr lombard ?
look , mrs de moraes , however much of a let down it might be , your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks ! impressionable as he is , he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses , tried moving on to bigger things , came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world . which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table ... have a look at it , mrs de moraes . i told you i had bad news ...
oh no . youll have to do better than that , mr lombard .
i cant tell you that yet . but hes being well looked after .
where is it ? he . the boy you said my brother bought ! where is he ?
i will of course do my best to hang onto it .
i need the money to smooth my way , you understand ? now , have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning ?
excuse me ?
your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place , mrs de moraes . and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise . you dont mess around with child procurers . right now my guess is hes either on the run , held captive , or dead . i understand your misgivings , mrs de moraes . but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from . if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man . which leads me to why im here at such a late hour . i need 20,000 , in cash , by 11 this morning .
what ... what are you talking about ?
you seem surprised . could it be you dont think that badly of him after all ? you neednt worry . it seems his motives were pure . from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse .
theres more . your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000 .
you ... you found that at leons ?
its a snuff movie . prime paedophile material . im told it retails at around 4,000. i see you dont require a definition .
disney ! how inter ...
i found this at your brothers .
anything is possible .
can it be that you want your brother found ?
can it be that easy ?
now you are confusing me , mrs de moraes .
oh-oh ! touch , mr lombard ! but tell me , what would you know about sisterly love , eh ? no . dont . you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed , at least until youve done what we are paying you for .
i dont know . he seems to delight in so much sisterly love , he might become determined .
for your information , mr lombard , trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself . though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that .
im afraid i have bad news , mr de moraes . i have reason to believe your brothers in trouble .
i wont comment on the time but youll understand if i dont tell you to sit down . now , spare me the apology and get to the point , will you , mr lombard .
was it cash , mr de moraes ? the 1,000. you gave it to him in cash ?
perhaps it wasnt so brave of him . had i been here i just might have given him his money , mr lombard . one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct , as someone in your line of work ought to know .
is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan ?
i have too much money to work , mr lombard .
what about you , mrs de moraes ?
well , leon does not need money for prints , mr lombard . does his own printing . wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art ! which , as he subsequently vanished , raises the question : what was the money for ? perish the thought .
and that is the last time any ...
three weeks ago . to borrow money . i wasnt here but he got to my husband , sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made . carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him .
that depends what youre looking at .
appearances can be deceptive , mrs de moraes .
now you know why youre here , mr lombard . it might be difficult for someone like you to discern , but we are people of a certain standing .
can you tell me how you spell ...
penrhyndeudraeth , north wales .
a call box ? thats odd . where exactly ?
theres nothing wrong with the line , sir . are you sure you have the right number ? 770 471 is the number of a call box .
01766 770 471. let me check it for you , sir .
yes . im trying to reach a friend but i cant get through . the number is 01766 770 471 .
directory enquiries . can i help you ?
not in america , sir . you must be from europe . so , black coffee and a couple of crescents .
the word for those things is croissants .
croissants . like that ...
im sorry , sir . could you try that again ?
croissants .
crow what ?
a coffee and a couple of croissants .
good morning , sir . how can i help you ?
huh ! and they say charitys only rewarded in heaven ... hallelujah ... christ ...
nothing sticks to slime , emily . this should cover what you lent me .
i can ... the question is , can you lie to your ex- husband ?
you can not walk away from this . you can not .
theyd never let me go . and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me .
my ex-husband . my work drove him away . made his life a misery . he thinks im obsessed , punishing myself for what happened to our son . but hes a good guy . hell listen to you . he wont turn you in if i ask him not to . i can pretty much guarantee that . okay ?
what about your friendly cop ?
... im emily stewart . the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared . the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat . however i go about this thats who i am . do you get what im fucking saying , mr lombard ?
its up to you whether they walk or not .
damn it ! you cant fucking walk away from this !
look ! either you talk or the creeps are gon na walk . for gods sake . what am i supposed to say ? i got this from a french guy from england who broke in there to have a chat with an austrian child trafficker ? is that it ?
then find another way .
a seminar in a baby breeding farm ! bodies in acid ! you think ill get anywhere with that ? jesus ! with luck i might raise a laugh . they might even send a patrol car to check the place out . whatever , itll be too late .
im finished here and im tired , emily . you shouldnt be here . now dont make it worse .
that-that wont do . thats not the way it goes . you saw it , you tell it , thats the way ...
call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid . can i have the keys to your house ?
do you know a friendly cop ?
were both thinking the same thing , right ?
no one saw me but the italian and a dog . i blew up their generator . they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing . it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up ...
who knows . who cares ... you wanted slime . you got slime .
italian ? the mafia ... ?
some italian i picked up back there . hes in the boot of the mustang .
so who ... whos the man ? where is he ?
friedmans dead ... they killed him ...
what ... some kind of organ factory ... pregnant girls doped up . babies . theres a lot of people back there . theyre holding a seminar . traffickings the past , breeding the future ...
what ... ?
whos the guy ? whos the guy ! nom de dieu ! had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate id have had to kill him .
look , you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep ! what happened ? whos the guy ? the austrian ?
i think so . and if it comes to it , tell the cops anything you think will make them move . whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is . bye now .
have you found your man ? is that where he is ?
route 395. past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel . theres a dirt track with a closed to the public sign . it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere . if you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry , okay ? but not before , you hear ?
oh . what ... yeah . okay .
get a pen and dont ask any questions .
burn the passport and keep the money . think of it as a donation to the cause ...
what am i to do with the packages if ...
dont fall asleep with your hair wet .
yeah . goodnight , emily .
right ... well , ill get your money first thing in the morning , okay ? okay . goodnight then .
thank you . but i think ill go to bed . its been a long day .
a little too tight , eh ? ... they were my sons . only thirteen and already six feet tall . a real lanky boy ... i ... theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry .
come on , mr lombard . you tailed your man all the way here from europe . you told me you knew where to find him , remember ? or didnt i hear you right ?
huh ... i have no ... ... hard evidence ...
did you not enter this country illegally ?
a criminal ?
its give and take time , mr lombard . you need help , we need information . you didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it , did you ?
did you call me up here to enjoy yourself , emily , or to let me use your phone ? because we seem to have a slight problem ...
how come youre alive ? child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do . what am i really looking at here , huh ? are you really not just a lousy private eye ? am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise ?
thank you for the guided tour , but would you mind telling me what were doing here ?
like youll find a way to stop your austrian killing you a second time round ?
im sure ill find a way .
no answer . you have no passport and your embassys out . how do you plan to leave the u.s. , mr lombard ?
hah ... what about nathalie ?
a recent acquisition . weve had four break- ins this year alone ; files stolen , computers wrecked , faeces smeared on walls . the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders ; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us . an easy living indeed , mr lombard . i got through to moreau and jane . i left your landlord out of it . your flats been broken into . jane wants you to call her back .
i wouldnt mind . thank you .
thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery . but still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation . officially , its just not called for . sit down . can i offer you some coffee ?
i might come back , i might not . but if i do , it wont be for a couple of hours .
i know where to look .
you know where to look for your austrian , right ?
i thought youd never ask ... as i was having my coffee and crescents at the mondrian the other morning i spotted your photograph in the los angeles times ... theres a tough lady , i thought . just the kind who might help me ...
there are over 4 million people in this city - why me ?
lombard ... it will take a few days for the things i need to get here . meanwhile id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog ...
have you never heard of collect calls , mr ...
no . a poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer . he disappeared on his second shopping expedition .
you dont know why hes come to los angeles ? the man you say he killed ? who was he ? a colleague of his ?
yeah .
by your austrian ?
the mondrian , room 504. i was checked out in my absence .
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there ?
french people need a visa to enter this country . that takes time and i didnt have any . i used a british passport . my names not lamont but lombard . xavier lombard .
okay . the woman just cant walk away ... i want straight answers . no hesitation or i walk for sure . why cant you go to your embassy ?
you ... jesus christ !
well , id sooner mug an old lady ...
i cant believe this ... whats coming now , eh ? if i dont pay all hells gon na break loose , is that it ?
a small loan would be welcome . more urgently , i need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me .
is this some kind of sick stunt ? let me guess . you want money , right ?
im fine standing , thank you .
youre sure you wont sit down , miss stewart ?
i dont smoke . if you could get to the point ...
you wouldnt have a cigarette , would you ?
youre a long way from home ...
europe ... france . im french but i live in london ... ... england .
may i ask where youre from , mr lamont ?
shell be alright . shes tough ...
shit ! fuck ! whats fucking wrong with people ! im going to bed . and sweet dreams to you to !
no . youre looking at a real musketeer here , whitney . brave and rash . had to dash in there . take a prisoner ... might as well have sent them a notice to quit ... come on , musketeer ! got anything to say ?
emily ...
look at him , whitney . come all the way from england to clean up california . huh !
thats right . wheres the fucking italian , eh , mr french hero ?
weve still got the italian ...
most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes , mr lombard - confused and frightened victims . its all too easily discredited , you understand . now , you might be just what weve been waiting for . your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen .
if you have hard evidence about a child trafficker , we want it , mr lombard . and we want it before you get yourself killed ...
hi ...
and losing you , wed lose him . and that would be a shame , dont you agree ?
whitney armstrong , my deputy . what whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your austrian ...
have the money ready by 11am . well call you .
... fine . ill go for the safe place .
fifteen for a straight delivery . twenty with the provision of a safe place . visitors tend to find the second option more convenient .
i see . how much ?
im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained . but they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases ...
tomorrow ?
how much of a hurry are you in ?
what about an untrained pup , white ...
so , what are you looking for ?
yes ... good , good ...
we also provide 24-hour after-sale service . were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die , we would unburden you , you understand ?
yeah .
pups . bitches . from three to twelve months . trained and untrained ones . white and brown ones . you understand ?
what sort have you got ?
what sort of puppy are you looking for ?
this is a bad line .
why ?
may i have your phone number ?
i saw the ad at georges . im passing through town and im in a hurry .
have we done business before ?
im calling about the puppies .
downstairs ... at the front ... jesus ...
where is it ?
b-black ...
what colour is your car ? what colour is your car ?
f-five . the wilsons and their three kids . they run the place . look , man , ive got to get to ...
what about the staff ? theyre in on whats going on , arent they ? how many of them ?
another hotel . down the road . martin lives there . he took your money . hes got a safe ... i need a doctor ...
whats the ambassador ?
just me ... martins gone back to the ambassador . look ...
how many of you scumbags are here ?
i dont know . i dont know , man . i dont even know friedman that well ... i ... man , youve got to get me out of here ...
what company ?
the company . we all work for the company .
and who does friedman work for ?
i dont know ... this is just a delivery place , man ! i swear i dont know where the kids are ... i work for martin , thats all . martin knows . he works for friedman . he knows ...

can i have the reception desk , please .
the hyatt . good afternoon . may i help you ?
ill call again .
im sorry but mr gluck is not answering , sir . would you like to leave a message ?
thank you , jane .
yes . how did ...
carlos de moraes ?
really ? and how are you , eh ? someone called pierre dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a brazilian friend of ...
hello , jane . its me .
what are you up to , eh , savieer ? i mean , not this but ... money , passports , a gun in a microwave ? who are you , eh ? who are you ?
id appreciate it if you could do this for me . if you cant , dont worry about it . ill call in about an hour anyway . sorry but im in a hurry .
your secretary , huh !
just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past . say youre my secretary , all right ?
thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money , all right ? ... come on , i need you . its important .
piss off !
well , im sorry . i ... this is my nephew ... and my brother , tim . ive got the week off and hes come to stay .
its not .
no ... i told you on the phone . whoever broke in messed-up all your papers . i put everything back where i thought it ought to be . maybe its there with ...
jane , there was an envelope in my desk . the one id given you and then got back , remember ? i cant find it . do you know where it is ?
hello there . hows the flat . i cleaned ...
oui , bonjour , jean ... oui , trs bien , merci . dites-moi , pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment ... vous tes certain ... non , non ... je vous remercie ...
i came to feed your fish . i didnt know ...
bye bye , jane . and dont be naughty .
shes pretty ... see you , huh ?
oh yeah ! better be good and hurry away then ! who knows ? we might be being watched ! maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all , thats what they do to their employees , isnt it ? huh ! hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives . thanks for the lift !
ive got work tonight , jane .
oh no . im all right . he was a jerk , really . another boy , you know ? all i meet is boys . when i think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls . i mean , is it true ?
well , i hope youre not too heartbroken and ...
oh ... we split up .
its friday night , jane . what happened to your latest boyfriend ?
so you havent seen the film , then ?
that are called rommel or something , i guess not that many .
i dont know . how many famous french film directors can there be ?
should i ?
la collectionoose . its about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her . its on tv tonight and as im in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and ... the review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct . and witty . the directors supposed to be famous . rommel or something . french . you must know him ?
la what ?
have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose ?
yes . but my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company . for expenses and all that , you know ? itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it . of course , youd need a partner to register . but thats a formality . i mean , i could be your partner . i mean , just as a name , right ?
good .
must be your lucky day then . ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year .
no .
fine . how was the match ? did you loose ?
how are you , jane ?
hello again , neighbour . i didnt intrude , did i ?
jah ...
look at it this way . he might achieve everything your son never did .
plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education .
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy ?
fine . one more thing , mrs and mr spitz ; may i ask what is or was your occupation ?
my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel . deborah will be here if you need anything before our return .
ha ... no , mr lombard . his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us . he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate .
why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography , mrs spitz ?
we are aware of your rates , mr lombard . we will pay you double your rates plus expenses . in return , need i say it again , we expect discretion and undivided attention .
my rates ...
the 1,000 is on account .
when ... im told he came here ...
im sure ... as far as you know , when and where was your son last seen ?
the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about . his address is in this envelope with leonards address , keys and other things you might need .
any friends ?
no . and before you ask , no , hes not gay ! he has had girlfriends , but nothing serious ...
i take it your son is not married , mrs spitz ?
then why arent you asking the police to look for your son , mrs spitz ?
he could indeed , mr lombard . but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it .
so he could have decided to go on a trip ...
leonard does not hold a driving licence . as for his passport , i do not know where he keeps it .
did you look for his passport , driving licence ?
yesterday . it all looked normal .
i presume you checked your sons apartment ...
then you should not have sought an explanation .
i didnt mean to imply you did , mrs spitz .
i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography , mr lombard . by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold . so as you see , i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account .
check with your sons bank . banks dont usually give out information about their customers .
do what , mr lombard ?
how did you do that , mrs spitz ?
you wouldnt be here if i knew , mr lombard . what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks . that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results . and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now .
what do you think has happened to your son , mrs spitz ?
leonard . what my daughter is on about , mr lombard , is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian . you might as well know that ...
i take it your son is called leon ?
what i can appreciate is insolence , mr lombard !
look mrs spitz ... i dont know to whom im indebted for the recommendation but ... im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references . what i do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not i can be of help . i hope you can appreciate that , mrs spitz .
good . now , as i trust you may have guessed , we are looking for someone to work for us . someone whose discretion can be relied upon . someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment . do you think you could be that person , mr lombard ?
okay . recommended ...
you may not . and besides , it is irrelevant .
didnt you say i came recommended ? thats what i thought . may i know by whom ?
must i speak to you in french ?
recommended ?
whatever , you come recommended . we ...
well , i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning , mrs spitz . i wouldnt like to think id kept you waiting for nothing .
what if it is ?
i hope its not too significant .
lombard , this is not a jewish name , is it ?
may i ask if you are jewish , mr lombard ?
may i ... ?
spitz . we spoke on the telephone . my husband ... my daughter , deborah , whose house this is . my son-in-law , carlos ... the gentleman is a business partner of his .
good afternoon , mrs ... ?
ho-hotel ... los angeles ... he ...
the hyatt ... ? whats that ?
hyatt ... friedmans ... at the hyatt ...
trying to say something , martin ?
dying without ever reaching the top ...
what is ?
i told you ... the rabble , its me ... huh ... its sad .
you seem very sure about that .
youre making a mistake , tough guy . whoever he is , your guys not one of friedmans ...
is this friedman , martin ? come on , scumbag . youve reached your sell- by date . tell me if this is friedman , where he is in los angeles and what name hes using ?
who are you ? who are you working for , huh ?
is this friedman ?
could someone have hurt you that bad ?
huh ... im sure thered be lots of takers .
you know what , martin ? i ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world . free . and hope you never die .
boys like the one you met today are surplus . commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into . we improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted , improve still more selling them where they are . is that too hard for you ?
im overcome by your public-spiritedness .
maybe you should . think about it . those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone . those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines .
maybe i dont .
money talks , bullshit walks , whether you like it or not .
only feeding the disease , eh , martin ?
huh . id have thought a tough guy like you would know better . the sick ones are out there , friend . they make up the clientle . get rid of them and were out of business .
is it real ? you people are sick .
maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me . come on , lets go ...
youre out of your mind . whats the idea ?
shut up and drive !
this car needs petrol .
dont jump any red lights .
no . in hampstead ... why ?
friedman lives with you at the ambassador ?
look , i dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here , mister . whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you . why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner , eh ?
where is friedman ?
huh , i doubt it ... friedman only deals directly with select customers . i handle the rabble ...
this one came back and was never seen again . i understand friedman looked after him .
clients come and go .
six weeks ago . he bought a boy of yours .
am i supposed to know him ?
right now your big friend at the diplomat is bleeding fast , martin . he might still possibly survive if attended to soon . and he did cooperate .
i dont know what your problem is , but ...
lets go .
uh-huh . you couldve waited for me inside .
is my money in there ?
problems ?
does it matter ?
vous tes franais ?
anything at all . i presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished ? theres a 500 fee for disposal . the boy is yours , you understand ?
anything at all ?
the rooms yours for 24 hours . its sound- proofed , stocked up with food , drink and other things you might find useful . you can do anything you like .
we conclude our transaction .
what happens now ?
we need a double-room and as i understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room ...
what are you talking about ?
this is the hotel supervisor , mr lamont . im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve .
what is it ?
le mercury . newman street . ask for peter .
three oclock .
at what time will you be available ?
yeah .
its about the puppy . you got the money ?
you must agree to be blindfolded ... just for the journey . it might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement .
ill be alone .
will you be alone ? the merchandise . is it just you or ...
questions can amount to revelations . now , id hate to think i was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination . mr friedman led me to believe we had a deal . do we ?
an austrian ... not much to go on , is it ?
an austrian .
and while visiting our fair city you ... an austrian ?
the ladys not a friend . shes a whore . someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london . and not just movies .
your lady friend did .
i dont recollect mentioning a friend .
the person who put us in touch seems to think so .
have you ?
i gather weve done business with a friend of yours ?
should i come back in five minutes ?
five to three . youre early .
yes . you wouldnt know where i could reach him ? we had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my paris gallery , you see ? i really need to see him before i leave .
im sorry ...
oh . this is ... wed arranged to meet tonight and im due to return to paris tomorrow ...
no . i meant he left as in no longer works here .
left ? when ? i just come from his place and there was no one there . a neighbour of his ...
leon ? no . im afraid he left .
no . thank you . could you tell me if leon spitz is here , please ?
evening . table for one ?
good . you neednt worry about the austrian anymore . hes dead . ill be in touch .
fine ...
hows the boy doing ?
he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street ...
... no . in fact , id seen him a couple of months earlier . he was quite depressed . his work wasnt getting anywhere . he said he was going to try something new , realism , london in the nineties - documentary stuff , you know ...
you sure ? what about before he turned up with the boy ?
... no .
did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work ?
yes . three thousand pounds . i still ...
the money leon left for the boy , was it cash ?
he ... apparently the hostility was all hers . leon didnt ... it hurt him . they used to be close ... their parents were in their forties when they were born , you see . and mostly away . they grew up in a scottish mansion with old nannies and servants . he ... our world was so old and cold , we shone for one another , leon used to say . his sister cut him off after she got married . he never understood why but thought it was because she had no children . was bitter ...
did he ever refer to the hostility between them ?
er ... yes ...
ive been away . did leon speak to you about his sister ?
the nineteenth ... how come you didnt know ?
whats the date ?
hed come prepared . he had something besides shiva ... sleeping beauty . the disney film ... well , it looked like the disney film . it was something else . i couldnt watch ...
no sick people in the country , huh ? ... just tell me one thing , rhian . leons story about the boy ? you just took his word for it ?
im sorry . its just you dont look local ...
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun . if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did .
oh , i ... she just moved . ive got her new ... its in my book in the kitchen . wait ... thank you .
i cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway . my number if anything happens . whats your sisters number ?
yes ... you-youre not going to take shiva away ?
is she on the phone ?
my sister ... she lives in the next valley .
who else knows about the boy ?
albert ... albert and ethel . why ?
do you know leons parents names ?
theyre german jews . came here before the war . they both lost all their families in extermination camps , but they themselves never went near one . the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon . its not guilt , more of a curse ... and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters ... but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions ...
im afraid i dont understand .
yeah ... but he didnt beat the demons ... a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire . all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims .
his mother would be pleased to hear that .
thats what he said . i tried to dissuade him ... told him i couldnt take on another child , that hed get into trouble ... i mean , people who sell children ... but he wasnt listening ... i guess he finally found himself a crusade ... his family think hes back on drugs , eh ? huh ... leon did drugs . a lot of drugs . went through his self-destruct phase , you know ? things to come to terms with . demons to fight ... some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated . not leons . he did beat the drug , though . he did .
good reasons ?
he just said he had good reasons .
did leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved , rhian ?
we didnt quite make it as lovers ... leon is a good man , though ...
shut up !
what are you going to do now ? call the police ? take him away ? i must warn you hes terrified of men , so ...
you-youre wrong . i just called to ask if i could stay with him next time im in london . thats all .
havent you ? then why the worried messages on his answering machine , rhian ? id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble .
you thought wrong . i havent seen leon for months .
well , i obviously do . and i also know that leons not here , rhian . but i thought that you might know where i should look for him .
... leons not here . how did you get here ? phil doesnt know where i live .
as you know from speaking to phil , your friend leon has disappeared , rhian . his family have hired me to find him .
no ! what do you want here ? how do you know me ?
can i get up now ?
whats a french private investigator doing here ?
should i be ?
a private investigator ... youre not austrian ?
reach for it and throw it to me . and ... my fingers on the trigger , you hear !
in my jacket . left inside pocket .
shut up ! wheres your wallet ?
is this some kind of mugging ? because ...
wheres your wallet ? have you got a wallet ?
its wet . will this do ?
how are you , rhian ?
this is private property . the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge .
is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists ? you go to your world , ill stay in mine . so long , mister .
huh ... i suppose the idea of a one day trip to los angeles doesnt appeal to you ...
barstows 30 miles to the left . los angeles a hundred to the right . wherever youre heading , i reckon somebodyll pick you up .
im sure you would . but if i had one , i wouldnt let you near it . now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise . and for what its worth , i wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality . id sooner shoot you than have you upset me ...
id appreciate it if i could use your phone .
los angeles is 100 miles away .
los angeles ?
huh ... i guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet ... ill give you one more day , a meal , and then youre on your way .
three days and thats three days too many.come on . get your ass up .
i ... how long have i been here ?
now , can you stand up ? can you use your legs and stand up ?
i didnt think so . the rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with ... i dont wan na know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in owl canyon . but you might as well know id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this ...
no ...
and you aint neither one of those damned mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides , are you , mister ?
fucked-up fucking weird .
yeah . why ? youre going to look for her ... shit ! you really think his pictures are that good ?
could that be camden market ?
yeah ! somewhere in wales . i dont really know her . used to turn up in a transit van on weekends , sell old furniture at camden . thats how come he only laid her at weekends , ha ha ...
would you know where i might reach her ?
oh . thatd be rhian , a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends . she got wise and dumped him months ago ...
small , blond , good-looking . she was with him when we met . she had a funny english accent .
what about which girlfriend ?
what about his girlfriend ?
let me put it this way then ; the photographs and the man ? one and the same , man , one and the same . at best fucking weird , at worst fucked-up fucking weird . maybe you should think yourself lucky . some folks just aint worth getting involved with . and leon sure is one of em .
i know his work better than i know him .
huh ! you could always try suicide bridge . you dont know leon , do you ?
i take it you dont know where he is , then ?
no shit ... well , im afraid i cant help you .
uh-huh .
i hear youre looking for leon . that makes me , his old-lady , and now you , looking for the little bastard . leons gone , man . vanished . you interested in his photographs ?
excuse me ?
welcome to the club .
if you can , send me a receipt .
we are so alike , xavier . still , sometimes i wonder which one of us is the ugliest .
i dont have your credentials , nathalie .
then why dont you reach him ?
but maybe you know someone who does . an austrian , in london , dealing in kids and snuff videos . how many can there be ? these people supply to order . he has to be known , reachable .
a lachat , trois ou quatre mille . en location , cinq cent . mais a pourrait faire plus . je ne sais pas . cest pas vraiment mon truc . i dont know any austrian , xavier .
le montage , lemballage . not your regular street muck , is it ? this is collectors stuff . how much would it cost me ?
alors quoi ?
alors ?
eh bien ... tes sr que tas besoin de moi ? la petite ma lair assez bien foutue , non ?
mon bureau cotait trop cher .
o est pass ton salon ?
bye . and thanks ... nathalie gently closes the door , eyes lombard who shakes himself awake ... rolls her eyes and surveys the room ...
tu sais o me trouver .
jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre . pas avant la matine .
viens .
cinq cents .
whats an hour of your time worth these days , nathalie ? combien , nathalie !
un autrichien . negociant en pr- pubescents .
quest-ce que tu veux ?
huh . im a businessman . what are you , eh ?
dont tempt me . the last scumbag who thought i might kill him died soon afterwards .
what you gon na do ? kill me ?
shut up and walk ...
when they realise im missing ...
thats what he said ...
youre sure he said his caller was a man ?
two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the london hotels . he didnt need your confession ...
what sums ?
some guy called to let him know the frenchman whod called the night before he left london was in l.a. looking to kill him . he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously .
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call .
i can only tell you what he told us ...
try again , and this time be polite .
thats the beauty . an anonymous call . makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to , eh , french-fuck ?
so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room ... how did friedman say he got to know where to find me ?
huh . maybe he figured the news our london bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well . he only shared his guilty secret last night . and then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk .
i think youd rather not know what i think .
what do you think , huh ?
so why didnt he ?
if he had , youd be dead .
are you telling me friedman didnt tell you i was here looking for him ?
thats just it . the sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues ... testa di cazzo ! hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you ... he hasnt gone to hell too soon ... and neither will you , mr lamont !
nice way to help a colleague in trouble .
huh ! you turned him into a liability , didnt you know ?
why did you kill him ?
let me give you a tip , asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in london and here tonight and hopes to get away with it . it upsets people . its wrong . fucking wrong .
why did you kill friedman ?
huh ! youve been around , eh ?
the acid bath ?
youre the lantern man , huh ? if you wan na see whats left of him ...
glucks dead , you sonofabitch !
three ...
fuck ...
five seconds . then you die .
figlio di puttana . youre the french asshole who bumped off the london guys ...
gluck .
who ? i dont know who the fuck youre talking about , sunshine .
okay , shitbag . im only going to ask you this once . where is friedman ?
its a good guess ...
mossad ?
their last suspected kill occurred two years back , though your spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group . still , id watch my step . these people are well-connected , laurent ; former israeli prime minister , etc . the ladys also president of an international zionist organisation ... anyway , you get the picture .
are they still operative ?
it appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady german group of nazi hunters known as never forget . over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings .
they lost their son . why ?
salut , laurent . ouais . it wasnt easy but i got what you wanted through interpol . say , whats your business with these spitzes ?
moreau ? cest moi . alors ...
sure . but speak english , will ya , ha ha ...
very funny . can i go on now ?
i dont know . could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor , huh ?
what do you think ?
whats that ? a word ?
costliest !
cost what ?
ha ha ... yes . with prices reaching an all time low , the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at ... as we all know , transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business ...
tremoille ... do n't . please ...
what do you fear most now ... my sword ? ... or his hands ?
no . i see the hand of tremoille , and regnault , and yolande , and you ... and they are dirty hands .
jean ... me dear , loyal jean ... why do you want to oppose the will of god ? jeanne wanted to go to compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught . then , on my personal orders , regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom , and once again the answer was no . and now you say she tried to escape , and the answer is still no . jean , open your eyes -- ca n't you see the hand of god in all this ?
but not impossible ... gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her ...
jean , it 's ... it 's not so easy ...
we have to do something before she tries it again ! i beg of you , my lord , do n't let her down ... let me organize an escape ...
it 's a miracle she 's not dead !
jeanne 's been badly injured ! she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat !
my dear aulon ... that 's fine ...
10,000 gold crowns .
very generous of you all . how much ?
here ... to help pay jeanne 's ransom . all the captains gave what they could , as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved ...
yes , my lord .
jeanne , this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer , jean d'aulon . jean ... i place her in your care . find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle ... and guard her with your life .
so ... pretend it 's not a game .
sire , you know how bad i am at this sort of game .
good . until then , feel free to live like a king !
of course i am , it 's just that ...
why , are you not ready to die for your king ?
majesty , i ca n't ...
my dear aulon , to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood !
my lord , i 'm not sure that ...
why not you -- jean d'aulon ? the only man who 's poorer than i am , and so the only man i can trust . dignified , honorable , wise ... what more could we ask of a king ?
... if she can find me ? -- that 's a brilliant idea ! if she 's really been sent by god she 'll discover the trap , and if she 's an assassin she 'll kill the wrong man ! bring her up !
let someone else pretend to be you , and see if ...
what do you mean ?
that 's a good idea , sire .
oh dear , why is life so complicated ? sometimes i really wish i could be someone else .
jeanne , you ca n't leave us like this !
i 'm not afraid of the fire anymore . it will purify me ...
no , you must come , jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left ... i have a new horse now , a white one , just like yours ... and la hire hardly swears at all anymore ... you ca n't stay -- they 'll burn you !
i 'm staying , jean .
... and maybe the king will give you some money , and a little land , and a title even ... ... would n't that be a fine thing ? you , a lady of title !
you do n't know what you 're saying . you 're going to leave this place , jeanne -- you 're going home -- or whatever you want -- you 're going to be happy , and have children , and ...
one day you will .
i -- i do n't understand ...
my gentle captain ... i 'm staying .
yes yes ... any moment ... you 're always so impatient ...
i 'm already free ...
just give me a moment and then you 'll be free ...
i am ready now ...
that 's an order !
i want to stay with you ...
do as i say !
but ... why ... what 's the point ?
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side !
not yet !
we must sound the retreat !
it would not be the same without you .
will you at least let me stay with you ?
if god wants me to win , he will find a way . and if he wants me to die ... if he wants me back ... then that 's fine too . then i 'll be with him forever .
to be killed in battle ?
but it is what i want .
but ... you 've done so much for god as it is ... ca n't you do something for yourself for once -- for jeanne ?
i would like to marry you . but i have already promised myself ... to god .
jeanne ... i believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once ? do n't go ... even if you do n't want to marry me .
jeanne ... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me , those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne !
i will ask my voices ... if they come back one day . meanwhile ... i 'm going to compiegne .
to marry you .
did you come back to marry me or to insult me ?
or maybe it 's jeanne who 's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she ca n't stop ?
no , but ...
did your voices tell you that ? you told me you had n't heard them for months ...
it 's a trap ! they 're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england !
he said that ... he 's making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and ...
what did the king say ?
you listen to your voices , i listen to my heart .
that 's not what i asked ... why do you want to marry me ?
tell the king to give me more men .
tell me ...
if you really want to help me , there 's one thing you can do .
jeanne ... i believe in you ... more than anyone ...
so ... even you do n't believe in me anymore ...
me ? ! it 's not me , it 's god who makes everything complicated ! if he 's all-powerful , why not let the english stay on their island in the first place ? and why let this war go on for a hundred years ? and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family ? why , why ? !
the truth is always simple ... it 's you , jean , who 's making things complicated .
you make it sound so simple ...
i do n't know it . i feel it .
but how do you know what you hear is the truth ?
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen .
but i hear so many voices ... one voice saying one thing , another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy , kill your enemy -- what is good , what is evil ... ?
well of course they 're me ! that 's how god talks to me . if you listen hard enough , even you can hear him . everyone can hear him .
but how do you know that these -- these voices are n't really just -- well , you .
it 's not time yet . my mission is not over yet . there is still more i must do before i can really -- finally -- go home .
maybe their silence is a sign ... ? maybe it 's a sign to go home ?
it 's been weeks since they spoke to me . since the coronation ... no signs ... nothing ...
what ... what do you mean ?
they 've abandoned me ... like everyone .
so ... what am i supposed to do now ?
jeanne ... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore .
because there 's an arrow in your leg .
yes . yes , i 'm fine ... we need more brushwood ! why are you staring at me like that ?
jeanne ... ! are you alright ?
jeanne , no ...
i 'll go .
it 's over , jeanne . we won , just as you said !
yes ...
jeanne , calm down , do you hear me ? are you alright ?
come with me ...
well ...
the king said you 're his finest archer ... ?
i promise ...
alright ... i promise to rest if you promise ... to go back to the battle .
no , it 's ... it 's nothing , it 's ...
jeanne , you 've been badly wounded ...
not so ... easily . why are n't you ... fighting ... ? go on ... we 're almost there ...
they 've started the battle without me !
what 's going on ? !
but ... to be honest ... i do n't think they 'll leave tomorrow .
good .
uh ... they said ... they will think about it .
what did they say ?
alright , whatever -- but since he 's not going to come down and cut it himself , at least let someone cut it properly !
how dare you tell me what god tells me to do !
he did n't tell you to cut all your hair off ... !
how dare you stop me doing god 's will !
jeanne , stop it !
there 's nothing to hear -- i have n't done anything . and why have n't i done anything ? because none of you will listen to me ! !
jeanne , calm down . you ca n't blame the people -- they 've been hearing all about you for weeks .
who do they think i am ? !
the king of england . i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there .
yes , i am . i 'm an archer who can read and write . who do you want to write to ?
i thought you were an archer ?
this i can do . i was studying at the university of paris -- till the english invaded it .
i also need someone who can read and write .
well ... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what i can do .
better today than tomorrow .
now ?
i shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner .
right . raymond ... a priest .
yes . i did n't confess today .
now ?
and i would like to see a priest .
louis ... water and fresh straw !
i would like some fresh straw .
do you think i could have some water ?
listen , please accept my apologies for ... you know , me pretending to be the ... well it was n't really my idea ... well , yes it was my idea but ...
i 'm fed up with taking her orders . she swore she 'd defeat the english before nightfall , instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed ! look at the mess we 're in ! that 's her mess , not mine ... ! we 're worse off then if she 'd never come at all ! ... now do as i say and sound the retreat !
but that was her order !
i made no such promise . sound the retreat for the night !
but i promised jeanne we 'd fight on !
sound the retreat ...
we have to press home the attack !
good .
jeanne 's alive !
no , i ... i never killed anyone !
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield , with your sword in your hand , waving it above your head ... charging against the enemy , screaming and yelling ... fighting for your life ... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone ?
yes , maybe ... i do n't remember ...
you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air ? like this ?
no , i ... i held it up to ...
did you use the sword that you held in your hand ?
yes , but ...
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword ?
yes , probably ... maybe ...
we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner ...
no ! i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them ... why did n't they listen to me ?
then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger ... too strong perhaps ... ?
no , of course not ... i never killed anyone ...
are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you 'd have killed more people ?
to avoid killing anyone .
why ?
and so i ... i prefer my banner .
and ?
no , it 's just ... a sword is a weapon .
and why was that ? did it have some particular value or power ?
i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword .
which did you prefer , your banner or your sword ?
yes ...
did n't you also carry a banner ?
quite a few .
do you have a sword ?
i leave the answer to god .
ah , yes , i forgot ... god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission ! do you think that god made the right decision , to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france ?
i ca n't read .
that is not what is written in the evidence ... look for yourself !
no ... i said `` surrender in the name of the king of france '' ...
and did n't you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven ?
i do n't know ...
do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day ?
i do n't remember . maybe .
it was on a sunday , was n't it ?
i tried to .
is it true that you launched an attack on paris ?
i do n't know , but you 're all men of the church ... why not ask him yourself ?
good advice for the french , not for the english ! do you think god hates the english ?
go onto the next question .
no . but my revelations were for the king of france , not for you .
did god forbid you to tell the truth ?
no ...
you 're afraid of displeasing god when telling the truth ? !
i wo n't tell you more about that . i 'm more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you ...
performing a miracle .
w-w-what are you doing ? !
no no , you do n't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous ... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown king clovis in this ... very ... cathedral ...
thirty years ago ? i 'm not surprised it 's gone ...
well ... at the coronation of king charles vi ...
and when was that ?
i do n't understand ... the holy oil of clovis ... it was quite full the last time i saw it ...
oh yes , my lady . all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims ... with the holy oil of clovis ... for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven , brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis ...
it is the sacred place that matters , charles -- not the size . am i correct , bishop ?
well find some other way ! be creative . tell them she fucks the devil ... hmm , not a bad idea ... why ca n't you say that ? sounds good to me ... and who can prove she does n't ?
i 'm on the side of our mother holy church . besides , a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt .
whose side are you on , cauchon ?
scared to make a mistake . supposing she 's right ... supposing she really has been sent by god ? ?
scared of a girl ?
you wo n't be able to drag anything from her that way . you also must realize that many of my colleagues are ... well , scared ...
well what are you waiting for ? you 've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys : go and torture the bitch !
but we ca n't do that unless she admits to blasphemy ...
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty ...
it is not for us to burn her , my lord . that is your prerogative .
so long as this bitch remains alive , our armies refuse to fight ! do n't you understand ? they want proof that god is on their side ... and the only way they 're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch !
be patient , my lord ... you 've seen how it is . this girl has a way with people ... but everyday we 're making progress ...
how can i calm down when i 'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court ? ! i 've had enough !
calm down , my lord , i beg you !
well then ? start proving ... or else the church will have another martyr !
but in order to do so , the church must first prove her heresy , or else you 'll be burning a martyr ...
we want her burned as a witch !
but if this trial seems fixed , i fear you 'll have the very opposite result to the one you want ...
to hell with procedure ! we paid a bloody fortune for this slut , and we can do whatever the hell we like with her , whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear ?
i understand your impatience , but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and ...
she 's loyal to her king ... it 's only to be expected that she ...
who 's running this trial , you or her ? i ca n't believe it ! this wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that ?
rouen is in english territory . i have the right to do anything i like . take them away .
what are you doing ? this is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this !
arrest them !
and god who allowed you to be caught ?
god defeated the english , not me .
your king ? ah yes , of course ... what 's he going to pay me with ? cows ? chickens ? i prefer gold , and the english have plenty . i wonder how much they 'll pay ... to have the witch of orleans in their clutches ? those english are so arrogant , they ca n't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl ... it has to have been the devil 's work .
my king will pay any ransom you ask .
guess .
where ... where am i ?
dead you 're worthless , darling .
am i ... am i dead ?
so ... here is the famous jeanne ... savior of orleans ... terror of the english ? you look pretty ordinary to me ...
i 'll be right here ... i promise .
but where are you going to be ?
do n't worry about me -- just stay in here ... and do n't move !
what about you ?
quick -- hide in here ...
i was talking to the priest , and do you know what he said to me ?
really ?
i was so worried -- we 've all been looking for you ! the english are everywhere ! o thank you , lord !
no no , i 'm fine , really ...
are you alright ? did they hurt you ?
i -- i ca n't jeanne ... i ca n't hear your confession ... i 'm sorry ...
i ask only one thing ... to hear me in confession ...
it 's not my body i want to save . it 's my soul .
i know , jeanne ... it was the only way to save you from the fire !
and you ? why did you lie ? you promised i could be confessed ...
i do n't understand , jeanne ... why did you do it ? why ?
silence her ! take her away ... !
i did n't mean it ! i did n't know what i was signing ! you tricked me ... !
you have nothing to regret ...
please ... may i have it back ...
as often as you like -- now , please -- for the love of god -- sign ! !
and may i go to mass ?
sign this , and i will confess you myself if you want .
no ... i want to be confessed .
jeanne , i beg of you ... sign ! in god 's name , do n't you understand ? i 'm trying to save you ! if you do n't sign , the english will burn you to death ! is that what you want ? ?
i am sent by god , and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment . or do you think that you are better judges than he is ?
it is for us to determine whether you are a good christian , not you .
so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me , and so prevents me from being a good christian ?
let me clarify things for you , jeanne . on the one hand there is the church triumphant , that is to say god , his saints , and the souls that are saved . and then there is the church militant , that is to say our holy father the pope , the cardinals , the prelates of the church , the clergy , and all good catholic christians . moreover this church , when assembled , is guided by the holy spirit and therefore can not be in error . that is why we ask you to submit to the church militant ... that is to say , us .
is it here ? now ? in this room ?
yes ...
tell us , jeanne ... do you often hear this voice ?
did it give you advice ? good advice ?
many things ...
what did it tell you ?
yes .
the voice was in your cell ?
praying .
what were you doing when the voice came ?
last night .
when exactly ? a day , a week -- when ?
not long ago ...
i assure you they do . so ... answer me ... when was the last time you heard this voice ?
these questions have nothing to do with your trial .
jeanne , you are not helping yourself . if you do n't answer our questions properly , your refusal will be taken into account .
and you be careful , you who claim to be my judges , for you too will be judged one day ... !
jeanne -- be careful -- you 're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment ...
not unless you hear my confession .
jeanne , listen to me very carefully . we are all men of faith , and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own . we do so in the name of our holy mother church , who never closes her arms to those who would return to her . but we can not help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority . take heed of this charitable admonition , for if you persist in refusing our help , then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers , and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you . so now ... will you please recite our lord 's prayer ?
not unless you hear my confession .
recite the lord 's prayer .
yes . in the church at domremy .
were you baptized ?
nineteen ... or thereabouts ...
how old are you ?
in a village called domremy .
show us a little more cooperation first . where were you born ?
my name is jeanne . my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me . i would like to have it back .
so ... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you 're allowed to tell us that much ?
i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you , but as to the rest , even if you threaten to cut off my head , i still wo n't tell you .
you must take the oath ! not even a king , would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith .
i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things , but as for my revelations , i 've never told anyone except my king ... charles the seventh ... the one and only king of france .
you will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked .
i do n't know what you 're going to ask me questions about . you may ask things that i wo n't want to answer .
take the holy gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked .
yes . they paid your ransom ... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at rouen .
the english ? ?
it seems that the english care more about you than the french .
but ... the king -- my king -- did n't he pay my ransom ?
your trial , jeanne . on a charge of heresy .
trial ? what trial ? ?
pierre cauchon , bishop of beauvais . as you were captured in my diocese , the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me .
who are you ?
i will hear you ... but not now , not here .
oh , thank you lord ! i 'm so glad to see you ! i need to confess ... i have n't been confessed since easter ... or been to mass ... will you hear me now ?
do n't look at the cost , look at what it brings . what is your last offer ?
20,000 ? ! but ... i heard king charles was ... financially embarrassed .
i understand . how much ?
this word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation . in fact what we -- the church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by god , as she claims . you understand that we can not allow just anybody to abuse god 's name in this manner ...
buying her ?
not so well , i regret to say . this business with the maiden ... it 's caused him endless grief and torment . that 's why he 's entrusted me with the task of ... shall we say ...
and your duke ? the duke of bedford ?
thanks be to god .
he 's feeling wonderful .
good day , sir . i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well ?
then her faith will have to be bigger .
but ... her army 's so small now ...
do n't worry , charles . if god is still with her , she will be victorious . we 're not her judges ... we 're just spectators . let her go to compiegne , as you let her go to orleans , and let god decide her fate .
i ... i ca n't stop her .
i assure you , charles , the maiden has no greater admirer than myself . but whatever our personal feelings , we can not allow her to conduct her own private war . for the sake of the kingdom , it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne ...
it 's true . there 's only one king ... people need to be reminded of that . nevertheless ... jeanne has done so much for us ...
for the sake of france , charles . and for the sake of my grandson .
you will ? ?
you 're a fine judge of character , charles . it 'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she 's a fake . but if she 's not -- then she will give you your answers ... and place the crown on your head .
you really think she 's been sent ... by god ?
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions ?
w-w-what has that got to do with this maiden ?
mmmm . yes . i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart . i know how painful it is for you ... to have loved a father ... without ever knowing if he really was yours .
you think ?
your health and happiness has always been my first concern , charles ... ever since you were a little boy -- and i think i know you better than your own mother ...
why do you have to be so bloodthirsty ? do you enjoy it ? all that blood and noise and pain ? diplomacy is far more civilized ... far safer ... and far cheaper ...
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance !
well ... we are , of course , enormously grateful for your past efforts , but your task is done . now it 's time for negotiation ... and after many months of skillful work , our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english . you see , my dear jeanne ... as it is written in the bible , `` to everything there is a season : a time for war , and a time for peace '' ...
so how would you put it ?
gave you ? well now , i would n't quite put it like that ...
why did you betray me ? paris was ours for the taking ! all i needed was another few hundred men ... why did you take back the army you gave me ?
now hold on -- you 're not captain here ... on the battlefield perhaps , but not in the royal bedchamber !
get them out of here !
... and my crown does n't fit and ... really ? ?
... you look wonderful ...
ah , jeanne ... come here ... ! this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco ... nothing is ready ...
orleans has held out for six months . i do n't suppose a few days will make much difference . take some rest .
i do n't need lodgings if we 're to be marching on orleans ...
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god , and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france .
... and what ... what did he say ?
i did n't wait long . one day i was going to mass , like i do every day , when the same strange wind started blowing again ...
you did well ...
what was my mission ? to help my country ? but how could i do that ? i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war ... so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it .
i know you 're not yet -- but you will be , soon .
i 'm ... i 'm not the king ...
there 's no need to be afraid , sire .
noooo !
i ... i do n't know ... it 'll sound like we ... betrayed her ... ?
let them come ! let them see who 's the true king of france !
there 's no time , sire -- we ca n't hold up the ceremony ... there 's no telling when the english might come back ... they 're only ten leagues away ...
he 's probably right -- let 's call a delay ...
no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier ? they do n't fight for causes these days . they fight for money . who 's going to pay them ?
my captains have sworn their support .
... to ensure our privacy . i need to talk to her . alone .
... as always , majesty ...
my dear loyal tremoille , i know i can count on you ...
your majesty , i really think you ...
tremoille , i 'm not even king yet ... who 'd want to assassinate me ?
supposing she 's an assassin ?
my astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- leo , with virgo rising . have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion ?
your majesty , i urge you not to see this woman . it all reeks of a burgundian trap !
the other half .
i can see her if i want to . i mean , with half of france in the hands of the english , what have i got to lose ?
not exactly . she wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse . bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury , i fail to see how you can afford such an adventure .
if she comes from burgundy it makes a difference . it might be a trap ... look ... signed `` x '' . what sort of name is `` x '' ? or must we conclude that a messenger of god ca n't even write her own name ?
what difference does it make where she comes from ?
you must n't see her , my lord . we know nothing about her ... we do n't even know if she is from lorraine .
she says she 'll be here tomorrow ... !
she pretends she 's been sent by god ! these charlatans -- it 's a pity there is n't enough wood to burn them all !
that 's enough ! you will answer the question ... or face the consequences !
go on to the next question .
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel ... or a man ... how would you recognize him ? by what he said ?
i 'm more interested in what he says , not what he looks like .
is it long and hanging down ?
yes .
does he have hair ?
his face .
you told us about the appearance of this ... voice . what exactly did you see ? part of it ... or all of it ?
go and ask him yourself .
then why did your king believe in you without any proof ?
if there was , i did n't see it ...
when you saw your king for the first time , was there an angel over his head ?
i must offer to the duke . i will give you his answer tomorrow .
8,000. we ca n't raise more ... we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity .
20,000 gold crowns .
may i , without offending you , inquire how generous ?
i know ... but the english want her very badly , and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous .
it is all his majesty can afford . he has even donated his very own personal savings . his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families .
that 's not a lot .
5,000 gold crowns .
the english wo n't wait .
not yet .
well ... ? shall we go ?
the bridge wo n't wait !
we need another ten minutes ...
stand by with the battering-rams ...
i know what i 'm doing , so either lend a hand or go back to bed !
jeanne , what are you doing with that ... you 've got it back to front ...
we 're taking back the tourelles !
what 's going on ?
the wind will be with us ! do as i say .
the wind will be against us ...
position the long-bows over there , crossbows over there -- and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees ...
sooner is better than later !
can we -- uh -- discuss this later ?
dunois ... was it you who ordered the attack ? answer me ? !
knowing what i know ? enormous gratitude .
jeanne , put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel , if you were me ?
ah , so that 's it . to you i 'm just a girl .
jeanne , you have to understand -- it 's not easy for us -- i mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well , with all due respect , by a ... girl .
`` be patient , be patient '' ... is that the only advice you can ever come up with ? ? i 've shown more patience than a dozen saints !
what complicated about it ? all you have to do is do what you 're told -- what could be simpler than that ? i 'm the drum on which god is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it 's bursting my ears -- but you 're all so full of your own voices , you 're deaf to his !
jeanne , with respect -- we ca n't just attack the tourelles like that -- it 's a very complicated matter and ...
you know , i feel a great sorrow for you , because you 're laughing now , but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god .
god .
jeanne , that really makes no sense at all . the tourelles is virtually impregnable ... besides , if we 're on the other side of the river attacking the tourelles , what 's to stop talbot attacking the city from the north ?
we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace . if they refuse , we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles .
so ... what is the message ?
fine -- go now if you want , but not with me ! you may have a duty to god but i have a duty to my people , and my people are starving ! so right now i 'm going to take the food back to the city , and if you can please calm down , and let me accompany you to orleans , it will be my honor to welcome you .
you may have been with your counsel , but i 've been with mine , and i 'm telling you , god 's counsel is wiser than yours , and he 's telling me to speak to the english -- now !
well . i 'd love to see that , but after taking counsel with my captains , i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city , then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything .
because if they do n't , i 'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever !
because ... because -- i mean -- the english have a broad sense of humor , but ... i mean , you do n't understand ... to them you 're a witch , working for the devil . what makes you think they 'll listen to you ?
for what ?
wait , wait ...
he 's on the other side of the river .
good . can you bring me to him ?
i know ...
it 's coming -- i rode on ahead . i have to speak with the captain of the english army ... his name 's talbot ...
everywhere . where is the food ?
good . where are the english ?
yes ... they were .
were you sent by lord dunois ?
as long as she brings food and supplies , she 'll be welcome .
but ... do n't you think we should at least ... go and ... welcome her ?
xaintrailles ... ! do n't talk to me about miracles ... if i was still sitting there waiting for a miracle , i 'd be dead now . anyway ...
and it 's not the first one ! they say she saved a little boy who was dying of ...
yes , it 's a miracle .
the dauphin -- he 's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by jeanne -- the maiden from lorraine -- is n't it wonderful ? !
calm yourself , xaintrailles . now slowly . who has finally done what ?
my lord dunois ... i have wonderful news ! -- finally -- he 's sending her to us -- thanks be to god -- we 're saved -- it 's wonderful !
no good ? this is a disaster !
this is no good !
good idea ...
yes . we can pray .
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes !
me too ...
i do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked !
oh , but i forgot ! it was a sunday ... that explains it . god 's day off .
damn right !
god ... why of course -- we 'd forgotten about him ! strange , i do n't seem to remember seeing him at agincourt .
that 'll put fire in my soldiers !
brilliant idea ... but to be really effective , why not send a whole army of virgins ?
to hell with your voices -- it 's time to face facts ! we have nothing to do here ... none of us ... not even you . you should go home , jeanne .
but my voices ... they promised me ...
he never sent them ... do n't you understand ? he does n't want this war anymore ... he has his crown now , that 's all he ever wanted ...
but ... where is dunois ... where are the men the king promised me ?
jeanne ... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers .
of course i do ? bring them up !
do you know how to count ?
never look behind -- only ahead !
jeanne , look behind you .
right behind us -- dunois with another then thousand men !
reinforcements ? where ? ?
so ... bring up the reinforcements !
jeanne ... we 're not enough ...
i know , but so is the enemy -- they 're falling back -- paris is ours ... !
jeanne ... the men are exhausted !
maybe ... i do n't know ... but first we have to confess ...
bravo ! what about all the other hundreds of prisoners ? do we let them go too ?
i care ! and i care because god cares ! all life is precious to god -- even his -- even yours and mine ...
jeanne ... let him do it . one more dead body 's not going to make any difference , so who cares ?
for weeks you 've been asking for this ... well now you have it !
no ... not like this ...
you look disappointed ... is n't this what you wanted ?
perfectly .
clear ?
the english are rebuilding it .
but the bridge has been pulled down !
we return to orleans ... across the bridge , at the tourelles .
i do n't think . i leave that to god . i 'm nothing in all this , i 'm just the messenger .
and ... what does jeanne think ?
it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same . why must you complicate what is so simple ?
but will you also submit to the decision of the church ?
i ... submit to our lord .
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man ?
it was just ... more convenient as i was among soldiers ...
you also cut your hair short like a man , and in the bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man ! it proves your desire to deceive ...
the clothes are not important ...
who told you to wear men 's clothes ?
oh ? perhaps someone pushed you then ?
no !
and you did n't jump of your free will ?
yes , but ...
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge ?
i know , but that 's not the way things happened ...
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin ? no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created !
that 's now what i meant ...
how can you deny it when you just said `` i 'd rather die than fall into the hands of the english '' ... ?
no ... !
so when you jumped , you wanted to kill yourself ?
no ...
did your voice tell you to jump ?
i had been sold to the english . i 'd rather die than fall into their hands .
tell us , jeanne ... why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir ?
here -- take this instead .
yeah ...
that 's different ... i mean ... we were fighting for a ... for a cause !
besides , what about these ... ?
because ... because you just ca n't !
why not ? he has good teeth ...
but you ca n't just kill a man for his teeth !
nothing ... just taking his teeth .
stop it ! what are you doing ?
we still believe in you , jeanne . if it were up to me , i 'd chase every goddamn englishman into the ocean . but it 's not up to us anymore -- it 's up to the king ...
you do n't believe me anymore ?
i said , kneel !
jeanne , if you do n't mind ... i 'll stay standing ... this armor ... it 's a nightmare to get back up ...
a few teeth ... that 's the price of his life ?
jeanne ... the man has n't been paid for six months -- that 's his only reward . let him take a few teeth ...
if you kill him , you kill me !
jeanne ... get up ... this is ridiculous ...
take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first !
it 's not possible ...
... the smell of victory , jeanne ! mmmmmmm ! i love it !
you call this ... glory ... ? all this ... this blood ... this smell of ...
won ? ! such a small word will never do ! this is victory , jeanne , this is ... glory !
we ... won ? !
not for long ...
what 's the use ? the drawbridge is up !
prepare these as battering-rams !
i 'd sooner die than use magic !
physicians are a waste of time . you 'll have more luck with this charm of mine ... it saved my life at agincourt !
do n't swear ...
i swear i 'll never swear again in my life if you save her life ! but i 'm warning you , if you let her die , then you 're the biggest ...
were the men confessed ? where are the priests ?
god knows , but it was a bad idea !
what happened ? who gave the order to attack ?
they will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that .
jesus christ ... the goddamn english will pay for this !
then , lord dunois , show me the way to the other side of the river ...
jeanne , let me introduce the king 's half brother , the dogged lord dunois .
sorry jeanne ... did you both meet already ?
la hire , i 'm warning you -- do n't swear !
hey , my friend ! i 'm glad to see your ugly damn face again !
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river ? ?
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god , would n't you say ?
still , pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would n't you say ?
yes , i was given a few , but i never had time to wear them ...
what about all those dresses you were given ... silk dresses were n't they ?
no .
as much as for a lord ? what an honor ! did your king give you other wealth apart from horses ?
five steeds and a few hackneys ...
how many did he give you ?
my king .
who gave you that horse ?
yes ... a half-steed ... white .
when you were taken prisoner at compiegne , did you have a horse ?
let 's see .
yes , my lord .
you think you are ready now ?
no ...
you know what you just signed , jeanne ? you just signed away my existence ... for you i 'm a lie , an illusion . you see ? in the end , you were the one who abandoned me ...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself ?
yes ...
are you willing to follow all his commandments ?
yes i am .
do you think you are ready ?
there 's nothing for me to do here anymore ... i do n't belong here i want to be with him now ...
are you sent by god ?
yes ... of course ... when you do n't need me anymore .
are you going to leave me too ?
i do n't think so .
my voices ... my voices ... do you think they will ever come back ?
good . but `` love your enemies '' ... body and soul .
`` love your enemies '' ...
no , i ...
do you think this cross will protect you ?
because ... because i do n't know what else to do to please him .
what for ?
i 'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful ...
what are you doing on the wall ?
i -- i cleaned up my room , look ... and i said my prayers ... all of them ... and ...
really ?
i never took pleasure in hurting anyone ?
ah , pleasure ... that 's a difficult word to define . when does the pain end and the pleasure begin ... ? when did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand ... ?
why are you doing this to me ? ? do you get pleasure from hurting me ?
i do n't agree . why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time ?
i agree ...
no , i do not think so . i do n't think that killing each other will ever bring peace .
no , no , you did fine . i 'd even say well done . besides , most of the ones you killed probably deserved it , do n't you think ?
i ... i was defending myself as best i could ! everyone has the right to defend themselves , do n't they ? or should i have let myself be killed ?
`` let all who love me follow me '' ... where does god get mentioned ? come on jeanne , be honest . you fought for yourself , in your name .
really ?
yes ! we fought and killed in his name ... the king of heaven !
in his name ? ?
no , but ... why did n't he stop it ? or did he get pleasure , watching us killing each other in his name ?
is he the one who spread all this blood and misery ?
yes ... yes ! and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place ... if he 's so powerful ... he said he 's `` the creator of heaven and earth , the source of all life ... '' he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery ? why did n't he ?
so your memory 's coming back ?
stop , stop ... i ca n't remember ! the battles were all so confusing ... there was so much smoke , dust , noise ... i was being attacked on all sides , so ... maybe ... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself ...
oh no ? how about this one ?
no ! i do n't want to know anymore ! leave me alone ! i did n't kill that man !
oh ? you ca n't remember ? let me help your memory ...
i 'm not lying , i ... i ca n't remember ... leave me alone !
true -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another ? there are many ways a sword might find itself in a field ...
but ... it did n't just get there by itself .
no . that was a sword in a field .
like ... like the wind ... and the clouds ... and ... the bells ... and what about that sword lying in the field ... that was a sign ... !
what signs ?
no , but ... he sent me so many signs !
you mean god said , `` i need you , jeanne ? ''
yes ... lots of things !
god asked you to do something ?
because ! because i 've always been faithful to god , and i 've followed everything he said ... and i 've done everything he asked me ...
why would they ?
what do you mean , they wo n't come ?
they wo n't come anyway .
because ... i have to be alone !
why not ?
no , no -- you ca n't stay or they wo n't come !
i want to see that . do you mind if i stay ... on the side ? i wo n't bother you .
yes ... that 's what i pray for ... !
they 're going to come and visit you in here ?
my ... visions ...
who ?
yes !
why ? are you waiting for someone else ?
what are you doing here ? please ... leave ... you ca n't stay here ...
why were you yelling like that ? !
i told you already ... i 'm here to set you free ...
i do n't understand . what do you want from me ?
oh , so you do n't want war anymore ? you want to be at peace ? you want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it ?
i do n't know -- i do n't care anymore -- i just want to be at peace !
oh ? and just because you realize now , everybody else should forgive you ? !
no , no ... i 'm just so tired , and lost , and ... i did n't realize what i was doing !
that 's too easy . one minute you want to die , the next you want to live ... do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you do n't want it anymore ?
how can you pretend that you love god when you 're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you ? life is a gift , you should know that by now jeanne -- a gift from god . you know what he 'd say to you , if he was here ? `` what are you doing to me , jeanne ? ''
i am true -- to my lord , the king of heaven . he knows how much i love him -- that 's all that matters to me ...
if you were true to yourself ... if your faith was firm , you would n't need to run away from yourself like this ...
i ... i never lied !
you 'll be dead soon enough anyway , so why be in such a hurry ? why not face up to your lies ? it 's your lies you ca n't stand anymore ...
everything ! prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- i ca n't stand it anymore -- i 'd rather die !
and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ?
i ... i 'm leaving ... i ca n't take anymore ...
i might ask you the same question .
what are you doing out here ?
nothing . i 'm here to set you free ...
i ... do n't know ... what do you want from me ?
who are you to decide if you should live or die ?
i do n't know ... please ... tell me i 'm dead ...
you think god is n't big enough to deliver his own messages ?
i do n't know ... i thought ...
no ... no ... i 'm just a messenger ... he needs me ... a higher calling ...
who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil ? are you god ?
i am that i am . you do n't like my face ? maybe you prefer this one ...
who ... who are you ... ?
i -- i -- i ...
what have you done to me ?
playing ...
jeanne ... what are you doing ?
i want to be at one with him now .
soon you 'll be able to take the holy mass , and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood , you will be at one with him .
i want to be with him always ...
jeanne , be patient .
i do n't want to wait for his call .
jeanne ... calm down ... ! calm down , jeanne !
then what will ? and what will bring her back ? and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me ? why did n't he take my life instead of hers ? it was my fault -- i was late -- she gave me her hiding place ... ! !
i realize your anger , jeanne , but we must learn to forgive . it 's hard , but revenge will never bring about peace .
i know jesus says to love our enemies but i ca n't -- i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever !
only god knows the answer to that .
why did she have to die ?
i heard about your sister , and i ... understand your pain ...
perhaps ... but wherever he comes from , i think you should listen to him , because it sounds like he 's giving you very good advice .
he says ... he says i must be good ... and help everyone ... and take care of myself . do you think he 's coming from the sky ?
and what does he say to you ?
beautiful .
what ... does he ... look like ?
he never says his name .
who is this `` he '' ?
well , i try and talk to him , but mostly he 's the one who does the talking .
him ?
i feel safe here . and it 's where i can talk to him .
then ... why are you here so often ?
yes , it is .
so ... everything sounds ... wonderful ?
oh yes , i play with them ... lots ...
and what about your other friends ... you do n't like playing with them ?
oh yes , my sister 's just ... she 's ... wonderful .
good , good . and your sister ... catherine -- she 's still your best friend ?
oh yes , she 's ... wonderful .
and your mother -- everything 's fine with her ?
oh yes ... very .
well no , but ... jeanne , are you happy at home ?
is that bad ?
jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time , we 'd spend our whole life in church .
he already did , but i want god to forgive me too .
i 'm sure he 'll forgive you .
my father 's .
whose were they ?
they were n't my shoes . mine were too small .
there 's no sin in charity , jeanne .
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some .
so ... alright . what terrible sin have you committed since then that ca n't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven ?
i need to confess again .
but you already confessed this morning ...
i need to confess .
you know i 'm always happy to see you , jeanne , but to keep coming here twice , three times a day ...
do n't forget , mr. wladek , they hang them for helping jews .
a singer . her husband 's an actor . i knew them well . good people . i 'd like to talk to her .
a beauty . who is she ?
yes .
someone you know ?
it 's like this ... i ... we ... all of them .
why are you here , mr. wladek ?
who wants me to stop ?
i 'm sorry , mr wladek , he wants you to stop .
he 's still a doctor .
dorota , do n't be ridiculous , he 's a pediatrician .
i 'll get dr luczak , we can trust him .
you ca n't , it 's too dangerous .
i 'm going to get a doctor .
oh , yes . i remember .
this is my husband . wladyslaw szpilman . marek gebczynski sent him .
christmas . this is not a good time to have children . but then ...
when 's your baby due ?
dead .
and how 's yurek ?
just over a year .
how long have you been married ?
he 'll be here soon .
i 've been in hiding . i need somewhere to stay .
he 'll be back before curfew .
i need help .
michal dzikiewicz . he 's my husband .
i 'm sorry - i was given this address . i 'm looking for a mr -- -- a mr dzikiewicz .
sit .
come in ! come in !
dorota .
wladyslaw szpilman .
i 'll see you ... soon .
that 's what i said , it 's so - it 's too absurd !
do n't worry , it wo n't last long .
fine , no , not really , they arrested my cousin , but jurek says they 'll let him out . this is disgraceful .
how are you doing ?
i did n't want to come , i did n't want to see all this , but i could n't stop myself .
dorota !
wladek , please .
oh , mr szpilman , you 're quite ... quite wonderful .
no one plays chopin like you .
wladek , please .
i 've always loved your playing , mr. szpilman .
yes ! it was ... it was unforgettable .
really ?
you know something ? meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful .
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks . and at last he gave in and said , 'all right , come with me tomorrow , ' and so i came and they bombed the station .
it 's nothing .
my name 's dorota , i 'm jurek 's sister . oh ! you 're bleeding .
who are you ?
i came specially to meet you today . i love your playing , but what a day to choose .
hello .
american jews , and there 's lots of them , what have they done for us ? what do they think they 're doing ? people here are dying , have n't got a bite to eat . the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany !
for what ? for my tie ?
how will we sleep ?
to tell you the truth , i thought it would be worse .
does n't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ? where will we get them ?
let me see this .
let 's find out .
will i still be able to play ?
what are you doing ?
what did i tell you ?
that 's your decision . but when they storm the flat , throw yourself out of die window - do n't let them get you alive . i have poison on me , they wo n't get me alive either !
where do you want me to go ? look at me . no , no , i 'm not leaving . ca n't i take my chances here ?
the gestapo found our weapons . they 've arrested janina and andrzej . they 're bound to find out about this place , too - you must get away at once .
what 's happened ?
i 'm on the run !
what 's happened ?
get your things together , you have to leave !
here .
yes , but sometimes i 'm still not sure which side of the wall i 'm on .
must feel better this side of the wall .
you 'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon .
i 'll be fine .
it 's not going to be very comfortable .
thanks .
wish i knew you better .
what ?
funny time to say this .
what ?
halina ?
they 're hunting people on the streets . they 've picked up henryk .
calm down , what , what is it ?
oh my god , it 's terrible , you 've got to do something , oh my god !
what 's happened ?
what , i 'm working , what ?
have you seen this ?
people i know . they said you 're an important man .
who told you ?
yitzchak , they told me you had influence .
then there 's nothing i can do . he should 've joined us when i gave him the chance..
i 've no money .
it costs .
can you help us ?
oh , you need me now , yes , now you need me !
can you help ?
tough luck .
believe me , they 've picked him up .
i have n't seen him .
henryk 's in there .
i 'm doing you people a favour . and what about you , wladek ? you 're a great pianist . and we 've got an excellent police jazz band . they 'd welcome you with open arms . join us . you 've got no work ...
yes , please .
yes , i 'm looking at you and that 's why i 'm here . your whole family can have a better life . you want to go on struggling for survival , selling books on the street ?
but why me ? i thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers . look at my father , look at us , i mean ...
someone 's got to do it , henryk .
oh ? more jewish police ? you mean you want me to wear a cap like yours , beat up jews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit . i see !
do n't be clever with me , henryk . i 've come here as a friend . they 're bringing jews in from all over the country . soon there 'll be half a million people in the ghetto . we need more jewish police ...
who 's recruiting ?
we 're recruiting .
your work , yes , playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto , they do n't give a damn about people 's sufferings , they do n't even notice what 's going on around them !
boys , boys ...
what 's the matter with you all ? have you lost your sense of humour ?
henryk , i said nothing bad .
okay , then i 'll tell you something funny . you know who i mean by dr. raszeja .
and , please , tonight , for once , i do n't want anything bad talked about . let 's enjoy our meal .
sit down , have tea , i 'll start lunch when the girls get back .
what 's this about ?
do they ?
the germans go into jewish homes and they just take what they want , furniture , valuables , anything .
what d'you mean , take the table away ?
and suppose they take the table away ?
yes , that 's why i brought it .
very appropriate .
'if you prick us , do we not bleed ? if you tickle us , do we not laugh ? if you poison us , do we not die ? and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ? '
what are you reading ?
you 'll be deported .
otherwise what ?
you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto , otherwise ...
what 's that mean , no employment certificate ?
hungry .
what 's the matter ? are you sick ?
that 's also my business .
you 're mad , that 's your trouble , you 're mad .
it 's nothing to do with you . it 's me they wanted , not you . why do you interfere in other people 's business ?
they were taking you away .
i can look after myself !
pay him ? with what ? with what could i pay him ? every zloty i earn we spend on food !
what did you pay him ?
i did n't grovel , i asked him to help .
did you beg , did you grovel to that piece of shit , that cockroach ?
you 're out , are n't you ?
you go to heller , did i ask you to talk to him ?
what are you talking about , my tie ? what 's my tie got to do with anything ? i need the tie for my work .
well , you know what 's funny ? you 're funny with that ridiculous tie .
it 's not funny .
you do n't know , believe me . they bribe the guards . the guards turn a blind eye . they 're bringing in cartloads , food , tobacco , liquor , french cosmetics , and the poor are dying all around them and they do n't give a damn .
i know .
three lousy zlotys . and there are people here making millions .
that 's better than yesterday .
just one . dostoevsky . the idiot . three zlotys .
you sell anything ?
no . three hundred and sixty thousand , so it 'll be easy .
but ... they wo n't get all of us ... we 'll ... it 's too small ... there 's four hundred thousand of us in warsaw !
just shut up .
a good place for what ? he 's insane !
of course they 'll notice it . but look -- this is a good place for something .
we leave the money and the watch on the table . and we cover it like this . in full view . the germans will search high and low , i promise you , they 'll never notice it .
we use what ?
you know what we do ? we use psychology .
that makes a change .
no , no . listen , i 've been thinking --
it certainly was .
mama , that was a great dinner .
warsaw 's not the only radio station .
they bombed us , we 're off the air .
what good ? wladek , i 'm surprised at you . they died with dignity , that 's what good it did . and you know something else ? now the poles will rise . we 're ready . we 'll fight , too . you 'll see .
yes , but what good did it do ?
they 're in shock . they did n't expect it . nobody expected it . jews fighting back ? who 'd have thought ?
yes , so did the germans .
wladek , stop that . it 's over now . just be proud it happened . my god , did they put up a fight .
should never have come out . i should 've stayed there , fought with them .
no one thought they 'd hold out so long .
please , do n't insult us . can you do something for him ?
can you help ? i 've no money ...
i 'm not , but majorek is .
i did n't know you were in the certificate business .
why did n't you come to me ?
i 've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father . i 've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but i need one more for my father . i 've been trying all the firms , the shops ...
rumours , rumours , you take it all too much to heart , wladek .
you 've heard the rumours they 're going to resettle us in the east ?
i have to say you look terrible . what 's the trouble ?
not this week .
i thought you 'd be off on tour , playing london , paris , new york ?
toilets ?
five hundred . you know how many people on average read one copy ? twenty . that makes ten thousand readers . these will start the uprising . majorek hides them in his underpants . and leaves them in toilets .
there are always notices going up .
there are notices going up . the city 's to be cleansed of undesirables .
you 're too well known , wladek . and you know what ? you musicians do n't make good conspirators . you 're too ... too musical .
but i want to help , i want to .
you 're an artist , wladek , you keep people 's spirits up . you do enough .
jehuda , give me something to do .
bad news , you crazy ? you have no world view , wladek , that 's your trouble . the news could n't be better . the moment hitler invaded russia , i knew we 'd be all right . remember napoleon . same business . the germans will freeze to death , please god .
i do n't know why i come here every evening , it 's always such bad news .
the germans are advancing on kharkhov .
so , what 's the news ?
no , i 'm a socialist . i have brothers everywhere . they bring me news and food . we care about our fellow human beings . workers of the world unite .
you 're amazing , jehuda .
ah , here . today 's news from the other side .
maybe , maybe not , but , jurek , do n't be offended , i did n't call to discuss my future career .
... not even music , nothing , no radios for the poles . but i 'm sure you 'll find work , wladek , a pianist like you .
yes , i know , but jurek , jurek ...
fine , we 're fine in the circumstances . but i can guess what you 've called about . there 's nothing we can do ; they wo n't reopen the station --
fine , we 're fine , thank you , and you ?
wladek ! how are you ?
jurek ? wladek szpilman .
liar , you fell asleep . pig !
i was listening , kitten .
if i play like an angel , why do n't you listen ?
takes one to know one ! pig !
you 're a dirty pig !
dirty pig !
bitch !
pig !
cow !
pig !
i treat you like dirt because you are dirt .
you know what ? you treat me like dirt !
what d'you think i mean , kitten ? i forgot , that 's what i mean .
puppydog , what d'you mean , you forgot ?
be ready to leave in two days ' time . same place as last night .
you made contact ?
i tried your friends . they 're not at that address any more . but .
i know . but last summer , i worked for a day in zelazna brama square . i saw someone i knew . a singer . her husband 's an actor . they 're old friends . i 've written their names down . and their address . if they 're still there . janina godlewska and andrzej bogucki . good people . majorek , you go into the town every day . would you try and make contact ? ask them if they 'd help me get out of here ?
it 's easy to get out , it 's how you survive on the other side that 's hard .
have a favour to ask . i want to get out of here .
if you need help ...
they 're going to start the final resettlement now . we know what it means . we sent someone out . zygmunt . a good man . his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw . he got to sokolow . a local railwayman told him the tracks are divided , one branch leading to treblinka . he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw forked to treblinka and returned empty . no transports of food are ever seen on that line . and civilians are forbidden to approach the treblinka station . they 're exterminating us . wo n't take them long . we 're sixty thousand left . out of half a million . mostly young people . and this time we 're going to fight . we 're in good shape . we 're organised . we 're prepared .
since last night . i was pleased to see you .
how long have you been here ?
stop it , wladek .
i 'm sorry , i did my best , i thought the certificates would save us all .
god forbid !
no , no , no , i 'm staying put . if i 'm going to die , i prefer to die at home .
i 'm not going anywhere .
pack , wladek , there 's no time .
and what do you think you 'll do while you 're setting up a new line of defence ? wander round lugging your suitcases ?
out of warsaw . where ?
out of warsaw .
where are we going ?
pack , darling , get your things , pack .
i 've been worried sick .
it 's a little cut , nothing .
thank god - wladek ! you 're wounded .
why did n't you come sooner ? it 's been over two weeks .
you do n't want to worry about that . my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice . in my opinion , jaundice is not very serious . drink up .
does n't matter . you 've nothing to worry about . i 'll visit often .
sorry , i do n't remember .
warsaw radio . i was a technician . i saw you almost every day .
no , i do n't think so ?
you do n't remember me , mr. szpilman ?
szpilman . good name for a pianist .
szpilman .
tell me your name . i 'll listen out for you .
i 'll play the piano again . on polish radio .
i 've got another one . warmer . what will you do when it 's all over ?
what about you ?
do n't thank me . thank god . it 's his will that we should survive . well . that 's what we have to believe .
i do n't know how to thank you .
not yet .
are the russians here ?
we 're getting out .
what 's happening ?
the russians . on the other side of the river . all you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks .
what 's all that gunfire ?
show me .
in the attic .
where are you hiding ?
a pianist .
i am ... i was a pianist .
what 's your work ?
where do you live ?
i was ... i was trying to open this tin .
what the hell are you doing ?
... without a shred of manners .
we have just come from george banes ' and they have taken him over . it is no wonder he is leaving , he has got in too deep with the natives . they sit on his floor as proud as kings , but without a shred of manners .
ohh no , it makes my skin creep !
yes , like a cave .
ohhh , it 's so dark , it 's like a dank cave .
oh yes , dear too - terrible ! awful ! '' '
to be deaf ?
i ca n't imagine a fate worse than being dumb . turn around .
it will be very dramatic .
well you stopped combing your hair , which is a good thing , it was looking over done . you see these are the slits that the heads will go through , show him nessie ... they 'll be dead , the reverend is going to use animal blood , no doubt it will be very dramatic . tea !
watch his hand
careful ! watch his hand .
watch your feet !
watch your feet !
well he has nothing to pack , but he is leaving . and it is just as well ; nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
baines is packing up ?
he is quite altered , as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him . well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone .
that is good , yes .
how are the lessons going ? ada nods enthusiastically . he 's getting on all right ? ada nods again good .
certainly , there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent .
and with time she will , i 'm sure , become affectionate .
oh indeed . cotton ' .
there is something to be said for silence
oh , yes , yes of course , a concern .
well , she was very violent with the gown . she tore off a chunk of lace . if had n't been there i 'd have sworn she 'd used her teeth
no , it was a table .
no sound at all ?
i knew she was mute , but now i 'm thinking it 's more than that . i 'm wondering if she 's not brain affected .
it 's strange is n't it ? i mean it 's not a piano , it does n't make any sound .
like it were a piano ?
what would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano ?
yes , it 's unholy .
well , that is a strong opinion .
ohhh ... dear . not another word from the shock , yes it would be .
one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest , a great storm blew up out of nowhere . but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice , nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch ... and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb ! she- never-spoke-another-word .
mother used to sing the songs in german and her voice would echo across the valleys
ohhh i 've never been there .
the alps .
which mountains are those dear ?
and where did they get married ?
well , yes , in austria where be conducted the royal orchestra .
i thought she met your father in luxemburg .
... . they met when my mother was an opera singer ... in luxemburg ...
ohh the tag is broken .
my real father was a famous german composer
i miss you .
no , i love her , we will be a family . i have her piano . i will mend it , she will get better .
i worry for you .
i 'll be back .
go peini ... haere atu e peini .
you have spare wife here peini . you get rnana for that . our chief four wives .
she lives her own life in new jersey , america .

no , no bible readers .
i got the good wife for you peini . she pray good . clean . read bible . you sleep her peini . she chief daughter .
what are they ?
no , but her words are in my head . i know what you think , that it 's a trick , that i 'm making it up . no , the words i heard , were her words .
spoken words ?
she has spoken to me . i heard her voice . there was no sound , but i beard it here . her voice was there in my head . i watched her lips , they did not make the words , yet the harder i listened the clearer i heard her , as clear as i hear you , as dear as i hear my own voice .
no , not words .
no , words . you have never heard words ?
you mean in signs ?
has ada ever spoken to you ?
well , thank you , i expect she will appreciate it .
it was more to your wife that i gave it .
well , i doubt i want it very much myself .
no , no payment . i have given it back . i do n't want it .
and what does this do to our bargain ? i can not afford the piano if you mean me to pay .
no .
you do n't want to learn .
i do n't want to learn .
i do n't think you should have given up the piano . i will make sure you are properly taught , with music written on to sheets and ...
nothing just yet
i 'll have to come and hear you play . what do you play .
ada says you 're doing well with the piano ?
yes , why not .
te , kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci . unsubtitled
t-w~e-l-v~e .
yes , i suppose you would .
i 'll have to get lessons . it would n't be much use without them .
well baines the music lover , i never would have known . hidden talents george .
yes , i thought that .
you 'd have to organise it up here .
the piano on the beach ? ada 's piano ?
the piano .
what for ?
i 'd like to make a swap .
good , flatish land with reliable water , why ? i do n't have money . what are you about ?
yes
on your property ?
those 80 acres , that cross the stream , what do you think of them ?
no , no they know another track - to the side of this .
they want more money . they are trying to make two days out of it ?
but we came down this way did n't we ? i 'm sure we did .
someone died here . it 's tapu .
what 's he say ?
she 's stunted , that 's one thing .
she looks tired .
i have the key here , look , i 'll have it mended ...
she says , throw it overboard . she does n't want it . she says it 's spoiled
what ?
it 's quite safe , they are managing ...
she says , throw the piano overboard .
what did she say ?
jesus ! i 'll kill him ! i 'll kill him . what did she tell him ?
he chopped it off
quiet down ! shhh ! where is she ?
what happened ?
he says you 're not to see her or he 'll chop her up !
i just want to listen .
everyone has to practice .
i 'd rather not play . i want to listen and learn that way .
she wants to see what you can do .
the marks do not come out . they are scars and hardened skin .
wash them again .
they are washed .
you have to wash them .
i 'm sorry , i ca n't do that . i do n't have the time . goodbye
please take us to the beach where we landed .
take this to baines . tell him if he ever tries to see her again i 'll take off another and another and another !
mama .
play a song then
do i know any gigs ?
play a gig .
what will i play ?
is it all right ? are n't you going to play something ? ada pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano . she rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys , she turns from habit over her left shoulder where stewart waits crossed armed . quickly she removes her hands , stands and gestures flora to play . flora proudly takes ~p the seat , she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and stewart .
hah , you 're very cunning ada , but i 've seen through you , i 'm not going to lose the land this way . wait here !
he 's given it to us .
tomorrow .
and when is the next lesson ?
she never gives him a turn .
you 've missed this bit .
i know why mr. baines ca n't play the piano .
he wants to improve himself ... and you will be able to play on it ... teach him to look after it .
she says it 's her piano , and she wo n't have him touch it . he 's an oaf , he ca n't read , he 's ignorant .
what does she say ?
on your piano , that is the swap .
what on ?
hello .
hello , then .
let us not discuss this further . i am very pleased ... .
we ca n't leave the piano
yes and so do i , but there are too few of us here to carry it . too - heavy
she wants it to come .

you 're a con man , and you blew it like a pimp . i did n't teach ya to be no pimp .
i checked the place out . there were n't no dicks in there .
in one goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ? you coulda been nailed .
all of it .
how much did ya lose ?
i had some appointments .
you 're late . where you been ?
he had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house . made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops , but did n't hit nothin ' .
he 's not comin ' in . not to get bounced off a job anyway .
and tell cole i wanta see him when he gets in .
use salino . it 'll take a little longer , but there wo n't be any holes in it .
they did n't think he 'd be so cagey , that 's all . they 'll get him next time .
then why ai n't he dead ?
salino ? why waste our best people on a small-time job like this ? it ai n't no heavy gee we 're after . the guy 's a five and dime grifter .
we 'll put salino on it . i need somebody careful .
we 'll be waitin ' .
i just got the count . we 'll put the take on the 4:15 .
they did 14 grand in evanston , 16.5 is gary , and 20 in cicero . looks like you 're bringing up the rear , granger .
well , hell , you got the whole chicago south side . how do ya expect the eight lousy spots i 've got to compete with that ?
we cleared 22 here .
believe me , the man 's gon na be real happy . looks like we cleared over ten grand this week .
okay , finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can . i do n't wanta be here all night .
hell yes . he does this every year . there 's nothing to worry about .
you been making your payoffs , have n't ya ?
we had a few problems with the law this morning . the mayor promised the jaycees to get tough on the rackets again , so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good . nothing serious , it just put us a little behind for the day .
granger , this is combs . why have n't we heard from ya ? everybody else is in .
shove off , duff .
he was a tear-off rat . he got what he deserved . no sense helpin ' pay his bills .
he was a con man , was n't he ?
was n't no problem a mine .
you the duff that did n't come up with his end when little jeff was sent up ?
buck duff . i was in maxwell 's boost in troy .
listen to me , hooker . what ever you do , do n't go back to your place tonight , do n't go anyplace you usually go , ya hear me ? get outa town or somethin ' , but ...
aw christ , it does n't make no difference now . if snyder knows about it so does everybody else . he never gets anything first ... damn , there 's no answer at luther 's .
what the hell you gon na do when snyder rushes his finger right to lonnegan ? you 're committin ' suicide , kid .
i did . that stuff i gave him was counterfeit . they 'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it .
i thought you blew all your money .
forget it .
i do n't look any good in clothes and i do n't know how to drive . what else ya got to sell , eirie ?
you could buy yourself some things . clothes , or a nice car ...
i like griftin ' .
if you saved a little , you would n't have to grift so much .
there 's always a depression on .
you ai n't gon na have nothin ' if you do n't lay off them games of chance . there 's a depression on ya know .
we were partners . if it were n't for luther i 'd still be hustlin ' pinball down at gianelli 's . i do n't need anything more than i got .
aw come on , it was the only thing to do . he knew he was holdin ' ya back .
how do you like that coleman , huh ? after three years .
the bastard . he can blow his nose all the way .
straight north . he was gon na take it all and run .
which way did he do , eirie ?
hey , luther told me he was carrying a wad , but i did n't figure this much .
what am i supposed to do ? call him for cheating better than me ?
i know i give him four threes . we ca n't let him get away with that .
nothin ' . they got ta be outa there early . i 'm gon na bust that bastard in one play .
what do ya want the others to get ?
i do n't care . load me a deck . set it up for threes and nines . i 'll cut it in on his deal .
you 've only been playin three hours , doyle .
i 've had it with that bum , floyd . stack me a cooler .
good lad .
yes sir .
name 's danny mccoy . no neck mccoy we called him . runs a few protection rackets for carnello while he 's waiting for something bigger to come along . me and danny been friends since we were six . take a good look at that face , floyd , cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us , you 'll have to kill him and every other hood in chicago who 'd like to do the same thing . you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?
they staked out the other guy 's place last night , but he never showed . they figure maybe he skipped town . you wan na follow 'em up ?
hackers .
combs gave it to reilly and cole .
who 's got the contract ?
they 're still looking for him .
what about the other one ?
we got word from chicago . they got one of the grifters last night . the nigger .
all right , mark mottola up a little and put him on a bus . nothin ' fancy , just enough to keep him from coming back . get some local people to take care of the other two . we got ta discourage this kinda thing .
i do n't know . could be . we 're runnin ' that down now .
they workin ' for anybody ?
no , we checked his story with a tipster . he was cleaned by two grifters on 47th .
you sure he did n't just pocket it ?
mottola .
which one ?
it 's important . we had a little trouble in chicago today . one of our runners got hit for 12 grand .
i 'm busy , floyd .
doyle , can i see you a minute ?
all he 's got ta do is read .
does j.j. know how to use this thing ?
we bought ya a tap into moe anenberg 's wire . he 's got eyes at every track in the country . you 'll get race results , odds , scratches , pole positions , everything ; and just as fast as western union gets 'em .
just give us what ya can , benny . we 'll send a truck down .
you want the stuff tomorrow or do n't ya ? it 's gon na take hours just to clean it up . besides , gondorff 's still a hot item . where am i gon na be if he gets hit ?
c'mon , you can do better than that . we ai n't no heel grifters .
all right , i 'll rent ya everything i got in the warehouse for two grand . that 'll give ya phones , cages , blackboards and ticker gear . you supply the guys to move 'em . if you want a counter and bar , that 's another grand . i do n't know where the hell i 'm gon na get 'em though .
all we need is the bookie setup for now . we 'll worry about the telegraph office later .
been a while since i stocked a wire store . not many mobs playing that anymore .
got to . gondorff 's ridin ' the mark in from new york on the century .
i do n't know . this is kinda short notice . i 'm not sure we can get it all done by saturday .
looks all right . it 's big enough and off the street .
naw , i 'd just blow it .
you wanta wait for your share ?
you were right , henry . it 's not enough ... but it 's close .
you beat him , kid .
ai n't nothin ' gon na make up for luther , kid . revenge is for suckers . i been griftin ' 30 years and never got any .
i appreciate your stickin ' your neck out . i would n't have asked ya if it were n't for luther .
yeh .
henry .
seems worthwhile , does n't it ? maybe it 's just for the cave-in on lonnegan 's face when we put in the sting .
then why you doin ' it ?
i better do some packin ' . i 'm gon na be a hot number again after tomorrow .
two or three hundred i guess . sometimes played two a day when i was in shea 's mob . we had it down to a business . 'course chicago was a right town then . the fix was in . the dicks took their end without a beef . all the wall street boys wanted to make investments for us . even had marks looking us up , thinkin ' they could beat the game . yeh , kid , it really stunk . no sense in bein ' a grifter if it 's the same as bein ' a citizen .
how many guys you conned in your life , henry ?
take it easy , you wo n't lose him now . we had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody . believe me , i 've seen enough to know .
luther always told me to bite my toenails when i get nervous . you see yourself doin ' that and you realize it ai n't worth it .
just a little nervous , that 's all .
what 's the matter , kid ? you 're not sayin ' much .
christ , they 'll probably miss you and hit me .
a couple days ; that 's all i 'm askin ' . i can stay clear that long .
you just wo n't learn , will ya . hell , you come in here , i teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know , stuff most grifters could n't do even if they knew it , and all you wan na do is run down a bullet . you 're just like all them new jerks . lotsa nerve and no brains . and ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there wo n't be one gee left who knows the big con was anything more than a way to make a livin ' .
all we need is a couple days , henry . a couple days and we 'll get lonnegan down and stomp on 'em .
you know how easy it 'd be for one of lonnegan 's guys to nail you ?
you ca n't play your friends like marks , hooker .
it was too noisy .
then why 'd ya move outa your room ?
nothin ' . i told ya everything there is .
well you found him again and we 're gon na have to do somethin ' about it . what else have n't ya been tellin ' me ?
i thought i 'd lost him .
why did n't you tell me about snyder before ?
he 'll show .
no .
did he say he would n't ?
you think he 'll show ?
did he hold you up on anything ?
then he drove me home . he tried to put himself away as legit , so i went right into the pitch .
hell , they do n't do that and you know you 're not gettin ' through to 'em .
he threatened to kill me .
and ?
i gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to .
how 'bout lonnegan ?
no , not a thing .
you know , somebody tailin ' ya . a torpedo or somethin ' .
what do ya mean ?
no signs of trouble ?
yeh , it was easy .
everything go all right ?
well we got some workin ' money anyway .
how 'd ya do ?
if we ever get to it .
you just worry about your end , kid .
let him wait .
he 's waitin ' for you in the card room .
neither are we .
he 's not as tough as he 'd like to think .
if i can find a mob that 'll risk it . but no matter what happens , i do n't want you comin ' back to me halfway through and sayin ' it 's not enough ... cause it 's all you got .
then you 'll do it ?
right down to my socks , turkey . if i'da been half as scared a that lop-ear , i would n't a fallen asleep on 'em . lonnegan might kill me , but at least he wo n't bore me to death .
you 're sacred of 'em , are n't ya ?
you got ta keep lonnegan 's con , even after you spent his money . and no matter how much you take from his , he 'll get more .
i never played for winos .
this is n't like playin ' winos on the street . you got ta do more than outrun the guy .
we 'll get by without 'em .
you ca n't do it alone , ya know . it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good .
'cause i do n't know enough about killin ' to kill him .
why ?
i 'll take him anyway .
and a packing company , a chain of savings and loans and half the politicians in chicago and new york . there ai n't a fix in the world gon na cool him out if he blows on ya .
aw right , he runs the numbers outta the south side .
yeh , he croaked luther . what else do i got ta know .
you know anything about him ?
i wan na play for lonnegan .
you did n't act much like you wanted to learn it .
gondorff , you gon na teach me the big con or not ?
you never do , kid .
i do n't know . have n't seen anybody .
lonnegan after you , too ?
i picked something up on the way .
you gon na stay for breakfast , or do you already know how to eat ?
no , i lammed it around for a while while things cooled off . philly , denver , baltimore , nuthin ' towns .
he did n't tell me you was a fuck- up , either . you played the big con since then .
luther did n't tell me you had a big mouth .
you mean you blew it .
aw , i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal . a real lop-ear . he thought he was gon na take over general electric . some chantoozie woke him up , though , and he put the feds on me .
he had you down as a big-timer . what happened ?
i 'm sorry about luther . he was the best street worker i ever saw .
yeh , luther said you could teach me something . i already know how to drink .
glad to meet ya , kid . you 're a real horse 's ass .
i can talk , ca n't i ?
you sober ?
turn the goddamn thing off , will ya .
he wants to put a half million on syphon .
what 's the problem ?
if we 're lucky , this 'll bring him back stronger than ever .
looks like he 's sulking .
get a couple extra guys in the line , then . we 'll give him the shut-out .
not enough to cover a bet that big .
he 's gon na hit ya with 20 grand , eddie . how much cash we got ?
i also got ta win .
all you got ta do is show up with some money and look like a fool .
that 's why he wo n't know it .
the wire is ten years outa date .
we 'll use the wire . never known a gambler who would n't like to beat the ponies .
fancies himself a gambler , huh ?
the porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars . $ 100 minimum , straight poker . last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left new york .
wonder why he does n't fly both ways .
he 's been taking the 8:10 century limited outa new york on friday and getting in here early saturday morning . he usually stays a day to check on his policy operations , and then flies back .
nothin ' yet . i got a good one on the lead at hialeah , but he 's fadin ' .
how ya doin ' ?
that 's what i like about these guys , j.j ... they always got protection against things we 'd never do to 'em .
look at that . he 's got four apes with him .
nice work , j.j .
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza . i got you one of each . he likes to cold deck low , 8 's or 9 's .
yeh , i think so . i gave the kay- ducer a c-note . you find out the deck ?
you in ?
we 'll give him the hook on the train , and play him here . you think i can get in that poker game , eddie ?
i 'm not sure i know it .
everybody 'll sit still for somethin ' . what did ya find out about the train , eddie ?
lonnegan 's a fast egg , henry . he 's not gon na sit still for a standard play .
you 're more gutless than i thought .
a half mill on an eight to one shot . you 're dumber than i thought , lonnegan .
what are the odds on syphon ?
if ya win it could make ya , too .
i ca n't lay that off in time . we lose a bet that big , it could break us .
make sure you see cash from this guy , eddie . he 's got the name for bettin ' money he do n't have .
the name is lonnegan .
never get enough , huh pal ? i 'd think you 'd get tired of losin ' , honnigan .
what ! do n't give me that crap you little weenie . how do i know you ai n't gon na take a powder . you come to a game like this , you bring your money .
i guess i left it in my room .
raise 5,000 .
see and raise 1,000 .
raise 500 .
raise 1,000 .
pass .
raise 300 .
five and call .
see and raise five .
see ya and raise three .
raise 500 .
lonnegan .
yeh , that 'd be real nice of ya , mr. lonneman .
do n't have much choice , do ya ?
how do i know you 're tellin ' the truth .
gondorff asked me to look after ya .
who are you ?
too many people coulda seen ya go in her room . she was a professional . used to work in the dutch schultz gang .
she coulda killed me last night .
then you 'll have to come up with another grand somewhere .
my end was only one .
nobody can buy you a prayer , if i put the finger on ya .
i 'll square it with the fixer .
not intentionally maybe , but that do n't make no difference to lonnegan . he 'll swat you like any fly .
you 're crazy . i 'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money .
i 'll tell ya what you did , smart boy . you tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from maxies . you and coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th . if he had n't been a numbers runner for doyle lonnegan , it woulda been perfect .
aw , find yourself a shoplifter to roll .
you scored blood money today , hooker . you need a friend .
hi there , snyder . things a little slow down at the bunco department tonight , eh ? somebody lose the dominoes ?
think nothin ' of it .
thank you . you do n't know how much i appreciate this .
all right , i 'll give ya a break . down that hall there , there 's an unmarked door on the left . go on in there and wait at the window . i 'll take this ... ... in the back and run it through right away . we 'll have you outta there in a couple minutes .
i 'm sorry , really i am , but my train leaves in ten minutes .
we 'll get 'em ! give us a chance . i 'm not the only agent in here , ya know . we go around advertising ourselves , how many counterfeiters do you think we 'd catch , huh ? you think i 'm wearin ' this rag here 'cause i like it ? christ , everybody thinks life 's a holiday or somethin ' when you got a badge . i been here since three this morning , charlie , and i never knew there was so much ugliness in people . you try to help 'em and they spit on you . i shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin ' false notes .
but what about all these other people ?
it 'll only take 20 minutes or so . you can pick it up at the window down the hall .
but i got a train to make .
then i 'm afraid we 'll have to impound your money until we 're sure that it 's all good . can i see your wallet and your ticket , please ?
yes , a ticket to chicago .
we do n't doubt that , but there 's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station . have you made any purchases here today ?
what for ? i have n't done anything .
excuse me , sir . treasury dept ... i 'd like to ask you a few questions .
you know me . i 'm just like you ... it 's two in the morning and i do n't know nobody .
i do n't even know you .
if i expected somethin ' , i would n't be still standin ' out here in the hall .
and you expect me to come over , just like that .
i do n't mean nothin ' by it . i just do n't know many regular girls , that 's all .
you move right along , do n't ya .
i , ah ... thought you might wan na come out for a while . maybe have a drink or somethin ' .
yeh , this time anyway .
looks like he missed ya .
he 'd like to kill me .
what does this guy want ?
just do what i tell ya and everything 'll be jake .
what the hell for ?
all right , do me a favor . go into the bathroom , open the window and wait for me there .
no .
look , i do n't have time to fuck around . there 's somebody out there i do n't need to see . you got a fire escape or anything ?
no . what 's wrong with the front ?
you got a back door to this place ?
yeh , sleepin ' .
you doin ' anything tonight ?
2:00 a.m .
what time you get off work here ?
sixty-five .
meat loaf , apple pie and a cup of coffee .
i do n't know . depends what train i get on .
where you goin ' ?
she do n't work here no more . i 'm fillin ' in for a couple days ... till i can get a train outa here .
where 's june today ?
it is n't any better .
yeh , i guess i shoulda had the meat loaf .
you done ?
well we ca n't talk in here . they 're having the place painted .
i thought it might be good for him to see the setup .
what the hell 's the matter with you . we coulda met at a club or somethin ' .
les , i got mr. lonnegan with me . he wants to see you a second .
okay , tootsie .
tomorrow , after 4:00. stay inside , i 'll come in and get ya . and be hard on him for a while ; he 's talking money .
all right , when ?
twist ? i told him the tale . he wants to see ya .
no . they 're just the only ones we know of .
you sure it 'll be one of these two ?
three grand on the black , jimmy .
aw , come on , hooker , why do n't you just ...
i feel lucky tonight .
you sure you wan na start off that big ? bet like that could put a real dent in us .
you gon na have a go here ? how 'bout a ten spot on the line here . the 4-9 been lookin ' good today . lotsa action on 28th street down there , too . pay ya 10-1 .
naw , just a little hard times , that 's all . it 's all over now .
ai n't seen you in months , boy . thought maybe you took a fall .
how ya doin ' , jimmy .
hooker !
i do n't know , figure something out .
how am i gon na do that ?
tell your friend i 'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow . we 'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better . and make sure i can get to that window this time .
oh , jesus .
i did n't get the bet down in time .
what happened ?
he 's right , les .
a week 's a long time , friend . anything can happen . all of it bad .
had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th . she got me with her ring .
what happened to your face ?
you want your money back ? try and get it in a court of law . c'mon , do n't be a sorehead . i 'll make it worth your while . migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out .
no .
let me talk to him .
i got ta talk to me partner first . we ca n't afford to expose our game too much .
if your system 's as foolproof as you say , you 'll get even more .
what is this ? that 's my money . you tryin ' to muscle me ?
i think we oughta place another bet tomorrow .
not yet , but ... hey , there 's only a grand here .
you got the 400 grand yet ?
it 's foolproof . we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union . race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies . all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner . then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that 's already been run . it ca n't miss , unless the western union dicks get onto it .
i 'm in .
you stayin ' in or not ?
you got a system , carver ?
'cause it 's better to do it all at once . we 're puttin ' down 400 grand next week . at 5-1 we make 2 million . twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us .
why do n't ya then .
lucky , hell . i could do it every day .
you 're a lucky man , all right .
well , what did i tell ya ?
give 'em a little time .
you really picked a winner , kid .
i am after this race .
and you were gon na pay me back ?
this is just a test . the big one comes later . be careful with that though , it 's all i got .
you 're not gon na break him with a $ 2,000 bet .
sometime after 1:00 a guy 's gon na call here and give you the name of a horse . all you do is take this two grand across the street to shaw 's place and bet it on that pony . there 's nothin ' to it , but do n't take too much time . we only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call .
get on with it then .
i was afraid you were n't gon na come . we have n't got much time .
you should always look to the back too , kid .
if i 'm not there by quarter of , i 'm not coming .
660 marshall street . tomorrow at 12:30 , if you 're interested .
you 're dreamin ' , kid .
maybe a couple million .
that 's worth fifteen grand to ya ?
if you help me out , i 'll pay ya back the money you owe shaw , myself .
all you got ta do is place a bet for me at shaw 's place . i 'll supply all the money and the information .
i 'm a banker , friend . that 's legit in this state .
i need somebody respectable ... but not completely legit . what i 'm gon na do is n't very legal .
why me ? shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from .
all right , then .
naw , he picked up some jane in the bar . ca n't see him till morning anyway .
what 's the matter ? you got ta get back to shaw ?
cause i 'm tired of bein ' his nigger . i want you to help me break him .
then why the rat ?
so could shaw .
i could have you put under this train for this , errand boy .
you were set up , lonnegan . shaw 's been planning to beat your game for months . he was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya .
he hired a dame to take it from ya .
what do you mean ?
yeh , he knows that .
he 'll have to take a check . i could n't find my wallet .
he cheats .
your boss is quite a card player , carver . how does he do it ?
just as long as i get to finish the play .
all right , hooker , but you take it on the lam , and we 'll shoot you down on sight .
i mean completely played . until he 's beat and the score is taken . you come in before we beat him and i 'll kill him . you 'll have a tough time explaining that , wo n't ya .
hell yes . we do n't care about the mark . he deserves what he gets .
will you wait until the chump is played ?
like hell . you wo n't even get a review till you 're seventy . and if the board starts to go soft , we 'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who 'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin ' there later .
i 'll make parole .
you 've already done time twice , and judges do n't like three time losers . you wan na sit in the can for forty years , startin ' tonight ?
no .
look , i got nothin ' against you , but you 're in trouble here . all you got ta do is tell us when gondorff 's gon na play his chump . we come in at the sting , make the pinch , and you walk out free as a bird . no questions , no court appearance , nothing .
we 'll get it , and if we ca n't , we 'll just make it up . grand larceny , extortion . counterfeiting , anything you want .
you got nothin ' on me .
lt. snyder does n't know shit .
well give yourself a couple seconds , crumb . you would n't wan na lie to me . lt. snyder here says you done a lotta griftin ' in this town .
do n't think i know him .
we want to talk to ya about henry gondorff .
no .
you want a drink or something ?
on the nose ! i said place . place it on syphon . that horse is going to run second .
take it easy . everything 's all right . i put it on syphon , on the nose .
not if you want me to keep makin ' 'em for ya .
yeh , and what if we play tomorrow and he does n't come up with the money . we risk our whole operation for nothing . i 'll say when we make our bets .
with 20 % coming off the top for me laying your bet . either way you end up with 40 .
we were getting 50 from our guy .
if it works again tomorrow , i 'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day . we split 60-40 .
on a 6-1 shot ? the hell with ya . we 'll keep the deal we got .
i need more proof , that 's all . anybody can get lucky once .
but who says you will . i got a guy i can depend on . he 's liquidating everything he has for this . you would n't even give carver his money back .
i could come up with 750 grand in a day if i had a reason to .
ca n't do it . there 're telegraph inspectors all over the place . i got 750 grand coming in from the coast , and i 'm not gon na blow it for a lousy 14 gees . we 'll get somebody else to do our betting .
all right , get outa here . you 're outta work .
i do n't know . he took it hard .
yeh , and what does cole say about that ?
there was n't any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and did n't leave no footprints in the hall . somebody musta wised him up .
you were n't hired to miss him .
we missed him .
all right , riley . what the hell happened ?
never heard of the place .
this is the last time i expect to see you down here .
only rents by the month . two hundred and fifty for the two of them .
i 'll need a room over there that faces this way . how much a week ?
for fifteen years .
we 'll take it . you manage the building at the end of the alley ?
i think he will .
he 'll never do it .
he 's gon na set up gondorff for us .
what the hell good is hooker to ya ?
do n't crack wise to me , flatfoot . i spent a lotta time in dumps like this , eatin ' gondorff 's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin ' him off . but it 's not gon na happen this time . we 're not even gon na let the police know we 're here . if you keep your mouth shut and do a job , there 'll be a promotion in it for ya . and you better take it , cause i can make ya work for us without it .
would n't that be too bad . you 'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got .
cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin ' him . if word gets around that feds are in on it too , gondorff 'll fold up the whole thing .
why do n't you pick him up yourself ?
there 's word he 's gon na run a con on the north side here . we got a year-old florida warrant on him , but it 's a thin beef , and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold . all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us .
sure . every bunco man in the country knows gondorff .
well we do . he 's chummin ' around with a big c named henry gondorff . ring any bells ?
yeh , but i do n't know where he is .
do ya know him or do n't ya ?
sit down and shut up , will ya . try not to live up to all my expectations . we were told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker .
what is this ? i got work to do .
we 'll see you before you go .
right back to california . we 've got to go home and rest up from our vacation .
what 's your next step , nick ?
sorry . do n't know a thing .
what about this rosebreen ?
no .
have the police got any idea where wynant is ?
i never tried to kid you reporters -- i 'm telling you the truth .
come on , gim me a break .
sorry . i do n't know anything about it .
of course .
is that what it means ?
then just say he was sixty years old .
you know how they are ... sex ...
why not ?
sexogerarian , eh ? yes . yes . but i ca n't put that in the paper .
yes . he admitted it .
he was ?
there 's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father 's relationship with julia wolf that the police have overlooked . and i think it explains everything . you see , my father was a sexogenarian .
he 's just around the corner .
any luck ?
i ca n't find him . i 've tried everything . i thought you might know .
now do n't say that -- he 's just off somewhere working .
just a minute ...
what could happen to him , darling ? you must n't worry ... . what is it ?
he 's never forgotten a promise to me . i 'm worried about him . i know something 's happened to him .
he 's just forgotten . you know he forgets everything .
but tonight is christmas eve !
darling , your father 's all right . he 'll turn up in time .
it 's all right .
what 's the matter , darling ... not sweet enough ?
i 'm sorry .
cheer up , darling .
oh . i 'll do my own typing !
wel-l-l , it seems he has a secretary .
all settled ? grand ! why did your mother ever divorce him ? he 's swell .
look -- those are the first metals that came through .
i did n't know you invented that smelting process .
you better take a drink .
nothing .
what ?
do you suppose ... .. ?
said he stole his invention .
why did that man want to kill him ?
do n't start worrying about him . he 's a good guy , but screwy .
she 's got me worrying , too .
help yourself . oh , tom , show this gentleman ...
mind if i look around ?
and if it is n't ?
that is , if it 's all right with you .
well !
it 's the same one .
another young man .
how are you ?
oh , andy , andy !
darling , do n't cry . please . i know it 's terrible . but is n't it really better this way ?
why not ?
you 're high enough .
this is a pretty dead bunch , is n't it ?
go away !
dorothy ... . listen to me . i love you . do n't you understand that ? i love you .
why not ? i am crazy ... .the whole family 's crazy .
you 're talking like a crazy person ,
how would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children ? it 'd be fun , would n't it ? maybe they 'd murder each other ... keep it all in the family . that 's what father should have done . he should have killed me and gilbert ... then we would n't have had this to go through .
dorothy !
i ca n't marry you ! i ca n't ever marry you !
i only know i want to marry you ... right now , and --
you do n't understand . you do n't know what 's going to happen .
do you think i care
please ! you ca n't get mixed up in this .
what are you talking about ?
and do n't ever try to see me again .
go !
you 're sweet , but the only thing that you can do for me is to go .
you 've got to get your mind off this .
i ca n't .
darling , you ca n't go through any more of this . now you get together your clothes and your skates and we 'll go out to my family 's in the country .
i ca n't help it . you do n't know ... ..
do n't cry .
oh , andy .
and i 'll give then proof !
mother !
now do you believe me !
oh !
there !
i do n't believe it ! you 're lying !
i do n't think you will . it 's your father 's .
all right , then . i 'll tell them .
i 'll do nothing of the sort .
you hand that over to the police .
it 's a piece of evidence that 's worth a great deal more than that .
then what are you hiding ?
i did n't .
you took that money from julia 's hand .
nonsense ! she got at she deserved .
do n't . it 's horrible .
shush !
did it ever occur to you that chris might work ?
i did n't say i would . but we 've got to have money .
mother ... . you could n't do that . you could n't go to her .
i wo n't have you hounding him any more for money .
that 's gone long ago . i 've got to see him . where is he ?
you just want money -- and you have n't any right to any more . he made a big settlement on you .
no .
he 's all right . is n't that enough ?
that is n't true . it was about your father . where is he ?
nothing .
what is it ?
do you know where he 's living ? oh ... . well , at least i 'm glad he 's all right . thank you for calling . goodbye .
what is it ? has he found him ?
oh , here she is .
give it to me .
how are you ? ... . oh , i 'm mrs. jorgensen now ... . no , she is n't here . is it about her father ? well , can i take the message ?
what do you mean ?
he did n't do it -- nick !
tch-tch-tch -- well , goodbye , miss wynant . you would n't drive slowly , so you do n't get a tip .
he would n't say .
did he tell you where he was going ?
he 's waiting for you .
is your father still in there ?
thanks ... we 're taking your cab .
how are you ? here . get under this .
he 's been dead for three months .
dead ?
hello , nick ! and a party - celebrating father 's third murder -
hello , dorothy .
that 's the truth .
do n't lie to me .
i bought it in a pawn shop .
where did you get this gun ?
oh , yeah ? people fall toward a shot , you know ... not back from it . i knew you were lying .
she ... she fell over backwards .
which way did she fall ?
i do n't know .
did she make any sound ? did n't scream ?
she fell down .
pretty good shot you are . what did she do ?
why ... in the heart .
where did you hit her ?
yes . i hated her for coming between my mother and father . she kept me from seeing my father . i went down there to ask her where he was . she would n't tell me , and i shot her .
what are you trying to tell me ? that you did it ?
there .
yes .
you heard about julia wolf ?
i 've got to see you alone !
come on in .
oh , thank heaven .
i just wanted to relieve your mind . your father 's alive and all right .
thanks . we will . goodbye .
we 're at the normandie for a couple of weeks . why do n't you drop around ?
how do you do ? i 'm sorry we have to rush .
no . the lawyer -- i 'm going to see him .
your father ?
why do n't you try him again ?
tried him once -
that 's it ... herbert macaulay .
macaulay .
i do n't know anything -- i 've been in california for four years . what about his lawyer ? used to be a guy named mac -- something .
disappeared !
that 's what i was going to ask you . he 's disappeared !
yes . some nut who wanted to kill him . how is your father ?
andy ... this is nick charles . he worked on a case for father .
probably not .
was fascinated with you ... . a real live detective ... . you used to tell me the most wonderful stories . were they true ?
how did you ever remember me ?
yes .
not that scrawny little ... . ?
you do n't remember me ... .. i 'm dorothy wynant .
yes .
are n't you nick charles ?
of course we do ! we 've been friends for years .
you know , we know each other .
hello , there !
another martini --
goodbye , my boy . take care of dorothy . show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage .
goodbye , darling . do n't you dare forget ... december 30th .
better get home before it is .
but it is n't bad weather now .
only in bad weather .
poor dad , does that still bother you ?
he 's a brave man .
and he still wants to marry me !
like all the rest of us . has this fellow ... ... has he seen the whole family ?
you 're not missing much . he 's cuckoo .
i know -- i know --
you know how it is , dad . he 's sort of under mother 's thumb .
i 'd like to see him . why do n't you bring him down ?
he 's all right .
how 's your brother ?
that 's one thing i wo n't forget . where 's macaulay ? i ought to be starting .
it 's a promise ?
oh , i 'll be back before christmas .
we were planning to be married right after christmas .
yes . and i do n't want anybody to steal it from me .
a new invention ?
it 's a secret . i ca n't even tell you , my dear . i 've got an important idea to work on .
where are you going ?
wait a minute . when is it going to be ? i 'm leaving town tonight .
if you think it 'll be all right .
he can stay home . please , dad , wo n't you ?
would n't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather ?
this is my wedding .
what would your mother say to that ?
i hate all that fuss . but i 'll do it on one condition -- that you 're there to give me away .
yes , she would .
mother 's set her heart on a big church wedding .
dad , this is what i really wanted to ask you ... .
you see how much we have to say .
he 'll still be your son-in-law !
take a good look at him , dad . now please try to remember him ... 'cause he 's going to be your son- in-law .
forgive me . how are you ?
it 's been the same one for three months .
yes ... yes .
must have been in the war . that might account for the cane and his limp .
shrapnel !
i 'm very interested in that body .
not at all .
do you mind if i come down and see it ?
yes .
going to run him through the fluoroscope ?
you can take that out to the car .
know . but i saw him -
what are you talking about , gilbert ? you were n't there !
i saw him too ... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie ...
children , will you go into the next room ? i want to talk to chris alone .
well , i 've got my alibi . i was at the public library . where were you ?
i hope you wo n't talk that way to the police when they come here .
why not ? you had a perfectly good motive .
gilbert !
did you kill her ?
was there much blood ?
not a thing .
did they find any clues ... a gun or fingerprints or anything ?
she could tell you where father is .
that woman !
he said that father 's in town . he 's been seeing julia right along .
what is it , gilbert ? tell mother ! what did he say ?
you see , he 'd been very clever . everybody , even our astute friend guild , thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer . but our hero had just one weak link in his chain . the telegrams , wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant . so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case . mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is . mimi , who was it that told you to say you 'd seen wynant ?
shut up .
-- was wynant 's .
you mean that body -- -- - ?
because i found out for certain that he did n't commit the murders .
why did n't you tell me ? ... . why did n't you hold him ?
no .
are you kidding ?
i 'll take care of him .
what 're you doing here ?
just the same , wynant would n't mind having him out of the way , would he ? how long should you say this body 'd been here , doc ?
yes . but we figured it was just blackmail ...
he said wynant tried to steal an invention .
i never saw him . i do n't think anyone saw him .
could this be him ?
rosebreen .
`` d.w.r . '' that case you worked on ... the guy who threatened to kill wynant ... what what was his name ?
extraordinarily lucky .
lucky thing for us they were n't in that lime .
just rolled them up and threw them in .
this is enough for me .
fifty will still get you a hundred .
i guess that cinches it , eh , mr. charles ? he killed them both - julia wolf and nunheim .
she 's ready to talk . it wo n't do any harm , though - to find out where he is .
get anything ?
nunheim !
trail him ! trail who ?
i 'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him . i want to see where he goes .
who 're you calling ?
i think we 're on the right track .
well , what 'd you think ?
let 's go and see . taxi !
he 's holding out on you .
no .
did you know he was hanging around julia ?
oh , he 's all right . we know all about him . he does a little stooling for us every once in a while .
what about this nunheim ?
i 'll check on that . i 'm afraid this is kinder dull for you .
what about jorgensen ?
they 're all o.k . mrs. jorgensen , the boy , dorothy , macaulay ... even morelli ... we had to let him go .
i have n't got that far yet . but i do n't think that everything points to wynant . what about the alibis ?
who 's your candidate ?
for one thing , he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge .
what do you mean ?
fifty will get you a hundred that he did n't do it .
nothing yet to cinch it .
no proof ?
yeah . could n't find a thing . this is the way we figure it . wynant goes to julia 's apartment . he finds morelli there ... sees she 's two- timing him . they have a fight . but he figures he do n't want to do anything then ... . morelli might squeal . so he goes away . he do n't let his lawyer know anything has happened ... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him , so that julia will think it 's all blown over . then , when she do n't expect it ... he lets her have it .
you 've been there ?
i thought it might be . from now on , they 're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is wynant .
oh , that 's a phoney . the men did n't even have to go down .
what about the suicide ?
it 's a bargain then . anything you want to know ?
so would i .
man to man , i 'm not .
man to man , mr. charles , are you working on this case ?
that ai n't a gun any more . the firing pin 's busted - the - do n't waste time talking about that .
you mean about that gun ?
you ought n't to play this trick on me . running out when i was giving you time to rest up before i asked you those questions .
okay . there 's plenty of time . i guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on . we 'll come up tomorrow when you 're feeling better . come on .
i 'll have to try to remember .
who 's is it ?
no .
this gun yours ?
ever heard of the sullivan act ?
no .
have you got a pistol permit ?
so you say - go on , bob .
not without a warrant .
keep on asking .
i 'm asking you .
ask him . i do n't know .
what 'd he think it was to you ?
nothing .
what 's that to you ?
wanted to tell me he did n't kill julia wolf .
what 's he want of you ?
i never saw him before .
we were looking for this bird .
yes . i might not have been shot .
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family , so we figure we 'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up . then we seen him ... ... sneak in and we decide to come up . and pretty lucky for you .
how 'd you people happen to pop in ?
well , thanks . we 'll call you when we need you again .
i did n't know they had a fight .
do you know what they fought about that night he went away ?
i know he 'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers . you ca n't think he had anything to do with it , mr. guild . he was n't the kind of man that ... .
yes . but he did n't show up .
did you go ?
about three .
when was that ?
i was n't in . my secretary took the message . he left word for me to meet him at the plaza .
he did !
he telephoned me today .
well , what ?
well ... .
oh , then you did hear from him ?
i said he had n't written me .
seen any signs of it , bill ?
yesterday . i gave her a thousand dollars .
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant ?
let him have his say out .
that 's ridiculous .
tell 'em .
a brown suit , brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red , or reddish brown figures on it .
what kind of clothes was he wearing ?
that 's nothing . i saw him myself .
you did !
goodbye .
goodbye .
that 's all right . well , we 'll be going .
the medical examiner seems to think that the body was touched . he says it looks as if the girl 's hand had been forced open after she was killed ... .
i do n't think so . of course i was terribly upset ... i hardly knew what i was doing .
are you sure you did n't leave the room ... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone ?
no .
did you see anything in miss wolfe 's hand ?
why yes .
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came ?
i see .
there are a few things we want to check up on .
you 're a great help to a hostess . i wish i always had you for my dinner parties .
they 'll be here . do n't worry . my men are picking them up .
mr. guild means guests ! oh , there are two more to come .
i guess all the suspects are here .
i think we may as well sit down .
looks like he planned , something . he shut up his apartment and his shop .
do you think that wynant did it ?
i do n't mind telling you i 'd rather have you working with us than against us .
but he 's interested !
good morning , lieutenant - sorry .
good morning --
just give me a minute ... . i 'll remember . i 'm not stalling , lieutenant . you know i always come clean with you . gee , it 'd serve me right if you had pinched me ... that 's the afternoon i was ... . wait , i 'll show you ... !
how 'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering ?
i ca n't remember offhand , lieutenant . maybe i was over at charlie 's shooting pool . maybe i was here . she 'd remember .
sit down ! we did n't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a may pole . where were you the afternoon the girl was killed ?
let me go ! let me bring her back . i ca n't get along without her . i 'll bring her right back and i 'll tell you anything you want to know . let me go !
marian ! marian ! do n't go ! i 'll behave ! i 'll do anything ! do n't go , marian !
where were you ?
where were you ?
you do n't think i had anything to do with it ?
you 'd done better to have told me that in the beginning . where were you the afternoon she was knocked off ?
i did n't mean you , mister .
want to take a poke at him ?
that 's a lie , lieutenant ... anybody that says that is a liar .
maybe if you quit running around after other women you would n't have so much trouble with this one .
she drives me nuts . she 's been ragging me all day .
that 's all i did , lieutenant . that 's the god 's truth . maybe i said hello to her or how are you or something like that when i saw her , but that 's all i knew her . that 's the truth . all right . put your mouth in and i 'll pop a tooth out of it .
what 's the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight ?
have a shot ?
never mind .
why , you said ...
i thought you said you were n't going there .
and there she was lying dead . the police said she 'd probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there .
chris -- chris -- !
would n't i. just watch me .
you would n't do that ... you would n't !
just what i said i 'd do .
what are you going to do ?
i said all right !
i could n't go near that woman .
all right . all right .
chris !
why do n't you go to see julia ? she handles his money .
i know .
you 've said that for weeks .
i 'll get some .
how can i help but mind ? i 'm constantly humiliated ... just because i have n't money .
do n't mind what she says , chris .
then someone was in with you . who was it ? -- who was it ? i 'll answer that -- hello ... hello ...
i never had it .
what did you do with the rest ?
i ca n't ! i have n't got it !
you 're going to return every cent of it !
i 'll give it back to you ... . all i 've got ... .twenty-five thousand ...
hello ... . give me ... . well ... . ?
that 's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i 've been to you ... .
they 'll be pretty rough with you ... .with your record .
go ahead !
i want that money right now , or i 'll hand you over to the police .
supporting that gang of loafers ! there 's not one of them that cares a damn for you . a wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped . they would n't raise a hand to help you . and i 've given my whole life for you . if you kicked off tomorrow , where 'd i be ? out in the gutter ! sure i took those bonds . who has a better right -- ?
that 's my business .
what if i did take them ? i 'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours ... .
no one else had the combination of that safe . you took them . what did you do with them ?
do you realize that you 're accusing me of ... .
now see here , julia . you 're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded . you 've been taking a little here and there for some time , and i have n't said anything about it . but this is fifty thousand dollars !
do n't you remember ... .
i 'd never tell you to sell those . i bought them for my daughter .
oh yes . why , you told me to sell them a long time ago .
the government bonds . the ones you took from the office safe .
what bonds ?
no . i just came back for a second . i wanted to get those bonds .
do n't worry . you wo n't see him again . what happened ? did you change your mind about going ?
i do n't like him .
this is the first time i 've seen him in years . i did n't want him to think i was high-hatting him .
i thought you 'd given up that sort of friend .
he 's not anybody . just a fellow i used to know .
who 's that man ?
so i see .
we 're just having a little drink .
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you ?
oh , please , nick .
so did we . i mean , sherlock here .
i got word from wynant this morning ...
that 's all right .
asta - do n't bother mr. macaulay .
good .
oh , he 's sitting up .
good morning . i 'm afraid this is n't a very `` merry christmas '' for you .
oh , hello . come on in .
yes ?
is there a mr. macaulay in the house ? oh , it 's you .
i left instructions with julia . she 'll get it from you . goodbye .
but what if you need more money ?
no .
is julia going with you ?
settle it yourself . what have i got a lawyer for ?
what 'll i do if something comes up ?
thanks , and goodbye .
you might do that . get me a ticket for ... no , you do n't !
well , let me do that for you .
no .
is n't there anything else i can do for you ? have you bought your ticket ?
i trust you .
i wish you 'd count them . there 's a thousand dollars there .
never mind .
one hundred ... two hundred ... three ...
that 's just why i 'm going .
but suppose some business comes up ...
i 'm not telling anyone .
i do wish you 'd tell me where you 're going .
did you get my money ?
what about it , tanner . is n't that the truth ?
i have no right to answer that .
oh he as clever about that . he called when you were out . that same afternoon , julia telephoned to him . she said that you were coming , mimi , to ask about wynant . he got terrified . he was afraid that julia would break down and tell ... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant 's watch chain in her hand .
but it must have been wynant . i should have known if it were n't his voice .
hello ... . where ? in allentown . yes ... when is the next train ? right - i 'll get that . wynant 's tried to commit suicide . they want me to come down and identify him . i guess this changes the whole story , does n't it ? that looks like an admission of guilt . and i had such hopes . i thought if you got on the case , you 'd be able to clear him . i thought that mimi ... . the way she acted ... i was sure that ... . oh , well , well ... it 's no use thinking of it now . i 'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time .
hello ... . oh , just a minute . police department ?
i 've done that already . he should appear , you know . it does n't look well ... his staying away at a time like this .
it would n't hurt to put it in .
he gave me a code message to insert in the times , in case i wanted to get in touch with him .
it might .
slim .
what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants ?
that 's all right .
i hate to bother you when you 're laid up .
how are you ?
s'long .
how do you do ? what did you say ? ... . he is ? ... . where is he ? very well . he 's back in town ... . wynant . thank heaven . he 's waiting for me now . forgive me , mrs. charles ... but i 've been so upset . it 's no joke working for a man like that . i must be off . goodbye ... . goodbye ,
my wife .
he sends word through julia wolf when he wants money ... i give it to her and she gives it to him .
no word at all ?
you know as much about it as i do . i have n't seen him in three months .
what 's all the fuss about ? is he in hiding ?
i see . i see .
my wife 's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things . and i 'm looking after them .
you do n't say --
i have n't been a detective for four years .
she usually is . trying one way or another to get money out of wynant . i wanted to find out if you were er - er - -- sleuthing for her .
mimi ? ... oh , dorothy 's mother . does she have to be up to something ?
nothing , thank you . nothing . i wanted to see you ... what 's mimi up to , charles ?
that 's all right . what are you drinking ?
dorothy told me you were here . i was going to telephone but ... .
hello , macaulay . come in .
how are you ?
macaulay , you drew up wynant 's will . mimi was cut off , was n't she , if she re-married ?
i 'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
you 're lying , mimi . but then , you 'd do anything for money . you 're getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you wo n't get anything if he 's dead .
it is n't a story - it 's true . i did see wynant . he 's not dead .
what did he pay you , mimi , to stick to that story ?
nobody told me . i did see him !
and the murderer is right here in this room tonight ... he 's sitting at this table . you may serve the fish .
perfectly absurd .
so i did . i saw him lying buried in his shop .
because i do n't believe that clyde 's dead ! why , you said yourself you saw him last night .
he did n't say very much . wanted to know how i was and how the children were .
oh , did he ? what did he say ?
last night . he came to see me at my apartment .
you did ... where ?
i 've got some very important news - i 've seen wynant .
this is all very pleasant but why are here ?
all right , then -- i 'll tell them who did do it !
they 'll want more than your word for that .
i tell you -- he did n't do it .
that 's not for you to decide . everybody 's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- the police will want his description . is this a picture of him ?
but he has nothing to do with it !
you should have told them he 'd disappeared .
chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- i do n't see that it 's important --
gilbert ! is he here too ? we might as well be living in the lobby .
where 's gilbert ?
yes ...
dorothy ! is she here ?
i tell you again , i do n't want any part of it . now you take dorothy home and ...
but he knows you . all you have to do is get in touch with him , and tell him that mimi says everything is all right ... but that i 've got to see him .
now , mimi , there are a thousand detectives in new york . hire one of them .
nick , you will help me find clyde -- wo n't you ?
you 're always teasing .
well , do n't you ?
oh , i know he did n't , but i wish i could find him ... i have something very important to tell him . macaulay wo n't help at all . he thinks i just want money .
what do you think ?
clyde wynant 's crazy ... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this . no wonder the police think he has something to do with it .
want to talk to you about something very important .
hello , mimi .
oh , nick ... nick !
i hope you wo n't let this news spoil your dinner . nice food , is n't it ?
what am i ? the fall guy ?
thank you . now i 'll tell you why i know wynant did n't commit those murders - three months ago - the night that he caught you in julia 's apartment , he found out that julia was cheating him , and was splitting with some man . he went to find the man . that man was ... . tanner , do n't you ... ?
once i wanted five grand -- cash -
why do you say that ?
she do n't say she is , but i figure she is -
morelli - you knew julia . was she gypping wynant ?
this is your party .
what 's that ?
i am on the level . if i knew anything i 'd ... .
that 'd be very smart . that 'd be the smartest thing i ever did . me that a police captain 's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument . the boys would like to have me come in and ask questions . they 'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks . now i come to you on the level . studsy says you 're on the level . be on the level .
i 'd tell you if i knew . but i 'm not in this . ask the police .
he 's all right . he 'd like to see you . but listen ... what 's the law doing to me ? do they think i did it , or is it just something else to pin on me ?
how is studsy ? i did n't know he was out of stir .
listen . `` studsy '' burke told me you used to be o.k . that 's why i 'm here . do they ... .
that 's all swell . only you 're peddling your fish in the wrong market . i 've got nothing to do with it .
i would n't have any reason to hurt her . she was always on the up and up with me . but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he did n't , so he put the finger on me .
why tell me ?
i have n't seen her in three months . we were all washed up .
all right - you did n't .
i did n't knock julia off .
i 've never heard about you .
do you mind putting that gun away ? my wife does n't care , but i 'm in a delicate condition .
i got ta talk to you . i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight . get me ?
his plan was still working beautifully . wynant was established as being in town . the watch chain was handed over ... . ... with a slight delay ... to the police . the only hitch was a man named nunheim who had found out something . our hero paid nunheim once to keep his mouth shut , and when nunheim threatened him again , he bumped him off .
i hope you 're well .
it 's the only way it makes sense .
why are you saying it ?
i do n't know .
is that true ?
after our hero had killed wynant , he got a brilliant idea . he realized that he and julia could still collect money . wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay , signing wynant 's name , so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia . he even telephoned macaulay -- do you remember ? ... . the first day that you came to see me ... he telephoned that he was in town ?
if that knife is missing , i 'll look for it in your back .
let 's see ... where was i ? oh , yes . he went to find the man . that man was desperate ! he knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face , he took the only way out . he killed wynant . it 's terrible to tell you this way but your father 's dead , dorothy .
you 're going to drive me crazy !
i 'm afraid you 're lying , mimi . you see , i really did see wynant last night .
serve the nuts - i mean , serve the guests the nuts .
i wish you 'd tell me .
i wish you 'd tell me who .
yes .
i ca n't wait any longer . tell me , do you think one of them did it ?
thank you , mrs. charles .
you give such charming parties , mr. charles .
mimi , jorgensen , morelli , tanner ... ..
mimi !
mimi ...
who do you think did it ?
oh , they 'll come . i 'll have guild issue the invitations .
the suspects ! they wo n't come .
i 'm going to give a party , and invite all of the suspects .
i 've got a lulu -- why ?
got a nice evening dress ?
now nick , what 's that got to do with it ?
got a nice evening dress ?
yes !
i 'm going to get the real murderer . i 've got an idea . want to see me take him ?
what are you going to do ?
i want to lie low till i get the whole dope . i do n't want to go off half-cocked .
why not ?
i ca n't help it . i ca n't tell a soul . i did n't even tell guild .
but the poor kid 's going crazy . she 'd rather know her father was dead than that ...
hey ... hey . do n't do that .
i 'm going to tell her .
no . nobody but you .
wynant dead ? does dorothy know ?
smart gal .
then he could n't have committed those other murders .
couple of months anyway .
how long has he been dead ?
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin . it often bothered him . so i looked for it and i found it . gim me .
you do n't get another swallow 'til you really open up .
sure .
well , do n't they ?
oh . well , the clothes for instance . they were carefully preserved , and the body was just as carefully destroyed . the person who killed him counted on one thing ... that all skeletons look alike .
what things made you so sure ?
huh ?
nick , you 'll drive me crazy . what things ?
several things . hello , fred . we 're hungry again . yeah , and lots of onions . oh , and coffee .
what makes you so sure it 's wynant 's body ?
that 's what they think ... guild and all of them . they take it for granted that it 's just another of wynant 's victims . guild 's hot-footing it around now , looking for wynant . that 's all that troubles him .
but they all said it was rosebreen 's .
yup . do n't you want something to eat ?
wynant 's body ?
that 's a fact .
nick , you 'd better lay off that liquor .
it was his body that was buried there .
nick !
he was down in the shop .
what do you mean ?
i did find him !
i want you to stay and find wynant .
my soul , woman . i give you three murders and you are n't satisfied .
back to california
i do n't care - i 'm just used to you , that 's all -- if you let anything happen to him , you 'll never wag that tail again !
why , i believe the little woman cares .
do n't say it that way . say it as if you meant it .
sure i will .
nickie , take care of yourself wo n't you ?
goodbye , darling .
you dog !
not with all your money !
you bet i would n't .
you would n't be a widow long .
go on - go on - see if i care . but it 's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow .
i 'll be all right . i 've got asta to protect me .
i know but this is different . he 's a crazy man . he might kill you .
say you 're the one who got me in this !
nick - i wo n't have you going down there .
i do n't know ... this thing has got my goat . i 've got to find out .
you mean , he might be hiding there ?
he went away lots of times when i knew him - but he never closed his shop . i 've got a hunch something is up .
why should n't be close it ? he went away .
i 've got hunch . i 'm going down to look at wynant 's shop , i want to find out why it 's closed .
what are you going to do ?
looks like a hold-up !
what 's that ? what are you up to ? nickie - what is this ?
we 're going sightseeing -- are n't we , asta ?
he 's just been for a walk .
i 'm going to take asta for a walk .
i wish they 'd stop that . it makes me fidgety . do you think they 'll find him , nick ? he must be in new york ... . where do you think you 're going ?
catch me letting you go alone !
this may be a little rough - you 'd better let us go alone .
come on , watson , we 're going places .
so am i .
no reason . just a hunch . but i 'm going to find out . i 'm tired of being pushed around .
why do n't you ?
i do n't believe he did it .
but wynant -- - ?
maybe i will .
the mystery 's all gone . and i wanted you to find out who did it .
what 's the matter with you ?
what 's the trouble , asta ? your balloon busted ? so 's mine .
all right , hard guy . get up and bleed on the rugs .
you talk as if i were asta .
sit down !
it 's not going to hurt me to get up .
well , that 's that . stay there , nick !
yes . it 's asta 's christmas present .
oh , it 's a fire hydrant .
oh take it ! please take it !
your guess is as good as mine .
he would n't ask you to handle it if he were guilty .
i do n't know .
philadelphia . then he did n't do it , did he , nick ?
let 's see . where 's it from ?
nick , listen . from clyde wynant ! `` will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder . communicate with herbert macaulay '' .
yes .
did i give it to you ?
yes .
is that another christmas present ?
i 'm stifling , but it 's so pretty . the kirbys .
are n't you hot in that ?
macaulay .
who 's that ?
hello ... send him up .
that 's not true . he never came near my tabloids . that 's one thing i always protect ... my tabloids .
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids .
yes . i know all they know about the murder . and i 'm a great hero . the tribune said i was shot twice .
finished with these ?
you must admit i have good taste .
you did .
who gave it to you ?
no . it 's a christmas present .
i never saw that before .
well , did n't you ?
on it ! i 'm in it ... they think i did it !
he 's got more sense than you have . thank heaven you 're not on this case .
you 're a fine watch dog .
he 'll be here . give him time to get his trousers on . where 's asta ? asta ! asta !
i wish that doctor 'd come . how do you feel ?
yeah .
want a drink ?
i 'll be all right . do n't let 's fuss till the doctor comes .
i 'll get some towels .
sure -- i do n't even feel it .
well , quick -- get into bed . are you all right ?
there 's one coming .
someone get a doctor .
it 's all right . it just grazed me .
all right ... shoot ! i mean ... what 's on your mind ?
you idiot ! asta ! stop that ! get down ! now , stay there .
that 's great . i was afraid i 'd have to go to sleep .
nick ! nick ! there 's someone to she you ,
you 'll have to keep them anyway . the man at the aquarium said that he would n't take them back .
what are you going to give me ? i hope i do n't like it .
breakfast .
but it 's christmas now .
at breakfast .
i think i would like that drink . i 'll give you your christmas present now if you 'll give me mine .
darling , my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it . and the police 'll catch him without my help .
she thinks you can . it would n't hurt you to find out if you could , would it ?
there 's nothing i can do to help her .
that poor girl is in a tough spot .
tomorrow i 'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories .
i 'd like to see you work .
they were kidding you .
everybody says you were a grand detective .
maybe it would if i took it .
no thanks .
maybe a drink would help you .
no .
ca n't you get to sleep ?
do n't you think you 'd like to go back to detecting once in a while , just for the fun of it ?
that 's jolly .
good . i want to talk to you .
yes .
nick ! nick ! are you asleep ?
too bad you did n't bring your whip .
she did n't tell me a thing .
nothing , 'til i find out if it 's the gun julia wolf was killed with . keep her in here , and do n't let those reporters see her . they might believe her .
what are you going to do with it ?
she brought it in . trying to make me believe she did it .
where did you get that ?
rye .
what are you drinking ?
is n't that my drink ?
i wonder if they 've -- i do n't want to hear anything about it .
sounds like a good case . girl mysteriously murdered . no one knows who did it . they have n't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
room service , please -
i have n't the time . i 'm much too busy seeing that you do n't lose any of the money i married you for .
i 'd better order some food . that sounds like an interesting case . would n't you like to take it ?
we need ice .
come on -- relax -- give them a drink .
santa claus .
who 's that ?
take it easy .
i ca n't lie here . i 've got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree .
that last martini .
what hit me ?
six martinis . you 're not going to have anything on me .
six martinis .
how many drinks have you had ?
much better , thanks .
by the way , how is your father 's side ?
i was hoping i would n't have to tell you . dorothy is really my daughter . you see , it was spring in venice , and i was so young . i did n't know what i was doing . we were all like that on my father 's side .
who is she ?
only you , darling ... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws .
you got types ?
if you like 'em like that .
pretty girl .
as long as there is n't a fire hydrant . what i 've gone through --
he 's well-trained . he 'll behave himself .
you might have mentioned me first .
oh , this is andy --
i thought so . he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen 's --
i had him out this morning .
he 's dragged me into every gin mill on the block .
hello , baby .
so it 's you he was after !
you should n't let that keep you from telling truth , mimi . mrs. jorgensen - were you ever divorced from chris jorgensen ?
that 's what mr. wynant said to me . if she re-married , all the money was to go to the children .
no ... no .
i 'm sorry . tanner , do n't you want some wine ?
police !
you can save that and tell it to the police . they 'll be here in a minute .
mr. charles - she did - that 's why he got sore at her and killed her . listen , mr. charles -- i did do a little chiseling . i come to bring it back and fix up the books . i did n't want him to find out and come after me -
trying to put it off on her ?
honest , mr , charles . i never touched that safe . them bonds that were missing ... julia took them .
somewhere 's where they might go out and leave the safe open ?
that time you sent me up last ... i learned book-keeping at sing sing . i figured it might be an in for me somewhere 's .
well , that 's a hot one . you a bookkeeper ! when were you ever a bookkeeper ?
yes , sir . julia wolf got me a job as bookkeeper .
you worked here ?
i had a key . i worked here ... till they closed the shop .
how did you get in here ?
no , mr. charles .
come on out , now . he wo n't hurt you . back to your old tricks , eh , tanner ?
i would n't know . that time he caught me was a accident . i led with my right .
was he a good detective ?
he 's a good guy . he sent me up the river once . hey , nick !
yes .
you his wife ?
yes . nick !
nick charles here ?
oh , yes -- yes -- that 's right --
you 're forgetting the check for your suitcase . it 's at the grand central .
maybe she has .
maybe miss wolf has them .
i know i left them there .
bonds , sir ?
i 'm going to give her a wedding present . thought i 'd better do it now , before i forget it . i can drop them on my way to ... that 's funny ... . where are those bonds ?
well , congratulations .
you did .
who fired you ?
i 'm fired .
home ?
home !
where are you going ?
i do n't care what you wanted to tell me . you 're through ! get your things and get out !
i just wanted to tell you ...
two weeks work gone for nothing .
i 'm sorry ... but ...
nobody 's going to hurt you .
please , i beg of you . the american army is there . i am iraqi . they will kill me .
turn the car around .
this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
what 's in the other direction ?
baghdad .
where were you going ?
y-yes .
you speak english ? do you speak english ! ?
it 's like i said ; you do n't really know lieutenant john epps very well , do you ?
looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who 's better than who , do n't we , epps ? like i said ; i expected more from you .
if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
give it to me !
if i do n't answer , he 'll know something 's up .
so you can give us away ?
i have to answer him .
just keep quiet .
you do n't know john epps very well , do you ?
they 'll kill you . you wo n't make it ten feet before they cut you down .
that 's just what things came to . sometimes you ca n't help that . it does n't change me respecting you . and now you let me down . i expected more from you , you know ? i really did . i expected you to --
that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert .
you disappoint me , epps . always figured you to be a man ; a real bright guy . i had respect for you .
tell me something , wes . are you crazy , greedy , or just stupid ? jaeger says you 're crazy .
thanks for taking care of this for me .
look , i know you guys are telling the truth . it 's just the shi'ites do n't know that . i guess you could tell them ... but then you do n't speak the language do you ?
wes --
sure , and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with .
wes , we thought you were dead , and we thought we were next . hanging around to get killed would n't have done anyone any good .
we thought --
in the flack jacket . still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat . took the air right out of me , but i was just unconscious for awhile . 'course , you did n't stick around to find that out . you left me for dead .
nothing about him , unless he 's got a problem about me dealing with you .
what about jaeger ?
then i suppose it 'd be insurrection , and i suppose i 'd have to kill you . i suppose .
suppose i do n't go for that ?
i 'm the one 's got the big stick .
and let me guess who is .
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge .
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand .
no navicom . a lot of good you are now , epps .
what if i do ?
we been down this road . i told you how it is . unless you feel like there 's something you want to do about it ...
in the service you do , but we 're not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we 're doing , that does n't particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
i out rank you , that 's why .
you 've got an awful lot of orders in you . always giving orders .
get out of my way .
no .
then step aside .
it 's murder , and i wo n't be any part of it .
it 's a combat action .
i 've got no stomach for murder .
i 'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around . i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you do n't have the stomach to do what has to be done .
he tried to kill us . if not just now , then in the helicopter . that 's all the authority i need .
we are not at war ! you and i and jaeger are awol . we have no authority --
we 're at war .
i 'm not going to let you kill him .
he 's an enemy soldier .
you 're out of your mind .
you do n't know he is n't .
you do n't know that .
that 's what he says . he could be a spy , or something .
you said he was a deserter .
we ca n't just leave him . he 'll run back to his outfit , report our position ...
does n't matter . whatever he wanted he did n't get it . we 've got no need staying around here . it 's light enough . let 's pack up and head out .
i do n't care what he says , he wanted our gold . would have slit our throats if he had the chance .
he ... he could have been watching us .
how 's he going to want the gold ? he could n't even know we had it .
says he wanted food . liar . he wanted the gold .
why 'd he come in our camp .
says they were deserters , they were afraid to fight , do n't believe in saddam anyway . they flew the gunship up here to hide out . when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them , so they shot first .
i told you ; do n't push me around .
stop it !
i told you . he tried to steal our gold . he tried to kill us .
what happened ?
get off him !
he snuck in here thinking we were asleep , only i was n't sleeping . would have slit our throats if i had n't stopped him .
get off him .
then get up and do something about it .
you got no reason to hit me . i 'm getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around .
i told you : when i straighten someone out they stay straightened . this is how it works : nobody touches the gold . except when we 're on the move and someone 's carrying it , nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it . agreed ?
you got no reason to do that !
maybe i do n't need your ideas . maybe i can do better on my own .
maybe i do .
maybe you 've got ideas of your own for the gold . maybe you 've already got things worked out .
you 've had your say , wes . now leave it .
you 're the one with all the ideas .
what if we get separated ? way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share .
we started this together , and we 're staying together , so there 's no point in splitting things up now .
maybe we should split it up now .
what about it ?
what about the gold ?
it 'll be too dark to make our way back now . let 's bed down for the night and head out at first light .
all right . i 'll go up , then you send up the gold and --
you ready ?
ready when you are .
i do n't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins . wes ! ? we 'll send the gold up , then me and jaeger 'll climb back .
i heard !
epps !
got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up . does n't hurt to have a look out either .
what am i supposed to do ?
all right . let 's break out some utility shovels , lanterns , and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting . me and jaeger 'll climb down , and see what we can see .
move !
missile !
so we wait .
and they ca n't fly around out there forever .
weird they did n't chase us .
i do n't know . there 's a lot of space up here . they could be just about --
where 'd they go ?
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i do n't think it 'll be too hard to --
otherwise whatever we 're looking for could be anywhere .
got to be some kind of landmark ; something distinctive .
what do you figure it to be ?
should be easy going from here . stay on the pass straight to the dot .
let me see the map .
the us army : always an adventure .
picks up again just on the other side .
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here . worn down to nothing now .
not much of a pass .
we 're not going to find anything standing here . let 's get to climbing .
and find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the humvee , and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off , but that 's about it .
all we 've got to do is make it to the top .
there 's nothing we can do . we should n't even be here in the first place .
we ca n't just go off and --
i do n't want to see people killed any more than you . but we try to help out we die , and all we do is die .
we can fight . that 's what we 're here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the shi'ites , and the khurds .
there 's nothing we can do .
the soldiers are going to kill those people !
all right . let 's get out of here .
yeah .
ready ?
should have at least gotten the map off of him . blows up with him then we did all this for nothing .
you just go when i say go .
what if it 's a valloro 69 ? just going to bounce right up out of the ground , explode in the air , kill him and us .
break it out .
for climbing .
we 've got rope ?
maybe that 's all the iraqis could afford , okay ? maybe they got it on discount . maybe the fuse is messed up . or maybe it 's going to go off in two seconds , and we wo n't have to worry about getting jaeger down off there , all we 'll have to worry about is finding the pieces .
should have blown already . delayed fuse , that 's vietnam stuff .
i do n't know , and i was n't about to mess with it .
what kind of mine ?
how tough you have to be to make the army ? all you 've got to do is shoot a gun , and stop a bullet .
he 's an idiot , and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks .
he 's not so --
not much chance of that . jaeger 's an idiot .
maybe we are crazy for doing this . but if we do it , we do it right . i just needed to explain that in a way i would n't have to do it again .
him getting us stranded out here does n't do much good either .
you two fighting 's not going to get us anything .
low on gas . got to refill .
what are you doing .
they should n't have been out this way , that 's all i 'm saying .
deserters would have run , they would n't have engaged .
this is miles from the battle lines . they were probably deserters .
we should n't have been here , epps . there is a war going on !
they should n't have been here .
oh , jesus , they 've stopped .
wha ...
they stopped .
we 're going to keep driving .
what are we going to do ! ?
no , please , not again .
why , yes , jaeger . i believe it is .
i 'd settle for being alive . really . alive would be fine .
i know you think this is crazy , but a couple of hours from now you 're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there .
what ?
oh , god .
yeah ! welcome to beautiful iraq . land of enchantment and riches .
i 'm thinking about when this war is over . why you figure i 'm here ? 'cause i got tired of being president of gm ? if a brother does n't play ball , or deal drugs there are n't too many big money prospects around , and i 'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies ' wars . so i say if maybe there 's something out there , what the hell , that 's what i say .
you 're out of your minds , you know that ? both of you . you do n't even know if there 's anything out there . what the hell are you thinking ?
better grab up some sand to take home to your family .
damn , this is sweet . we are going to be home in no time .
a casual one .
there you go , jaeger . just find the buried treasure , and you 're a millionaire .
it 's a map , i think that 's what it is .
help , i 'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory .
what 's it say ?
it 's a fortune box .
paper .
can you eat it ? if you ca n't eat it i really do n't care what it is .
well , based on my knowledge of the region , its culture and her people i would have to say it 's a box .
i did n't learn arabic because we were getting shipped here . you do n't learn it in a couple of weeks . i studied it in high school .
like learning arabic ? you 're gon na learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here .
you know so much about the middle east , you know where we can get something to eat .
... and it 's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone . it 's considered offensive .
not up to us . up to the iraqis . all they have to do is get out of kuwait .
think we 're going to do it ? think we 're going to war ?
he 's going to slow down .
he 's not slowing .
he 'll slow down .
epps , i do n't think he 's slowing down .
we 'll make up some kind of lie . they wo n't find the gold .
well , this is it . we get the car , find some americans . we find americans we 'll be all right .
that 's what i hear . do n't matter . girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .
really ?
i 'd go to australia . lot of land , not many people . i think after this i 'd like to quit people for awhile . and the girls go crazy for brothers down there .
what ?
australia .
how the hell should i know ?
i 've never been anywhere . i would n't know where to go . where would you go ?
i do n't know .
still am . there 's more gold than i thought , and since there 's only two of us now ... where should i go ?
thought you were going to buy a car .
i 'm thinking about taking a trip .
what ?
epps ?
do n't make so much out of it . only reason i have n't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i 've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive . believe me ; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had . i 'm no better than anybody else . i 've just been busier .
yeah . even after that . you did n't take it out on me , except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now . but i 'd say you 've been very fair . i just think it 's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple .
threatened to blow my brains out ?
this whole time , you 've kept your head . you did n't go money simple like me and wes . you 've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here . and you 've been fair too . i mean , even after i ... you know ...
thanks .
i want you to know ... i do n't know . i just think you 're a hell of a guy .
yeah .
epps .
then i 'm a rich man .
yeah , but why me ? what if the car does n't stop ?
somebody has to .
why do i have to lie in the road ?
you lie in the middle of the road , look like you 're hurt . when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head .
how do we do that ?
a car 's got to come along sooner or later . when it does , we jack it .
well ?
you should n't think about things like that . it 'll just make you crazy .
what if it had n't been wes ? what if ... i mean , accidently , what if i had ...
we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we 're out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .
but ...
it 's always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i 'd better ... take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
when did you make the switch ?
it was n't the gold . it was the claymore mine . the gold 's in my pack .
the ... the gold ...
damn it . we lost the horses .
we go this way .
which way do we go ! ?
no , but i figure now 's a real good time to start .
can you ride a horse ?
me ? i say you do n't have enough brains to be stupid .
i did n't say that . i never said --
you were shot . we were standing right there , you were shot !
... wes ... ?
maybe ... maybe if we traded them the gold . if we gave it to them they might let us live ; they might not kill us .
you come up with a better plan , let me know .
we ca n't just sit here waiting to die .
with what ? against how many ?
... maybe ... maybe we can fight our way out .
i do n't know !
why have n't they killed us ! ?
i do n't know . they killed wes .
is that good , or bad ?
shi'ites , i think .
what do you make of them ?
we keep going , that 's what we do . we ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
what do we do ?
sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we 'll know we 're heading towards saudi arabia .
to where ?
we ca n't stay here . even if that was n't an iraqi soldier it 's only a matter of time before some show up . get all the water you can carry , and we 'll head out on foot .
what do we do ?
i do n't know . he did n't have a uniform on . he ... he had on white robes , like the guys who killed wes .
an iraqi ?
shoot them !
i just said i would . i do n't think i --
do n't go bitch on me now ! you were going to kill me . kill them !
i do n't have a weapon .
ca n't you --
well , you 're going to start with a bang , 'cause you 've got four of them to take down .
i ... i never killed anyone before . i told you that .
and then shoot them .
and then what ?
slip out your m-16 .
what are we going to do ?
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them . they could n't tell in the dark .
oh , god ...
they must be saudis . it 's a saudi checkpoint . oh sweet , jesus . come on . come on !
i do n't know . something wes had taught me . i think it means `` do n't shoot . we 're your friends . ''
what did you say ?
probably .
that 's if the war is even still going on . way things were shaping up it 's probably long over .
hell , they 'll probably just surrender to us . probably .
even if they are iraqis probably all they 'll do is take us prisoner for awhile . got to figure we 're still kicking their asses in the war . they do n't want any trouble .
yeah , i guess we should .
well , we should identify ourselves .
well ?
epps . what if they 're not saudi .
we can head back for our lines , and they do n't even have to know about the gold .
could n't be syria . we could n't have gone that far north . it 's got to be saudi . come on .
which boarder ? saudi ? kuwait ? syria ?
place all alone like that ? must be a boarder check point .
what do you figure it is ?
yeah , but we made that deal while wes was still alive . he 's gone . time for a new deal .
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
i just want to look at it . remind me of what i 'm dying for .
do n't you touch it .
you know what i 'm going to do ? i 'm just going to take a second . i want to look at the gold .
we 've got to keep moving while there 's still light .
just let me rest for a second .
no !
epps ... epps ! i 'm gon na stop for a second .
it 's a desert . that 's what deserts do at night ; they get cold .
getting cold .
okay . then we go this way .
i pick that way .
you sure you want me too ?
we ca n't just sit here . we 've got to start moving , so pick .
it 's got to be going better than this..
wonder how the war 's going ?
if we can find the hummer , or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay . we 've got enough water for that . but we wo n't make another day otherwise .
what do you think our chances are ?
damn .
sorry .
i never had anything before , epps . i never was anybody . not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins . when i was in high school i used to --
it 's all right . i do n't like it , but it 's over now .
i know what i did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much i want that gold .
makes two of us .
i do n't want to die .
yeah .
epps ?
what ? yeah .
you still got a map on you ?
really , i 'm not . remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis ? that 's all it was was talk . i was scared out of my mind to go to war . i still have n't gotten over stepping on that land mine .
sure .
i never killed anybody before . i talk a good game , but i 'm not like that .
yeah . well , me too .
i 'm glad i did n't have to kill you . i 'm glad it did n't come to that .
is it all right if i stand up ?
i 'm sorry about that , epps .
that helicopter passes , and the only thing we 're close to is death .
i do n't want it this way . i would n't kill you just to kill you , but i ca n't let you lose the gold for me . not when we 're so close .
and you ; you 've got it all together .
i 'm not like wes . wes was crazy .
first wes , now you ?
they 'll search the pack .
we 'll lie .
they 'll ask questions ; want to know why we were out here .
what do you mean no ? they can fly us home .
no .
we need something : a flare , a signal mirror .
no .
then he will be when those iraqis get to him . he was going to kill you . he was one blink away from it . he 's dead , epps , and i 'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass .
what if he 's not ?
wes is dead !
we ca n't just leave him .
forget wes .
we got to go back . we got to go back for wes .
we 'll find our way ! we 'll ...
how ! ?
we 'll find our way .
what are we going to do ? how are we going to find our way back ! ?
you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you 're wrong , and you 're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it . we 're heading northeast .
it should , or it will ? least going back the way we came we know what we 're up against .
there 's another pass on the photo . we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .
northeast ? that 's away from the hummer ; further into iraqi .
we should head northeast .
it stays as it is . we 're halfway home now . let 's not blow it by people getting ideas .
wes might be right about that .
not when you 're up here with the gold , i guess not .
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line . it did n't seem that long .
what the hell took so long .
yeah . yeah , that 'll work .
all right . you go up , i 'll send up the gold , then follow .
someone 's got to send the gold up . it ca n't get on the line by itself .
i do n't see how that plan 's any better .
jesus , jaeger .
why do i have to stay down here ?
what 's to stop him if he wanted to ? all he has to do is cut the line ...
he 's not going to leave us .
we send the gold up what 's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here ?
what ?
what ?
wait .
you do n't have to imagine it . not anymore . now all you 've got to think up is what it 's going to buy you .
i would n't know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
it 's not like i figured . it 's cold . and it 's heavier than i imagined .
yeah , bwana , you got it .
is it dead ?
it 's just a mongoose .
it 's giving .
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that 's where the light comes from . could n't see it with the lanternon .
must be a compartment .
get up off your ass and dig !
we 've been digging . we 've been digging for hours . if there was anything here to find we would have found it .
get up and dig .
i 'm not . and i 'm not doing anything , because there 's nothing down here .
it looks like you 're not doing anything .
what does it look like i 'm doing ?
what are you doing ?
so where do we start ?
a whole lot of nothing .
right now i would n't be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns .
think there might be more iraqis ?
if they land , we can take them . if they do n't land , then we 've got nothing to worry about .
if they land --
they ca n't shoot us in here .
they 're going to kill us !
we 're not going to do anything .
what are we going to do ? what the hell are we going to do ?
just stay down .
where the hell is it ! ?
stay low .
where is it ? where 'd it go ?
i hope it means something , otherwise ...
but the white dot in the middle ; that 's got to mean something .
something like that .
x marks the spot .
so good bye , shi'ites . thanks for playing . we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go .
not enough . we 're out numbered and out gunned . they 'd cut us to shreds .
the shi'ites are on our side ? i did n't know that .
they 're doing more than slapping .
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
well , it 's iraq . i 'm not sure , but i 'm guessing that has something to do with them being here .
what are they doing here ?
iraqis . a bunch of them .
single shots does n't mean a fire fight . that 's not a battle going on .
it 's a fire fight .
do n't !
shut up and listen !
i do n't hear any --
yeah , i understand . wes does n't want to come along in the first place , but he gets a third of the find . that 's a sweet deal .
i did n't have to stop anything , 'cause nobody was going to do nothing . we 're in this together , understand ?
just figure it 's my map , i ought to hang on to it .
you 're not losing trust , are you ?
it 's the treasure , that 's what it is .
this . whatever it is .
if we step on a mine we 'll know it was . let me see the maps .
you do n't know that . it could be a trick .
wes is right . if there were any more mines we would have found them . hell , that one you stepped on was probably old anyway ; left over from the war with iran .
you 're going to blow yourselves up .
do n't let me die , epps . i do n't want to die .
when we start running suck up your breath . you 're going to get the wind knocked out of you .
you 're not going to let me die , are you ! ? do n't let me die !
you 're going to be fine .
that 's going to do it , right ? i 'm going to be okay .
me and wes each going take an end of the rope , run our asses of , and yank you off the mine .
how 's this going to work ?
it falls asleep and you die , so wake it the hell up .
i 'm the one who can feel my leg , and it 's falling asleep .
it 's not falling asleep . you 've only been standing there for three minutes .
my leg is falling asleep .
epps , my leg is falling asleep .
i said nobody dies . nobody dies .
epps ...
there 's a way .
i said be cool , all right ? now be cool !
you 're moving away because it 's going to blow up , is n't it ! ? it 's going to blow up !
we 're going to be right over here .
why you got to move away to talk ! ?
me and wes are just going to talk .
where you going ?
we 're going to get off , all right . we 'll get you off of there . just ... be cool .
how 'm i gon na relax standing on a mine ! ?
just relax .
it 's a mine , is n't it ?
just be cool .
oh , god ! oh god !
i heard it .
if you stepped on a mine you 'd be dead by now . nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore .
i heard it click .
you did n't step on any mine .
mine . land mine !
what ?
mine .
what ! ?
i 'm just going to have a little sip , that 's all . just a sip .
do n't drink up all of yours , 'cause you are n't getting any of ours .
i 'm gon na ... i 'm just gon na stop for a little water .
yeah . i know . i 'm with you .
faster we get there , faster we get back .
hey ... hey ! slow up . you do n't have to go so fast .
i got that ... sir .
say it !
we leave it .
what do we do with the humvee ?
i did n't miss it . i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you 'd want to turn back .
and you missed this ? how are you going to miss something like this ?
... i know .
look at it . look at it ! shot to hell . it 's been leaking gas since the fire fight . i told you to check for damage .
millionaires , man .
it 'd make their heads explode .
i know . i know . but i 'm saying , if they knew . we 're going to be millionaires , man . millionaires !
you ca n't tell anybody about this .
i 'm just thinking , you know , if the rest of the boys knew what we 're doing . i mean if they knew what we were coming back with .
what ?
let 's go .
yeah . yeah , she 's fine .
she okay ?
i steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !
steady it out !
look at you , not even breaking a sweat . you 're cool , boy . you 're cool .
figure they do n't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them .
it 's the only way . we drive !
they 're not going to --
we run they 'll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we 're americans they might get scared , think we 're part of a detachment and keep on going .
they 'll shoot us !
we can see them , they can see us . we run , they chase .
we 've got to do something . we 've got to turn around .
shut up ! both of you shut the hell up !
take the goddamn binoculars !
wh-what do you think --
take the binoculars .
you know , you sound just like a boy who 's never --
and i 'm talking about enjoying myself .
it 's not about being fun . it 's about being smart . you take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you do n't ever have to do anything again . ever . that 's freedom . that 's what i 'm talking about .
oh , that 's fun .
invest it .
what are you going to do with your < u > third < /u > ?
you 're getting gold , and you 're going to blow it on wheels ?
a car ? you 're going to buy a car ?
yeah . i meant ... you know what i 'm going to do with it ? i 'm going to buy a sixty- three 'vette stingray . all tricked out and cherry . i 'm going to be so sweet .
third . what you 're going to do with your third .
you know what i 'm doing with my part of the gold ?
but that 's the great thing about gold . a little goes a long way .
cool it , jaeger . hey , wes ? wes ?
you 're such a pussy , you know that ? how 'd you get in the army ?
roger that .
now this is war .
we go , we get rich , we go home . it 's that easy .
it 's going to be cool , wes . it 's all all right .
but we all got to be in for this . we all go , or we do nothing .
we disappear for awhile . we disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .
it 's war . people get lost all the time in war , cut off --
what we 're doing is kicking ass . for god 's sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews . the war is over . we 've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money , and we 've got to put on a show for the taxpayers .
and you know what that area is ? it 's iraq . iraq ! we 're doing a little thing with them right now ; desert storm . maybe you 've read about it .
christ ! wes , tell him . you know this stuff .
wellllll , if you read it it must be true . was it in the star , or the enquirer ?
just listen to me ! i 've been doing some reading . in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks . it became part of the ottoman empire . when the turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards . they buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle boxes . i read about this , man . i read about it .
i think you 've got some issues to deal with . really , when we get out of here i 'm pretty sure it 's shrink time for you .
wait . wait .
do n't even . you 're not going to show me that tired map .
i 'd like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt .
everybody 's got a job to do . figure it this way : at least you get to go home alive .
they finally start the ground war , and where are we ? same place we 've been since we got here . securing freedom for the dirt .
yeah , that 's exactly what i think . you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes . let 's get out of here . we got sand to protect .
you think ?
i did it ! i got the box open .
what ! ? what ! ?
oh my god !
you all want to lay off ? god . i hope the iraqis shoot me ; put me out of my misery .
i 've got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place .
why you in such a hurry to get to shooting ?
this is stupid . it 's going on a month now . how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards ? they can bomb them all they want , saddam ai n't going anywhere without a ground assault . what the hell is the army waiting for ?
there might be .
yeah , the deed to the brooklyn bridge .
there might be something in there .
oh , man , you 're not going to fall for that .
blow me . have i said that to you guys recently ? blow me .
do n't worry about jaeger . he uses his personality as a form of birth control .
another month in this desert and i might just .
blow me .
you know what ? i think you got schwarzkopf . you did ! you got the general right in the ass . now that 's good shooting .
no you 're not .
i told you , i 'm shooting iraqis .
ready for what ? what are you supposed to be doing ?
do n't get pissed at me , just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts .
knock it off !
at-at-at-at-at .
what does it look like i 'm doing ? i 'm killing iraqis . at-at-at-at-at . at-at- at-at --
what are you doing ?
at-at-at-at-at . at-at-at-at-at .
saddam 's got a boil on his ass ?
they 're all good ones . satellites we 've got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam 's ass .
some good ones .
the photos .
ready for what ? sight-seeing ?
just ... want to be ready when we do .
planning on going to war all by your lonesome ?
i could use some recon photos too .
that should n't be too hard to read . iraq is the pink thing .
a map ? all i got is maps . i 'm gon na have delayed map syndrome when i finally get out of here . what kind of map you need ? topographical , geographical , thermal ?
i 'm looking for a favor . i need a map of iraqi .
hey , jaeger . what 's up .
woods .
you actually got around to killing someone . i 'm impressed . i guess you 're only half a bitch .
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint . jesus , wes , i killed the iraqis in there .
when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic . turns out we 've been kicking ass in this little war . they figure we 've finally gotten saddam off their backs . they brought me to their camp , cleaned me up , fed me ... i 'm their new best buddy . america number one , joe . but there 's something the shi'ites ca n't figure out : they ca n't figure out why my two buddies , two fellow americans , left me out in the desert . they ca n't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost . it 's almost as if they were iraqi spies , or something . and i 've got to tell you they hate anything that 's got to do with the iraqis . see how i mean ?
probably shot a few . scattered the rest . murderers .
think the iraqi 's killed them all ?
the white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler . that 's why they wear them .
you 're going to burn up in those .
you want to say some words ?
maybe we ought to ... you know , bury him . say some words over him .
he 'd just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .
so we 'll take him with us . at least 'til we get back to the hummer .
i 'm not wasting my water on him .
i think he wants something to drink .
all last night he could have been --
maybe we should give him some water .
he lived through that ?
says he 's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter .
he 's a soldier . he does n't need a weapon . he 's got rocks . he 's got bare hands .
with what ? he does n't have a weapon .
i think we found something .
what the hell are you doing ! ?
what do you see ?
yeah , we 're down .
you down ?
guess we know what the next stop is .
it 's got a bottom .
lines up with the map and the photos .
what do you think ?
just seems weird they did n't chase us .
maybe they 're as scared of us as we are of them .
we make it , or we go back empty handed .
think we can make it ?
i 've got a new agenda now , it 's get rich . the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all .
you 're the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad .
funny you should say that while we 're out looking for gold .
we 're american soldiers . we do n't abandon people .
we have to do something .
so ?
i know you 're a pussy . i know that .
is there anything you do know ?
those people down there are shi'ites . you 've got shi'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north . neither of them 've got much love for saddam . probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising , so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some .
jesus ! what the hell did he do that for ? they 're iraqis . why are iraqis killing iraqis ?
anytime you want to do something about it just let --
i 'm getting tired of you riding me , jaeger .
probably would 've too if epps was n't around to stop you .
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself .
you want to crawl , crawl .
that do n't mean nothing . iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we 're in the clear .
have n't found a mine for half a mile , or more .
until we 're out of the mine field is how long .
how long we going to keep this up .
does n't matter . we 're not going to be able to get him off it anyway .
epps ...
you have to go with us . you ca n't walk back ...
really ? what is that , an order , < u > private < /u > ?
you have to go with us , wes .
you two do n't even know how crazy you are . you want to go on your sick , little treasure hunt then go ahead , but mark me absent .
as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway . we 're not that far . we can make it .
then lets go back while we still can .
we 're not stranded . we 've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back .
... i figured ... i figured you 'd turn back .
so , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?
we just about got killed . you know what happened ? we just about got killed , and you want to go on ?
we 're not going anywhere . not 'til we get what we came for .
we have to go back .
we got to get out of here .
yeah , well , we 're not .
i thought we were dead .
you see that ? right by us . they went right by . you had them epps ; you called it .
i think i 'm going to throw up . i am . i 'm going to toss .
yeah ! yeah !
they 're not ... i had the pictures . they 're not supposed to be here !
oh , jesus !
two vehicles . they 're not supposed to be here .
oh , god !
iraqis .
a car is not just a car where i come from . i had this friend , had this wicked candy apple red sixty-four and a half mustang --
this is too much . you do n't even have the money and you 're wasting it .
you know what i 'm doing with my half ?
if there 's gold . if !
how the hell should i know how much ?
yeah ! gold ! how much ?
i do n't know . it would be small , easy to transport and hide . gold or jewels . probably gold .
yeah . if . whatever . what kind you figure it is ?
if ! if there 's a treasure .
hey , wes , what kind of treasure you figure these people buried ?
oh , no .
epps , is that a sand dune .
hell , we 'll just buy our way out .
we 're going to get court martialed , you know that .
yes !
god ! i do n't believe i 'm doing this . i do n't .
you 're insane if you think you 'll find anything , and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive .
you know it 's real . you know it 's real , and you know it 's there . you know it .
epps , you 're smarter than this . jaeger i understand , but you 're smarter .
so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase ? it 's crazy . tell him it 's crazy , epps .
it 's real . i 'm telling you , it 's real .
it 's not a hundred miles . it 's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain : pure desert , mountains , a river . if the map is even real .
it 's about a hundred miles from where we are now . how long do you think it would take us to --
you do n't know where the iraqis have moved to . and our forces have n't even engaged the republican guard yet , we do n't know --
it 's right here . this region ; an-nagaf . i got recon photos . there 're no troops there , no fighting --
you 're not saying what i think you 're saying . i ca n't believe you 're even thinking it .
with ... with millions . millions of dollars .
what ?
we ... we could go home with something else .
those soldiers have got loafers on . what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers ?
that 's it . it 's over . eighteen hours into the war and it 's over .
it 's a container . break the seal .
it 's ... it 's ... i do n't know what it is .
you know what , wes ? if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war .
the longer the air force hits the iraqis , the safer it'ii be for us when we have to engage .
at-at-at-at-at .
this is so weird . it 's happening , but it 's not . it 's like a tv show , and we 're part of it .
at-at-at-at-at .
the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass i 'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over . the only people who i 've got anything to worry about are the poor , dumb camel jockeys who do n't know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling at them ; an m-16 in each hand , and a grenade between my teeth . now if you 'll excuse me , soldier , i 'd like to get back to my box . i 've got a treasure to find .
you ever think about it ? you ever worry ?
come on , man . i almost had this thing open .
you ever think about dying ?
what ! ?
jaeger ?
why would they do all that if we were n't ?
it does n't mean anything .
we 're going to war , are n't we . if they 're doing all that it must mean we 're going to war .
what 's your point , wes ? you have a point ?
they 're cancelling all leaves , all passes . no more drills . we stand at full ready starting --
like i said ; so ?
that 's in two days .
yeah . so ?
you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait .
what ?
jaeger ?
i do n't care if there 's a lump of coal in here . i just want to be able to rub epps ' face in it when i crack this thing .
you really think there 's a treasure inside ?
i 'll show epps . he 'll be sorry when i get this thing open .
you will . you 'll get it .
naw , nothing .
you get it yet ?
i could .
and you 're the guy who 's going to open it .
for real ? a treasure ?
it 's a puzzle box . if you can figure out how to open it there 's supposed to be a treasure inside .
yeah , you 're funny .
he says it 's a box .
what is it ? you know so much about arabland tell me what it is .
now you need me .
what is this ?
do n't even try it . you offend a woman out here you 're in serious trouble .
how do you say `` come here , baby . i 'm horny . '' i can use that now .
do n't shoot me , i 'm friendly . you can use that when you surrender .
what does that mean ?
i thought it would be good to know .
spanish was n't hard enough ?
i 'm just trying to help you guys out . it does n't hurt to know something about saudi arabia .
it was an accident . you saw it was an accident .
come on . you 're going to get us in trouble .
oh yeah . accidently .
i 'm saying do n't do it accidently .
when do you ever point the soles of your feet at people ?
people were suffering in afganistan , and we did n't do anything .
people are suffering .
i do n't think we 'll go to war . we should n't even be here . this is n't our fight , it 's a regional conflict . it should be decided regionally .
we ought to kick their asses anyway . even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses .
okay .
yes . yes . that 's exactly it . yes .
i 'm making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does n't bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
yeah , a headache . my head hurts . you 're making me uncomfortable .
a headache ?
could you stop , please . you 're giving me a headache .
no , tetanty .

it 's the end .
oh , thx ... hold me , hold me , thx holds her tightly , tears in his eyes . they kiss , and luh hides her head in thx 's chest .
no ... no , no .
no one can see us now we 're alone .
they 're watching us now .
they do n't know .
they know . they 've been watching us . i can feel it .
ah ugh .
are you all right ?
do n't let them separate us .
it 's all right now , shhhh it 's all right .
we could leave , and live in the superstructure ... .
then what ? it ca n't go on forever . you know it ca n't .
i know you can do it without sedation , you can , i know you can .
if i take something , you suffer . if i do n't , i stuff ... .
you do n't know . you do n't ... .
i could n't turn you in , not now . i ... .i know i would n't !
i 've got a slip movement to install on my next shift . i 'll never make it the way i am now .
if you ... .if you go back on sedation , you wo n't feel the same way about me . you 'll report me for drug evasion .
i do n't know .
what are you doing ?
i do n't want to lose you .
i ca n't go on like this . i ca n't ... . i do n't just sit around and watch people . if i make a mistake , it 's all over . you see it every day . do you want to see me taken away in pieces ?
but ... you ...
what do you think you 're doing ? you 're going to get us arrested .
on the cervix transfer , you almost lost the t297 .

you slipped on a t297 transfer just before lunch , did n't you ?
you 're not cleared for this precinct . let 's cross over first .
no ... .i though i 'm afraid .
what are you doing here ? is anything wrong ?
promise ... please do n't thx leaves the room .
i 'll try .
do n't take anything .
they 'll come for me right away if i 'm not there . i have to go .
no ! do n't go .
three ! i 'm going to be late for my shift .
it 's 3+27 hundred
i said what time is it ? how long was i out ?
what ?
what time is it ?
but it 's so hopeless ... you 're so beautiful .
i was so scared ... i did n't know what would happen with you ... once i started . i almost let you go on so many times . it will be worth it , together . when i was alone , i knew .
what ? ... oh , no , thx . that 's not true . not satisfied ? thx , i need you so much .
now ... now , i 'm sorry ... do n't - do n't ... .please . it 's just ... i was happy . why get me involved ? you told sen that you were n't satisfied with me .
looks like food .
that 's not food . ca n't be food .
look , food !
looks like dirt .
that 's not dirt ... ca n't be dirt.. dirt is a violation .
look , dirt !
i 've never been under the table before .
do n't be so sure .
i have n't done anything .
i did n't . you asked me about the card . you 're going to get us into trouble .
then why did you bring it up ?
no , do n't make trouble . it 's nothing .
you do n't have to ... i do n't trust him . you ought to file a report .
i have to ... he 's a g-34
do n't go .
i do n't know .
a shift change should come through the scheduling office .
he wants me to come to his quarters .
now ?
now .
when ?
i have to see sen. i 've just been given a shift change .
what did you get ?
eat your dinner .
you know i do n't feel well .
you 've seen enough .
what 's this ? why did you change it ?
what 's the matter with you ?
no , your going to eat it , or it will go to waste .
well it 's fixed , so you 'll have to eat it .
i 'm not hungry .
it seems i am destined to endure many frustrations ... .but at the same time i am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction , and that even if it remains incomplete , my search has not been in vain .
there goes another of your disciples .
a shelldweller . they live in the outer shell of the city . quite unique , there have been two here before . they smell .
good lord !
what ?
but we need a creative dissent . our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus , but the differences are differences of emphasis , not of fundamentals . now , the new alignment 's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements , rather than march along in parallel line that never converge . tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly , we will gain a new unity .
what are you talking about ? when did you sleep last ? do you know what your trouble is ? you 're blind . you 've been here so long you ca n't see what is happening . we must unite . we need unity . we need action. ) we have come to a time when we must ... .
you always manage to avoid the issue : what 's wrong with our present condition ? we 're comfortable and we have plenty of food ... i feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat . why incite trouble ? you should examine your emotions . it is senseless ...
i 've said many times before , and i guess i 'll have to repeat it again for your ...
then why are they holding us here ? why do n't they destroy us right away ? economically , it 's not sound at all . very much unlike ... .
but you ca n't . we must escape .
thx and me .
who ? who 's leaving ?
we 're leaving .
what ?
we 're leaving .
what 's going on ... .what are you doing ?
we can not stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed . you can work with us . an organized plan of escape must be devised first . could you see anything ? you want to leave . you 're not like them . you must have left something , or someone .
i thought you were through with it !
incredible !
we must escape . we have plans . we can leave . we must wait until ...
it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind , but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design .
that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
ask him about the air . he looks out of breath .
wait ! i 'll talk to him .
i wonder how far he went . he 's gathered invaluable information out there .
he 's coming back for the rest of us . he ca n't make it alone .
impossible !
i can just barely see him . i think he 's leaving .
no one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry . this world is in a state of static-mobility : we are at the same time moving and standing still .
what ?
i 've got it ! astounding !
on the contrary ! it absolutely proves what i have always felt . we are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits . we are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth . we must continue the search .
not very encouraging .
out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings , there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals , most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted .
well ?
you have nothing to fear . you 're safe again .
how far did you go ? was it cold ?
no , look ! three degrees from the central azimuth .
i ca n't see him at all . he 's been destroyed .
look !
what ?
but you ca n't ... you .
right now .
when ? ... ..how ?
i 'm leaving .
what ?
i 'm leaving .
get out of here , leave me alone .
listen to me ... .you have no need to distrust me . we 're going ... .
i 'll report you . it 's ... .
you know i have a way with the computers . i can clear myself for any area ... ..almost .
what are you doing here ? you 're not cleared for this area !
i do n't feel well .
i wo n't have another mate like ona . you rate very high in sanitation . i 've checked . in fact , i am surprised that you were ever matched with luh . her ratings are very erratic - you know what i mean . we 'll be happy .
do n't say that . you look ... you 're not well .
you 're in violation .
we had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch . she felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place ... you 're upsetting yourself . would you like something ?
i do n't understand . living ... .selection is computed . you ca n't ... what have you done to luh ? she was here..
it will be good for both of us . i 've got it all arranged .
where 's luh ?
i want you for my roommate .
what 's going on ?
why are you so concerned ?
why did you have luh come here ?
what ?
where is luh ?
i 'm sure it 's warmer in her than outside , though . i have n't been out yet , but it usually is ... the control is fouled ...
i thought of something ... ..
just look at all those people .
save yourself ... .
what do you want ?
i 'm sorry .
i 'm only trying to help you .
no ... no you 're wrong .
look more closely .
where 's luh ?
remember this ... ?
all right ...
you do n't know that !
no ... ... she 's dead thx ... ... ..
she 's not there
no ?
that 's not it .
shut up .
soon he 'll be a plastic cube .
i knew him .
no ! ... .
this one has eyes . why did they leave your eyes ? could you ever ... .
all the insides are gone !
would you like part of this ? ... .it 's not much .
i 'm all right thx rises and they begin to walk along the passageway . at the end of the hall is a small metal door , a sign read `` level 842con g , division of plastic , vendable manufacturing stations '' the door is jammed and it is difficult to open . finally the latch snaps and the door swings open .
what have you done , cut your hand ?
must be an expressway ... . you do n't have to stay here , you know ... .
what was that ... .
i do n't care .
oh , that ! i 'm 5555 srt entron..

no excuses , just do it !
how the hell do you feel yellow ?
when in doubt , pull the yellow wire .
what ... ?
i do n't know .
which one 's which ?
okay , one of the caps turns it on , the other shuts it down .
yeah , another round thing .
make up your mind , trigger .
too easy . there 's got ta be something else in there , another cap maybe .
what 's wrong ?
that 's the blasting cap - good ! okay , now grab it by the base and pull it straight up . no , wait ...
something round , two wires ...
stay to your left .
more metal ... sharp edge ...
do n't touch that .
wires ... metal , cold ... something soft ...
close your eyes , feel your fingertips . tell me everything you feel .

c'mon , talk to me ! we can do it !

what do we do ?
off the scale .

you got it .
glass , eighth street , alley behind grand hotel . cut him off .
me , too .
no , i 'd slip out past the hotel district , behind greyhound ...
would you ?
should we head for the interstate ?
cuz he got the girl , now he 's leaving town .
how do you know ?
catch that alert ? that 's him in the u-haul .
driving in circles , waiting for-
where you guys at ?
what 's up ?
be right back .
ex-girlfriend ?
congratulations , you just built your first ticker .
it 's working .
no you 're not , you just do n't understand them . here , do what i tell you .
i terrible with mechanical things .
i guess i did n't realize how much i needed him . he kept me straight . it 's been tough every second since .
your partner ?
i know . i was working a drug ring , deep cover . played the part too well . when they pulled me out , i was n't a cop anymore . my fiance had dumped me . next thing i knew , i was out here on the street , doped up , auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me , cleaned me up , gave me a second chance . he promised captain winters he 'd look out for me .
take a tip from the bomb boys , always assess , if only for a second .
pittsburgh , two years ago . partner died , no back-up , i was too gung-ho . as usual .
you do n't have to talk about it .
what ?
how long were you hooked ?
i do n't know . there 's an old saying , when in doubt , cut the yellow wire .
which one 's which ?
one shuts it down , one turns arms it .
so cut both .
i do n't know , it 's strange ... it 's not the best career path , but when you get the bug , there 's nothing you can do about it . see , when you beat one of these things ...
why do you do it ?
we 've got ta be . in this business , you do n't exactly make alot of outside commitments .
you guys seem pretty tight .
well ... it 's more than we had ten minutes ago .
right .
what not bad . you 've got a series of bombs , devices , that may or may not be connected , set by one or many nutjobs , who may or may not be linked .
not bad for bomb squad , eh ?
`til we get a better lead .
how long are we going to stay ?
industrial wood oil . separately , any one of these things could lead in several directions , but together ...
nitro-cellulose . what is that , some kind of explosive ?
bingo !
look , it 's a longshot ...
then , it 's got ta be here somewhere ...
yep .
this is where the van was parked .
no , ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney . they 're into the power trip , not the damage . what scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants , then disappear . the worst of the bunch , they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever ... and they love the carnage .
except they 'll blow you up if you do n't play along .
typical profile , usually losers , nobodies that 're afraid to confront their victims . they like scaring people . that 's why they call in their threats . same mentality as obscene phone callers .
with a little training , you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that 'd finish off that alleged car of yours . heck , did n't you ever watch macgyver ?
just how easy is it to build a ... device ?
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith , bill jones . i 'd see them up ahead in the hall , call their name , but they would n't turn around . c.i.a . funny thing , they 'd always disappear after the first half of the course .
sounds like terrorist heaven .
top of my class at west point , thank you very much . then off to redstone . first half of the course we learned how to build devices ... second half , we 'd take them apart . everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs .
cream of the crop , huh ? you ?
redstone 's the army training center in alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers .
you mentioned something called redstone .
an abandoned machine shop ... nice place to build devices . low rent , too . but , you and rice ruined their perfect hideout .
i do n't know . you tell me ?
so what were they doing here ?
then let 's go see what they missed .
the place has already be combed . forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside .
drive .
oh yeah ? prove it .
no you look , mister ! first , you do n't go calling my men names . it 's bad for morale . second , us `` punks '' happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did .
hey , look --
nice performance back there . where 'd you learn that , mike ditka sensitivity seminar ?
where ... ?
only once , at redstone .
she 's not talking . but , she could be . so , obviously , you 've seen one of these devices before ?
i.r.a . device . deadliest class of tickers in existence . computerized , multiple sensors , booby traps , the works . first showed up in a series of i.r.a . bombings in london couple years ago . one of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers . the girl , is she irish ?
do n't push it , slick .
anything else i should know ?
treat . we treat devices .
so you 're the `` device squad '' ... and you defuse `` devices '' ?
we do n't use the b-word . bad luck .
mike reilly .
by the way , i 'm glass . this is t.j. , and pooch .

yes , sir .
you know after a shooting i would normally take your badge and weapon , but glass called in already and confirmed it was clean .
report on the case so far .

sir , i --
reilly , what the hell happened out there ? why did n't you call for back-up ?
captain ...
no ! but let me tell you -- any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag -- phooey , phooey , phooey !
well , have you found it ?
diamonds all over .
yes .
and diamonds in the front .
yes .
and it had diamonds in the back .
yes .
so you lost a handbag , madame ?
what ? i may lose it again ? but i have n't found it yet ! i 'm sorry . goodbye ! yes ?
yes , m'sieu laval !
tell m'sieu giron i ca n't see him now . impossible ! and , jacques . dismiss the car ! madame is not going .
m'sieu giron is downstairs .
madame has changed her mind . she 'll be down in a minute .
yes , m'sieu laval ?
on staircase ; from gaston 's point of view . he stops .
in a moment .
m'sieu laval , m'sieu filiba would like very much to see you .
at once , jacques . we 'll continue later .
pardon me , m'sieu . madame colet would like to see you in the living room .
very well , jacques .
m'sieu laval , madame would like to talk to mademoiselle gautier for a moment .
he bows , goes . door shuts behind him .
with the compliments of colet and company !
a man in love , completely shaken . he sits on bed , thinks , then takes telephone slowly , decisively .
eleven o'clock !
in doorway . he bows , returns into office ; door shuts .
no !
erect in sweater , arms folded .
is this what you mean , m'sieu laval ?
where did you find it ?
still studying the vase . mariette appears . he turns to her .
so i said to myself , `` all right , if he wants to look at them , let him look at them . no harm in that . '' and then he said , `` say ah . '' and then i said , `` ah . '' and that 's all i remember ... and when i woke up , i still had my tonsils , but my pocketbook was gone .
< u > tonsili ! < /u >
about tonsils .
what did you talk about ?
that 's just what i tried to tell him . well , one word led to another . he really was a very charming fellow . so we talked for about ten minutes .
< u > niente ! < /u >
no !
the representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils .
i said , `` come in . '' and there he was . a fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns . he said , `` good evening . i 'm the doctor . '' i said , `` doctor ? '' he said , `` yes , the doctor . i came to see about your tonsils . ''
and then what happened , m'sieu filiba ?
well , he knocked at the door . you see , i was expecting two -- uh -- two business associates .
why did you let this man in , m'sieu filiba ?
i had exactly twenty thousand lire . i had just cashed a traveler 's check and put it in my wallet .
the representative of the police wants to know how much money you had , m'sieu filiba .
< u > all < /u > < u > kinds < /u > .
and harems ... ?
i do n't care < u > what < /u > you say ! in constantinople at least you have streets , sultans , pashas --
but --
let me tell you , venice < u > ca n't < /u > < u > compare < /u > with constantinople .
yes !
but you < u > have < /u > been in venice ?
no !
you 've never been in constantinople ?
no .
constantinople ?
no .
amsterdam ?
no .
no ... have < u > you < /u > ever been in vienna ?
you 've < u > never < /u > been in venice ?
no .
but before i say goodbye i want to ask you one question : have you ever been in venice ?
goodbye , m'sieu filiba .
i wanted to say goodbye to you .
you see -- no , no ! and < u > yet < /u > -- < u > did < /u > i -- did -- now < u > where < /u > could we have --
yes , m'sieu filiba ?
well -- then it must be my mistake . i beg your pardon .
i 'm sorry , but i do n't seem to recall the occasion . no , i 'm afraid ...
pardon me , m'sieu , but i have the feeling we have met somewhere before .
doc -- !
funny -- the first time i saw him i thought he was a doctor !
insignificant ... he 's a secretary , always < u > was < /u > a secretary , always < u > will < /u > be .
just dull .
he 's really not a bad fellow .
i thought so .
ogilvie and oglethorpe .
smart . london , eh ?
like it ?
nice suit .
you know , i 'm not the marrying type . i like to take my fun and leave it .
the type they marry .
no color , no sparkle -- but dependable .
funny , the kind of men women fall for .
no doubt about it -- it 's that secretary .
now see here , my good man . i 've had just about enough of your insulting remarks !
you 're looking fine , major .
umm .
nice day , major .
good morning . i'd-i'd-i 'd like to look at some cuff links .
good morning , major .
yes , baron . thank you .
you can trust me .
but please , baron . we 're not supposed to breathe a word of it . you wo n't tell anybody i told you ?
you 're not safe anywhere nowadays .
thank you .
no , baron ! i beg your pardon .
i do n't want to see you at all !
yes , baron ?
and as for you , waiter --
yes , baron .
i want to see --
yes , baron . moon in champagne .
i want to see that moon in the champagne .
yes , baron .
and , waiter -- you see that moon ?
yes , baron .
it must be the most marvelous supper . we may not eat it , but it must be marvelous .
um-hum . very good . excellent !
i would start with cocktails .
if casanova suddenly ... turned out to be romeo ... having supper with juliet -- who might become cleopatra ... how would you start ?
yes , baron .
oh , yes ... well , that 's not so easy . beginnings are always difficult .
yes , sir ? what shall we start with , baron ?
just call me gaston .
m'sieu monescu !
monescu .
m'sieu ...
then why did n't you call the police ? why < u > do n't < /u > you call the police ? i 'll tell you why -- you crook , you .
i know it !
you say i am a crook .
what do you mean ?
you have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years . you must be a man of about -- about sixty-five . let 's see -- you will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison .
what is it ?
yes , m'sieu . m'sieu giron !
otherwise i 'll call the police
very well , m'sieu .
and you will be out by tomorrow morning .
yes , m'sieu .
no , to you -- m'sieu < u > monescu < /u > .
it may be important to you , m'sieu giron --
right now ! it 's very important , m'sieu laval .
but not now .
i 've got to see you .
i 'm very sorry , but this is no time , m'sieu giron --
i do n't < u > know < /u > , m'sieu giron !
nervous ! why should i be nervous ?
i am only insinuating that you are nervous .
are you insinuating that this is not an honest report ?
and i do n't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report .
i do n't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown .
and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption .
i was only asking if you are related to the lavals of marseilles .
well , that 's fine . then you are not insinuating that i am avoiding questions . and i am not insinuating that you wo n't let me examine this report .
no , not at all !
are < u > you < /u > insinuating anything , m'sieu giron ?
um-hum !
two weeks and three days .
examination ! m'sieu laval , what are you insinuating ? i have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years . how long have you enjoyed madame 's confidence ? three weeks , i believe .
and you , m'sieu giron , seem to be disturbing my examination of < u > this < /u > < u > report < /u > .
and i have known the lavals of marseilles for more than thirty years .
for more than forty years . so madame told me .
m'sieu laval , i have enjoyed the confidence of this family --
i hope so , too .
i hope you find the figures correct .
just a second .
you must be related to the lavals of marseilles .
um-hum ...
m'sieu laval , there are several things i 've wanted to ask you for quite a while . i understand you are from marseilles .
no , captain , i tell you --
now just a minute , major --
no , no , no ! i disagree with you absolutely . that 's the trouble with you artillery men .
good day , major .
good day , doctor .
thank you , major .
just as you say , doctor .
you see , the bag has just been found , and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her . it 's not very serious , but just the same we 'd better not take any chances .
lily !
goodbye -- madame colet and company !
leave me alone ! you were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her . well -- she 's worth it ! [ you were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a < u > handbag < /u > . you can pay a < u > hundred < /u > thousand for him ! ]
lily --
and you --
do n't you dare lie to me ! i know you love me . well , why do n't you say something ? come on -- be brilliant . talk yourself out of it -- bluff yourself in ! shut up , you liar , you ! that 's what i want ! this is real ! money ! cash !

that 's what i 'm here for -- to get out ! i want to get away from here , from you -- as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me . sixty-five , ninety-four --
you < u > have < /u > to get out of here !
yes , < u > m'sieu < /u > < u > colet < /u > ?
now , lily --
what time is your rendezvous ?
are you insane ? you 've to get out of here at once ! she may come back any minute .

filiba ...
darling , remember you 're gaston monescu . you 're a crook . i want you as a crook . i love you as a crook . i worship you as a crook . steal , swindle , rob -- but do n't become one of those useless , good-for-nothing gigolos !
oh , no , darling . there 's < u > more < /u > sex appeal coming on the first of the month . it 's only ten days ... eight hundred and fifty thousand francs .
gaston . let 's open it -- right now ! let 's get away from here ! i do n't like this place !
beautiful . and what of it ? let me tell you something : so far as i 'm concerned , her whole sex appeal is in that safe !
they 're all right , are n't they ?
certainly !
did you ever take a good look at her -- uh --
ah !
< u > this < /u > < u > woman < /u > < u > has < /u > < u > more < /u > < u > than < /u > < u > jewelry < /u > .
but it 's not enough !
what ?
you ! and she 's willing to pay as high as fifty francs !
no jewelry ! hands off jewelry ! if we 're broke -- all right . i might pick up a million-franc necklace . but in times like < u > these < /u > when we 're doing a < u > cash < /u > < u > business < /u > -- why take a chance on jewelry ?
and her < u > jewelry < /u > is worth a fortune !
-- the other half , contrary to custom , shall be delivered in cash into madame 's personal custody . darling , that means that on the second of june we 'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs .
darling !
and we 'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we did n't get married !
seven and nine !
two fifty-three , five --
we 'll take the royal suite !
we 'll go to venice , to the same hotel !
the six --
and tomorrow is the fifteenth . and the day after tomorrow --
the fourteenth of may .
sweetheart , what day is today ?
right .
and take the twenty thousand francs ...
darling , then let 's be honest and return it to the lady .
yes ! do n't you remember the day you took that chinese vase from the royal palace and made it into a lamp for my night table ?
last year ? it ca n't be that long .
i always liked him . especially last year in munich ...
gaston !
gaston monescu .
monescu !
you remember the man who walked into the bank of constantinople and walked out < u > with < /u > the bank of constantinople ?
darling ! now tell me -- tell me all about yourself . who are you ?
what time is it ?
not at all , countess ... there 's one very good stone in it .
thank you , baron .
i 'm crazy about you . by the way , your pin .
i like you , baron .
you 're very welcome . countess , believe me , before you left this room i would have told you everything ... and let me say this with love in my heart -- countess , you are a thief . the wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three , five , seven , and nine is in your possession . i knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket . in fact , you tickled me . but your embrace was so sweet ...
no , thank you .
the pepper , too ?
thank you .
please .
please . when i came here it was for a little adventure -- a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow . but something has changed me -- and it is n't the champagne . the whole thing is new to me . very new . i 've got a confession to make to you . baron , you are a crook . you robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three , five , seven , and nine . may i have the salt ?
that 's hotel life . in one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses -- his head .
no -- proud . very proud !
disappointed ?
someone from another world -- so entirely different . one gets so tired of one 's own class -- princes and counts and dukes and kings -- ah ! and everybody talking shop -- always trying to sell jewelry ... and then i heard your name and found you were just one of us .
thank you !
you know , when i first saw you , i thought you were an american .
do n't stop . keep right on complaining . it 's beautiful .
but she talks a lot . and before this night is over , all venice will know it . and tomorrow it will be grand canal gossip ! ... oh !
why should you ?
you 'd better not . he 's really very dull . but anyhow , when the king tells the marquis he saw me , the marquis will tell the marchesa . and the marchesa is the best friend of the duchess of chambro . and < u > she < /u > will phone the princess de costa . the princess does n't like me -- but i do n't care !
i would like to .
do you know the marquis de la tours ?
no -- no .
do you < u > know < /u > king boris ?
but you came . and you must forget everything -- except that you are here , countess .
the tennis player . he saw me . he bowed . what could i do ? i nodded . baron , i should n't have come !
the tennis player ?
the marquis de la tours . he was in the lobby . but i do n't think he saw me . i 'm positive he did n't . thank heaven ! ... but when i came up here , right out in the hall there was king boris of alconia !
who ?
goodbye ...
divine ... but that terrible policeman !
lovely .
but it could have been glorious .
wonderful ... but tomorrow morning , if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock , and the door opens , and there , instead of a maid with a breakfast tray , stands a policeman with a warrant -- then you 'll be glad you 're alone .
divine ...
it could have been marvelous ...
goodbye .
goodbye ...
yes , giron ! chairman of the board of colet and company . honorary president of the orphans ' asylum . adolph j. giron -- distinguished citizen ! ... well , shall i call the police ? i see ! you have to be in the social register to keep out of jail . but when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up -- a self-made crook -- then you say , `` call the police ! put him behind bars ! lock him up ! ''
giron ... !
it would be a terrible scandal , would n't it ?
then why are you afraid to let me prove it ?
i do n't believe it !
why not ? he 's a thief -- he 's a criminal .
naturally not . but i expect the police to believe it .
and you expect me to believe that ?
adolph j. giron .
< u > adolph < /u > ?
you have been robbed -- for years . and not a hundred thousand francs , but millions . and you know who did it ? adolph .
yes , gaston ?
mariette !
thank you . seventy-six , eighty --
you look beautiful .
but why talk about robbery on a night like this ?
um- < u > hum < /u > ...
instantly .
call the police ?
i would n't say anything -- i would act .
what would you say if you found your safe had been robbed ?
yes , gaston ?
no -- thirty-five !
thirty-three --
please !
ah , let me have a little fun .
but i do n't want to be a lady .
on the night table .
when a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman 's room , where does she put them ?
because i want to make it tough for you .
then why do you want to go ?
i < u > believe < /u > you .
< u > i < /u > < u > love < /u > < u > you < /u > .
i know it .
i 'm crazy about you !
i < u > must < /u > go .
i want you to stay , mariette . you 've < u > got < /u > to stay . you ca n't go now !
< u > shut < /u > < u > up < /u > -- < u > kiss < /u > < u > me < /u > ! wasting all this marvelous time with arguments !
< u > now < /u > , < u > let < /u > < u > me < /u > < u > tell < /u > < u > you < /u > --
but attractive --
you 're conceited --
any minute i want !
so you think you can get me ?
and you 're going to fall for them .
i know all your tricks .
like that !
like that ?
yes , i would !
you would ?
but incidentally , let me tell you , < u > i < /u > do n't like < u > you < /u > . i do n't like you at all ! i would n't hesitate one instant to ruin < u > your < /u > reputation -- like that !
m'sieu laval , i 've got a confession to make to you ...
no -- yours , madame .
afraid i 'm ruining your reputation , m'sieu laval ?
precisely .
talk ? about me -- about us ?
but you have an engagement , and i do n't want people to talk .
goodbye .
good night .
good night .
correct ! good night .
crimson !
lipstick ?
marvelous .
hair ?
beautiful .
how do you like my dress ?
then a little nap --
together .
then lunch in the bois --
um-hum ...
then riding together .
um-hum ...
well , we 'll have breakfast in the garden .
what are you going to do with my day tomorrow , m'sieu laval ?
yes , madame ?
and so will m'sieu giron .
i 'll be delighted .
will you be good enough to run through these papers with m'sieu giron ?
madame .
you 're hired !
the same thing .
what would you do if you were my < u > secretary < /u > ?
and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs , i would give you a good spanking -- in a business way , of course .
ye-es ?
everything ! ... madame colet , if i were your father -- which , fortunately , i am not --
tell me , m'sieu laval , what else is wrong ?
it 's disgraceful !
and how i handle my < u > money < /u > !
then you use the wrong lipstick --
then i mislay my checkbook --
madame colet , i think you deserve a scolding . first , you lose your bag --
that sounds sensible .
no ! not enough ! in times like these , when everything is uncertain , every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm 's reach .
you think that 's too much ?
but , madame , you keep a hundred thousand francs -- in your safe -- at < u > home < /u > ?
is n't that wonderful ! you see , madame --
too happy . that 's why i discharged her .
i see . she must have been very happy here .
this used to be my secretary 's room .
oh ?
it < u > is < /u > beautiful . but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques , so i gave it to my secretary .
beautiful specimen .
right !
early eighteenth century . i should say around -- seventeen thirty .
yes !
eighteenth century .
as you like .
make it out to cash !
what ?
and do you know what i 'd like to have you do with that check ?
no . what is it ? tell me .
do you know my first name ?
then i 'm glad i lost the bag ! i 'll write you the check immediately .
do n't be embarrassed , madame . i 'll take it . i need the money . i wish i were in a position to ignore the whole matter . but you know , madame , the stock market , bank crash ... to make a long story short -- a member of the nouveaux poor .
yes .
in other words , madame , it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward .
goodbye , m'sieu la -- oh , yes ... this is a rather delicate matter and i do n't want to ... you see , if you read my advertisement carefully , you must have noticed that there was ...
but , madame colet , that 's a matter of eye shadow . i can straighten that out in two seconds .
do you realize i have light eyes ?
that 's too dark .
peaches and cream .
what shade of powder do you use ?
no , no , no ! i disagree with you completely ! i tried it once --
that 's what you need !
too much blue in crimson .
with your skin , i prefer crimson .
what 's wrong now ?
but one suggestion , madame . not the major . i do n't mind his grammatical mistakes . i 'll overlook his bad punctuation . but the letter has no mystery -- no bouquet -- no ... and one lipstick ... scarlet number four .
m'sieu laval !
you need n't be embarrassed , madame . a lady as charming as you would , and < u > should < /u > , get love letters .
oh !
naturally i did .
oh ! you did n't read it !
please , madame colet , i believe in doing things correctly . shall we continue ? two hairpins , one cigarette lighter , one box of real matches , and -- oh , yes , this letter from major --
but really , m'sieu , this is n't necessary .
one purse -- empty . one vanity case --
the pleasure is mine , madame .
well -- how do you do , m'sieu laval ?
and i am m'sieu laval -- if you will allow me to introduce myself .
well -- i am madame colet .
not in the least , madame . but you see , it 's a very expensive bag -- one has to be careful .
of course it is ! are you doubting me ?
oh ... that 's strange . maybe -- are you sure this is your bag ?
i do n't know how i could have lost it there . i was nowhere near that niche .
neither do i. that 's where i found it .
not particularly .
you like that statue ?
i remember .
and in that niche , there is a statue of venus .
i know that niche .
and as you leave the foyer , there is a little niche .
yes .
then you go into the foyer .
yes .
then you go to the left . there 's a landing .
yes .
you know the main staircase in the opera ?
that 's it ! yes , that 's it ! ... jacques !
will you be good enough to look at this bag , madame ?
yes ... ?
well , the evening is still young . let 's go down to the living room and talk it over . it 's only ten o'clock .
yes , madame !
no , m'sieu !
no , madame , it 's the way you < u > follow < /u > .
oh , no , it 's the way you lead .
i wanted to ask her to ask you if you 'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight .
what is it , madame ?
oh , that 's too bad . you see , i wanted her to do something . well , i guess i 'll have to do it myself .
yes -- uh --
has mademoiselle gautier gone ?
yes , madame colet ?
oh , m'sieu laval ...
jacques !
you know what paris is saying about the countess falconier and her chauffeur ?
he is my secretary ! i hope that answers all your questions , m'sieu giron .
madame , let me ask you : who is m'sieu laval , anyhow ? where does he come from ? what is he ?
i know !
madame colet , i 've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years . i was a school friend of your husband 's ...
to m'sieu laval ?
i 'm sorry , madame , but there are still certain matters which i think you should attend to yourself . and i , personally , would not care to refer them to -- to --
but my dear m'sieu giron , i 'm having a tea party . must i be bothered with all these papers now ?
i do n't want your money !
mademoiselle gautier -- or whatever your name is -- i thank you for your advice , but i must ask you to go . you 've got your money --
let me give you a little advice . when you embrace him , be sure to put on your gloves . it would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
i beg your pardon !
ever had a romance with a crook ?
i think you 'd better go .
oh , madame , you 're just too sweet for words !
well , in times like these most people are cutting salaries , but suppose we say , in your case , three hundred and fifty ?
how much is your salary ?
yes , madame ?
very well , madame . thank you .
oh , no , no , no , no , my dear child ! that 's ridiculous . you go home as usual -- five o'clock every day . now i 'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant -- i insist . it 'll be nice for your little brother , too . < u > five < /u > < u > o'clock < /u > -- remember !
i 'll do my best , madame , even if i have to work every night .
right !
for all the really important things --
yes ! and he would have a little more time for --
so he would n't be confined so much to his office --
no , he < u > works < /u > too much . he 's chained to his desk . too much detail . now , if you could take over some of his work --
nervous ? um-hum . he smokes too much !
to me he seems rather nervous .
well -- uh -- yes and no .
now . uh -- mademoiselle -- in the short time you have been m'sieu laval 's secretary , have you noticed any change in him ?
naturally not !
potatoes . he does n't want me to eat them -- and naturally i do n't want to upset him .
about what ?
you see -- oh , not a word to m'sieu laval !
yes , madame ?
may i ?
please ! thank you .
two lumps , madame ?
yes , that 's the trouble with mothers . first you get to like them and then they die .
yes , madame . you see , i have to get up very early . my little brother goes to school -- you see , mother is dead .
you 've had your breakfast -- oh , but of course you have .
well , where is it ?
yes , i saw it -- but --
but you saw it here .
no -- i 'm sorry .
apparently not . do n't you know where it is ?
did n't you take it with you ?
yes , my bag !
your bag ?
well , he was in the navy .
you should have more self-control . you were in the army .
because i hate him -- because i love you !
then why did you do it ?
that 's true .
but you 're the more intelligent one .
he started it .
you should be ashamed of yourselves . two men of your standing , always quarreling .
an hour , two at most .
how much time ?
the pumps buy you time ... but minutes only . from this moment , no matter what we do , titanic will founder .
the pumps --
five compartments . she can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached . but not five . not five . as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads ... at e deck ... from one to the next ... back and back . there 's no stopping it .
that 's right .
water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes ... in the forepeak ... in all three holds ... and in boiler room six .
and to you , mr. andrews .
good luck to you , rose .
i 'm sorry that i did n't build you a stronger ship , young rose .
wo n't you even make a try for it , mr. andrews ?
hurry , rose .
bottom , left , right . i have it .
take the elevator to the very bottom , go left , down the crewman 's passage , then make a right .
no ! i 'll do this with or without your help , sir . but without will take longer .
what ? you have to get to a boat right away !
mr. andrews , thank god ! where would the master at arms take someone under arrest ? !
yes , i understand . thank you .
please tell only who you must , i do n't want to be responsible for a panic . and get to a boat quickly . do n't wait . you remember what i told you about the boats ?
yes . in an hour or so ... all this ... will be at the bottom of the atlantic .
you 're certain ?
the ship will sink .
i saw the iceberg , mr. andrews . and i see it in your eyes . please tell me the truth .
about half , actually . rose , you miss nothing , do you ? in fact , i put in these new type davits , which can take an extra row of boats here . but it was thought ... by some ... that the deck would look too cluttered . so i was over-ruled .
mr. andrews , i did the sum in my head , and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned ... forgive me , but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard .
thank you , rose .
your ship is a wonder , mr. andrews . truly .
it 's hers , you schmuck . look , rose , i ... i do n't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the titanic when it 's not sinking , and jumps back onto it when it is ... we 're not dealing with logic here , i know that ... but please ... think about this a second .
rush her .
do n't drop it rose .
holy shit .
lewis ...
so let me get this right . you were gon na kill yourself by jumping off the titanic ? that 's great !
rose might not want to see this , lewis .
we 've put together the world 's largest database on the titanic . okay , here ...
okay , so she 's a very old goddamned liar . i traced her as far back as the 20 's ... she was working as an actress in l.a. an actress . her name was rose dawson . then she married a guy named calvert , moved to cedar rapids , had two kids . now calvert 's dead , and from what i 've heard cedar rapids is dead .
a hundred and one next month .
she says she 's rose dewitt bukater , right ? rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic . at the age of 17. if she'd 've lived , she 'd be over a hundred now .
get that outta my face .
you know , boss , this happened to geraldo and his career never recovered .
shit .
you are , lewis . you rolling ?
who 's the best ? say it .
i 'm tryin ' boss .
stay off the floor . do n't stir it up like you did yesterday .
i 'm in the sitting room . heading for bedroom b-54 .
look , brock , she 's going to do this her way , in her own time . do n't forget , she contacted you . she 's out here for her own reasons , god knows what they are .
that 's the shape my hand 's gon na be when i hold that thing . you understand ? i 'm not leaving here without it .
what ?
lizzy ... you got ta understand something . i 've bet it all to find the heart of the ocean . i 've got all my dough tied up in this thing . my wife even divorced me over this hunt . i need what 's locked inside your grandma 's memory . you see this ? right here ?
i 'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother . i came down here to tell you to back off .
look , i 'm running out of time . i need your help .
do n't you mean work me ?
hey , lizzy . i need to talk to you for a second .
alright . you have my attention , rose . can you tell me who the woman in the picture is ?
i told you you wanted to take this call .
... mrs. calvert ?
rose calvert .
this is brock lovett . what can i do for you , mrs ... ?
no , trust me , you want to take this call .
bobby , we 're launching . see these submersibles here , going in the water ? take a message .
there 's a satellite call for you .
how it 's going ? it 's going like a first date in prison , whattaya think ? !
the partners want to know how it 's going ?
i put the diamond in my coat pocket . and i put my coat ... on her .
what could possible be funny ?
there are still some boats forward . stay with this one ... murdoch . he seems to be quite ... practical .
we 're too late .
so do i .
i make my own luck .
then that 's our play . but we 're still going to need some insurance . come on .
the one on the other side is letting men in .
we 're running out of time . and this strutting martinet ... ... is n't letting any men in at all .
she 's not on the starboard side either .
this is ridiculous , lovejoy . find her .
none of the stewards have seen her .
there 's no need for language , mr. hockley . go back and turn the heater on in my room , so it wo n't be too cold when we get back .
it 's just the god damned english doing everything by the book .
she knows .
you know i do n't like that , rose .
all part of my charm , ruth . at any rate , it was my darling fiancee 's beauty rituals which made us late .
honestly , cal , if you were n't forever booking everything at the last instant , we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family .
steerage swine . apparently missed his annual bath .
it is unsinkable . god himself could n't sink this ship .
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable .
your daughter is much too hard to impress , ruth . mind your step .
jewels are precious . goodbye , mr. hockley .
you 're precious to me , rose .
tell her that her daughter died with the titanic .
what do i tell your mother ?
is this in any way unclear ?
rose ... your mother and i have been looking for you --
yes , i lived . how awkward for you .
i 'd rather be his whore than your wife .
where are you going ? to him ? is that it ? to be a whore to that gutter rat ?
not the better half .
oh , mother shut up ! do n't you understand ? the water is freezing and there are n't enough boats ... not enough by half . half the people on this ship are going to die .
maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on .
but i was with him the whole time .
that 's right . two things dear to me have disappeared this evening . now that one is back ... ... i have a pretty good idea where to find the other . search him .
something serious has happened .
i 'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command ! i am your fiancee --
you will never behave like that again ! do you understand ?
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me .
yes . your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting .
i was tired .
i had hoped you would come to me last night .
the heart of the ocean . cal , it 's ... it 's overwhelming .
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth . they call it le coeur de la mer , the --
diamond . yes it is . 56 carats .
my god ... cal . is it a --
rose is displeased . mmm ... what to do ?
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love ?
you wanted to see the propellers ?
i was leaning way over , to see the ... ah ... propellers . and i slipped and i would have gone overboard ... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself .
it was ... stupid really . i was leaning over and i slipped .
an accident ? !
cal , stop ! it was an accident .
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee ? ! look at me , you filth ! what did you think you were doing ? !
he 'll never amount to a thing , trust me . at least they were cheap .
you 're wrong . they 're fascinating . like in a dream ... there 's truth without logic . what 's his name again ... ? picasso .
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money .
i felt like black .
i could n't let you wear black on sailing day , sweetpea . it 's bad luck .
you told me to change .
i always win , jack . one way or another . pity i did n't keep that drawing . it 's going to be worth a lot more by morning .
almost as good as you .
you 're a good liar .
get in ... hurry up , it 's almost full .
i 'll be alright . hurry up so we can get going ... we got our own boat to catch .
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in . jack and i can get off safely . both of us .
probably best . it 'll be all business and politics , that sort of thing . would n't interest you . good of you to come .
no thanks . i 'm heading back .
no caviar for me , thanks . never did like it much .
just a soupcon of lemon ... ... it improves the flavor with champagne .
can i bum a cigarette ?
this should be amusing .
good . settled then .
sure . count me in .
i know . perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow , to regale our group with your heroic tale ?
we got ta get up there or we 're gon na be gargling saltwater . where 's tommy ?
the boats are all going .
i do n't know what she 's say , she do n't know what i say , so we get along fine .
how you two doin ' ?
of course not . that 's not the point . goodbye ! goodbye ! ! i 'll miss you !
you know somebody ?
you see ? is my destinio ! ! like i told you . i go to l'america ! ! to be a millionaire ! ! capito ? ? i go to america ! !
goin ' home ... to the land o ' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs ! on the titanic ! ! we 're ridin ' in high style now ! we 're practically goddamned royalty , ragazzo mio ! !
porca madonna ! ! yeeaaaaa ! ! !
'cause you 're goin ' to america ! ! full house boys !
sorry , you 're not gon na see your mama again for a long time ...
what sorry ? what you got ? you lose my money ? ? ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
let 's see ... fabrizio 's got niente . olaf , you 've got squat . sven , uh oh ... two pair ... mmm . sorry fabrizio .
smell ice , can you ? bleedin ' christ !
oy , mate ... that was a close shave .
well if that 's what it takes for us two to get warm , i 'd rather not , if it 's all the same .
they 're a bloody sight warmer than we are .
cor ... look at that , would ya .
well i can .
bollocks .
you can smell ice , you know , when it 's near .
if you do n't shut that hole in yer face , there 'll be one less in this boat !
i do n't understand a one of you . what 's the matter with you ? it 's your men back there ! we got plenty a ' room for more .
aw knock it off , yer scarin ' me . come on girls , grab your oars . let 's go . well come on !
they 'll pull us right down i tell ya !
no ! it 's our lives now , not theirs . and i 'm in charge of this boat ! now row ! !
we got room for lots more . i say we go back .
the suction will pull us right down if we do n't keep going .
ai n't you boys ever rowed before ? here , gim me those oars . i 'll show ya how it 's done .
keep pulling ... away from the ship . pull .
excuse me .
well , do you think the ship is seriously damaged ?
we 've struck ice .
why have we stopped ?
of course i leave it to your good offices to decide what 's best , but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into new york tuesday night and surprise them all . retire with a bang , eh , e.j . ?
i prefer not to push the engines until they 've been properly run in .
captain , the press knows the size of titanic , let them marvel at her speed too . we must give them something new to print . and the maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines !
no , but we 're making excellent time .
so you 've not lit the last four boilers then ?
i promise . i will never let go , jack . i 'll never let go .
never let go .
i promise .
you must do me this honor ... promise me you will survive ... that you will never give up ... no matter what happens ... no matter how hopeless ... promise me now , and never let go of that promise .
rose , listen to me . listen . winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me .
i ca n't feel my body .
you 're going to get out of this ... you 're going to go on and you 're going to make babies and watch them grow and you 're going to die an old lady , warm in your bed . not here . not this night . do you understand me ?
i 'm so cold .
no ... do n't say your good-byes , rose . do n't you give up . do n't do it .
just a few more minutes . it 'll take them a while to get the boats organized ...
it 's getting quiet .
i know . i know . help me , here . look around .
it 's so cold .
look for something floating . some debris ... wood ... anything .
right .
you jump , i jump , right ?
get in the boat , rose .
i 'm not going without you .
we 'll find out .
will this work ?
i 'll wait here .
i 'll be right back .
you have to go for help .
i did n't . i just realized i already knew .
so ... how did you find out i did n't do it ?
see if you can find a key for these . try those drawers . it 's a little brass one .
i know , i know .
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket .
he could n't have .
do n't you believe it , rose . do n't !
cal , you ca n't be serious ! we 're in the middle of an emergency and you --
this is horseshit .
right .
come with me , jack . i jump , you jump ... right ?
now it 's worse .
we have to tell mother and cal .
it 's bad .
it did n't seem like much of a bump . i 'm sure we 're okay .
could it have damaged the ship ?
looks okay . i do n't see anything .
i know . it does n't make any sense . that 's why i trust it .
this is crazy .
when this ship docks , i 'm getting off with you .
it 's okay . i 'm alright .
you 're trembling .
au contraire , mon cher .
are you nervous ?
to the stars .
where to , miss ?
kinda like we 're doin ' right now -- uh oh !
he 's an ex-pinkerton . cal 's father hired him to keep cal out of trouble ... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch , after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town ...
pretty tough for a valet , this fella .
he does landscapes .
i believe you are blushing , mr. big artiste . i ca n't imagine monsieur monet blushing .
a diamond . a very rare diamond , called the heart of the ocean .
what is it ? a sapphire ?
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out .
should i be expecting him anytime soon ?
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere .
zat is true , i am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions . hey ... monet !
will this light do ? do n't artists need good light ?
sssshh . come here .
fabrizio said you might be up --
i have to get back , they 'll miss me . please , jack , for both our sakes , leave me alone .
you 're right . only you can do that .
it 's not up to you to save me , jack .
i do n't think so . they 've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly , and you 're goin ' to die if you do n't break out . maybe not right away , 'cause you 're strong . but sooner or later the fire in you is goin ' to go out .
you 're making this very hard . i 'll be fine . really .
no wait . let me try to get this out . you 're amazing ... and i know i have nothing to offer you , rose . i know that . but i 'm involved now . you jump , i jump , remember ? i ca n't turn away without knowin ' that you 're goin ' to be alright .
jack , i --
rose , you 're no picnic ... you 're a spoiled little brat even , but under that you 're a strong , pure heart , and you 're the most amazingly astounding girl i 've ever known and --
i like that . are n't we supposed to wish on it ?
that was a long one . my father used to say that whenever you saw one , it was a soul going to heaven .
i did , did n't i ? look ! a shooting star .
uh huh . you got mailed to the wrong address .
a mistake ?
you 're not one of them . there 's been a mistake .
just move with me . do n't think .
i do n't know the steps .
you 're still my best girl , cora .
may i cut in , miss ?
time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin .
jack , must you go ?
cal , surely you remember mr. dawson .
i saw that in a nickelodeon once , and i always wanted to do it .
they did n't teach you that in finishing school ? here , it 's easy . watch closely .
i think i would . and teach me to spit too . like a man . why should only men be able to spit . it 's unfair .
sure . if you like .
you mean one leg on each side ? scandalous ! can you show me ?
alright , we 're going . we 'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we 'll ride horses on the beach ... right in the surf ... but you have to ride like a cowboy , none of that side-saddle stuff .
why ca n't i be like you jack ? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it . say we 'll go there , sometime ... to that pier ... even if we only ever just talk about it .
yeah ; it was great money ... i could make a dollar a day , sometimes . but only in summer . when it got cold , i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing .
a whole ten cents ? !
well , then logging got to be too much like work , so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica . that 's a swell place , they even have a rollercoaster . i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece .
so then what , mr. wandering jack ?
well , alright . there 's something in me , jack . i feel it . i do n't know what it is , whether i should be an artist , or , i do n't know ... a dancer . like isadora duncan ... . a wild pagan spirit ...
i 'm sorry . really ... i am .
listen , buster ... i hate caviar ! and i 'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head .
you would n't last two days . there 's no hot water , and hardly ever any caviar .
you know , my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist ... living in a garret , poor but free !
you wouldn'ta jumped .
and ... ?
i see you .
you have a gift , jack . you do . you see people .
no , no ! just with her hands .
i think you must have had a love affair with her ...
she had beautiful hands .
you liked this woman . you used her several times .
yup . that 's one of the great things about paris . lots of girls willing take their clothes off .
and these were drawn from life ?
well , they did n't think too much of 'em in paree .
oh no ! oh , i 'm so sorry . truly !
well , they did n't think too much of 'em in paree .
jack , these are quite good ! really , they are .
may i ?
just some sketches .
what 's this ?
well , i guess i will tonight .
oh , jack ... please do n't judge me until you 've seen my world .
it is that simple .
if only it were that simple .
so do n't marry him .
yes , exactly !
so you feel like you 're stuck on a train you ca n't get off 'cause you 're marryin ' this fella .
worse i 'm afraid .
is he your boyfriend ?
penguin ? oh , cal ! he is them .
that penguin last night , is he one of them ?
oh god , i am such an utter fool .
uh huh . they 'll be sorry . 'course you 'll be dead .
i do n't ... it was n't just one thing . it was everything . it was them , it was their whole world . and i was trapped in it , like an insect in amber . i just had to get away ... just run and run and run ... and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship ... even the titanic was n't big enough . not enough to get away from them . and before i 'd really though about it , i was over the rail . i was so furious . i 'll show them . they 'll be sorry !
that 's not what i was thinking . what i was thinking was ... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out .
look , i know what you must be thinking ! poor little rich girl . what does she know about misery ?
you 're welcome . rose .
here i am . i ... i want to thank you for what you did . not just for ... for pulling me back . but for your discretion .
well , here you are .
jack ... i feel like such an idiot . it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you .
jack .
mr. dawson , i --
that 's quite a moniker . i may hafta get you to write that down .
rose . rose dewitt bukater .
so , you got a name by the way ?
uh , yes . of course . after you .
could i speak to you in private ?
hello again .
i 've got you . i wo n't let go .
help ! help ! !
pleased to meet you , mr. dawson .
i 'm jack dawson .
that 's what everybody says . but with all due respect , i 'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship .
you 're crazy .
sorry . just ... you look like kind of an indoor girl . anyway , i went through some thin ice and i 'm tellin ' ya , water that cold ... like that right down there ... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body . you ca n't breath , you ca n't think ... least not about anything but the pain . which is why i 'm not looking forward to jumping in after you . but like i said , i do n't see a choice . i guess i 'm kinda hoping you 'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here .
i know what ice fishing is !
well they have some of the coldest winters around , and i grew up there , near chippewa falls . once when i was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on lake wissota ... ice- fishing 's where you chop a hole in the --
no .
ever been to wisconsin ?
freezing . maybe a couple degrees over .
how cold ?
it would hurt . i 'm not saying it would n't . to be honest i 'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold .
the fall alone would kill you .
do n't be absurd . you 'll be killed .
i ca n't . i 'm involved now . if you let go i have to jump in after you .
you 're distracting me . go away .
you would have done it already . now come on , take my hand .
what do you mean no i wo n't ? do n't presume to tell me what i will and will not do . you do n't know me .
no you wo n't .
no ! stay where you are . i mean it . i 'll let go .
take my hand . i 'll pull you back in .
and wake me , of course , if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful .
yes sir .
mmmmm . well , i 'm off . maintain speed and heading , mr. lightoller .
it 's make the bergs harder to see , with no breaking water at the base .
yes , like a mill pond . not a breath of wind .
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a flat calm , in 24 years at sea .
we were pissin ' in the wind the whole time .
i 'm sorry .
oh , yeah . yeah , i 'm a believer . she was there .
you think she was really there ?
then we 're all meeting your grandmother for the first time .
what past ? she has never once , not once , ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago .
maybe she wants to make peace with the past .
that 's enough .
wait ! can you give us something go on , here . like who had access to the safe . what about this lovejoy guy ? the valet . did he have the combination ?
if your grandma is who she says she is , she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank . and that makes you my new best friend . i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery .
april 14 , 1912 .
you had it the entire time ? !
do n't come any closer .
i 'm afraid i 'm feeling a little tired , mr. lovett .
rose , tell us more about the diamond . what did hockley do with it after that ?
well , that 's the general idea , my dear .
i can still feel its weight . if you could have felt it , not just seen it ...
it 's been 84 years ... and i can still smell the fresh paint . the china had never been used . the sheets had never been slept in .
just tell us what you can --
it 's been 84 years ...
nathan hockley , right . pittsburgh steel tycoon . for a diamond necklace his son caledon hockley bought in france for his fiancee ... you ... a week before he sailed on titanic . and the claim was filed right after the sinking . so the diamond had to 've gone down with the ship . see the date ?
someone named hockley , i should imagine .
i tracked it down through insurance records ... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy . do you know who the claiment was , rose ?
it was a dreadful , heavy thing . i only wore it this once .
louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone , called the blue diamond of the crown , which disappeared in 1792 , about the time louis lost everything from the neck up . the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too ... recut into a heart-like shape ... and it became le coeur de la mer . the heart of the ocean . today it would be worth more than the hope diamond .
i should like to see my drawing .
would you like anything ?
there , that 's nice . i have to have my pictures when i travel . and freddy of course . is n't that right , sweetie .
yes . very nice . have you met my granddaughter , lizzy ? she takes care of me .
is your stateroom alright ?
goodbye , mother .
rose , get in the boat !
of course it 's unfair ! we 're women . our choices are never easy .
it 's so unfair .
do you want to se me working as a seamstress ? is that what you want ? do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction , our memories scattered to the winds ? my god , rose , how can you be so selfish ?
how can you put this on my shoulders ?
i do n't understand you . it is a fine match with hockley , and it will insure our survival .
your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name . and that name is the only card we have to play .
of course i know it 's gone . you remind me every day !
rose , this is not a game ! our situation is precarious . you know the money 's gone !
charmed , i 'm sure .
mother , may i introduce jack dawson .
excuse me .
my god , rose , what 's gotten into --
no , darling , lip rouge -- all over your mouth .
baloney !
i like touching you -- poison ivy . you 'd just been kissing that girl when i came in , had n't you ?
will you leave me alone ?
and when you do i 'll convey your respects by wireless to herbert . take it easy , lee -- no other woman 'll ever get you . at least i 'm honest when i tell you there must be something pretty low down in me -- because i like you . you 're such a swine !
-- and i can tell you where to get off .
oh -- a hundred times --
i did n't ask you to come away with me --
just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her .
you mind your own business ! she 's an old friend of mine and i like her -- what 're you going to do about it ?
did you muss up her hair by accident , too ?
do n't talk such bunk ! she 's one of the acts on the ship . i just ran into her by accident .
do n't look so uncomfortable , lee -- it interferes with your good looks . give me a cigarette . what did you do -- persuade her to come on this voyage with you ?
sure ! you 're never at a loss for words .
i can explain --
so that 's your little dancer that you were playing around with in new york . oh -- there 's no accounting for tastes -- mine , too , seem to be in the gutter .
and < u > do < /u > bring miss marsh -- -- when she 's had time to tidy up a bit .
i 'll join you later .
well -- shall we go into dinner ?
yes -- i met miss marsh . in fact , she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances . what 's the matter , miss marsh -- are n't you feeling well ?
this is miss marsh .
hope we 're not intruding .
i 'm sorry , but you three men can play poker or something . shall i see you tomorrow ?
but , anya , dear ! unless you play we wo n't have a fourth .
that 's fine -- because you 're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life .
do n't be crazy -- i 'm tickled to death to see you .
here 's to europe ! could n't try to look a little less glum , could you ?
i never want to go back ... .
sure !
when i found out you were going i just had an attack of nerves -- a few tears -- and herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... i 'm here with you ... and that 's all that matters to me .
how 'd you ever get away with it ?
you 're a charming liar . you < u > know < /u > , herbert 's too dull to be suspicious about anything -- even when i suddenly decided to come to europe at a few hours ' notice --
i had an idea your husband was getting suspicious .
it would be a nice change from you .
do you want the truth , anya ?
then why the sudden exit without even telling me ?
i was n't running out on you . when i got over there -- made my plans -- i 'd have sent for you .
any woman 's crazy to feel about a man the way i do about you .
anya , i think you 're crazy .
do n't you hate people that surprise you ? ... i do . we ca n't stand here .
anya !
why worry ? it was insured -- how about that swimming lesson i promised you ?
no -- i 'm furious ! -- nobody seems to do anything about it --
yes -- and < u > very < /u > popular --
is n't she lovely ?
thanks .
we 'll save you a place at our table .
will you please excuse me ? i 'll be right back .
that 's a date .
i hope so .
glad to see you again .
good afternoon --
sooner -- if you like . see you again , i hope .
thanks . i 'll be there . about seven-thirty ?
yes , yes -- the air -- -- i 'm getting plenty of air . miss marsh -- mrs. rosson .
feeling a little better , i see .
i 'm just commencing to enjoy this trip .
i can think of nothing nicer . it 's very kind of you to invite me --
i think you do .
i do n't understand .
you were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening -- -- and he was gentleman enough to boast < u > why < /u > you 'd been there and show me a snapshot of you .
sorry i ca n't return the compliment .
you 're anya rosson , are n't you ? i 've heard of you back in new york .
thanks , no . i despise any form of exercise . do n't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards .
how do you do . would you care to finish the game ? i have a slight earache . -- and it 's so noisy up here .
where 's lother ?
no-o !
no ! -- did < u > you < /u > take that bracelet ?
did you find it ?
i 'm going down to my cabin . i have to send a wireless -- see you later .
you 're lucky -- out my way , in montana , there 's nothing else to do --
< u > gladly < /u > .
will you pardon me ?
well , it 'll have to be poker -- but i 'm so unlucky in that game .
you 'll excuse me .
is n't that interesting ?
-- that 's what we call double-a grade lumber , ma'am ; you do n't find a knot in a thousand feet .
lumber , ma'am -- spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance -- -- and now gosh darn it -- '' honest jack '' -- that 's what they call me -- is goin ' to see the world .
montana ?
a rare pleasure to meet you , ma'am ! where i come from -- out in montana -- we have some pretty women , but i guess if you walked down main street they 'd turn out the fire brigade .
get moving --
guess again , copper .
is that why you killed lee lother ?
stick-up . needed dough to get ashore .
what did you want a gun for ?
lifted it out of a guy 's cabin last night .
where 'd you get it ?
i 'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em -- why , a high-school kid could take you saps -- and another thing -- lay off sally marsh . -- '' honest jack '' ! one look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets .
and i 'll lay odds you got that bracelet .
i 'm making it to you . if i do n't get it by tonight -- you 'll find it a < u > rough < /u > voyage .
oh , no -- i played with < u > your < /u > cards -- in < u > your < /u > cabin -- at < u > your < /u > suggestion -- if you 've got a kick coming , make it to the purser .
in that case -- you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars .
i agree with you -- no gentleman , would -- but i would -- -- especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards .
no gentleman would do that .
sure ! excuse me .
could i see you a minute ?
fine -- i 'll be glad to .
how about a little game later ?
that depends on how mother 's feeling . you 'll excuse me , gentlemen ?
you 're coming back --
and me coming in with two pair --
aces full .
i 'll bet a couple of hundred .
i should pass , but i 'll trail along -- i 'll take three .
if i ever won a pot that large the boat would sink .
well , i 'm off to a pretty good start .
not at all .
we have n't any chips , mr. brett -- do you mind playing with cash ?
we 'll be expecting you .
hmm ! so am i. if you 'll excuse me i have some important unfinished business . i 'll see you all later .
what 's the matter ?
well , i 'll be -- ! ! !
jimmy !
i 'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences .
i 'll be waiting on deck .
seven-fifty . positively my last offer .
make it five .
i 'll change and be with you in ten minutes .
come on -- let 's take a swim .
i 'm beginning to think you 're a pretty swell guy .
you ca n't lose me , sally -- i 'm no lily myself !
he 's a con man -- crooked as a tree -- and i was part of the racket -- helped him ! now -- if you have an appointment elsewhere -- i 'll excuse you !
you can live that down , ca n't you ?
too much -- remember -- i warned you about me -- i used to be lee lother 's girl --
what do you know about them ?
that was the come-on -- promise me you wo n't play with them again --
lose ? -- i won a little --
oh , you infant ! how much did you lose ?
a mr. summers and a man called lother .
who with ?
just met her on the boat -- supposed to play bridge with her yesterday -- but she would n't -- so we played poker instead .
how well do you know her ?
yes -- i remember --
oh , that 's mrs. rosson -- remember , you met her yesterday ?
i could see you were pining away --
good night , idiot !
good night , mrs. brett !
i think we ought to walk .
i 'll give you plenty of rings as soon as i get the stones set -- what do you think ?
you 're a little ahead of yourself -- the usual routine would be for you to propose , and if i accept , then you 'd give me an engagement ring --
you did n't ? -- i guess i forgot to tell you --
i did n't < u > know < /u > we were < u > going < /u > to be married .
i think we 'll live in europe after we 're married ?
what ? --
yes -- you know what i 've been thinking , sally ? --
what , again ?
we 'll let it go at that --
lonesome ?
this time i 'm really glad you showed up .
yes -- is it all right if i come like this ?
would you like to take a turn around the deck with me ?
you said it ! how about a little action ?
do n't let 's talk about it .
you mean that ?
let 's forget it -- ca n't you see i kind of like you , too ... and i do n't want to get involved .
sally -- !
-- i know what i 'm talking about . i 'm no high-school girl looking through a window -- reaching for the moon . guess i 'll be going .
but --
will you take some advice ? if you 're looking for romance -- count me out -- -- if you know what 's good for you .
for once i 'm dead on the level -- -- crazy about you !
do n't kid me . i 'm in no mood for it .
you do n't know anything about me . if you did , you probably would n't be here .
i ca n't blame the ocean -- it 's you .
that 's funny -- so was i. guess the ocean makes one sentimental
a lot of things i 'd like to forget .
what are you thinking ?
decent ? i guess any guy could be decent -- if you were interested .
mighty decent of you , pal .
anything i can do ? i 'd jump overboard if it 'd help you .
thanks .
sorry .
a little .
i must say you 're persistent -- -- it 's kind of flattering .
you 're forgiven if you do n't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage .
i 'm sorry i 'm late , but something happened .
i 'll be there -- good-by .
see you at seven-thirty in the lounge .
wrong again -- but i dislike possessive women .
fatal fascination of james brett wins out .
okay .
sooner it you like .
at seven-thirty ?
when ?
but i 'll have cocktails with you .
do n't rub it in .
well , i ca n't .
yes ?
you asked me to dine with you tonight .
do n't be a c-a-t .
very -- your mother ?
is n't she attractive ?
-- you want to adopt him ! -- good for you !
a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and --
tell me .
what a horrible death ! do you know what you remind me of ?
i want you to get used to my voice -- you 're going to hear it a lot .
nothing to speak of . what is this -- third degree ?
married ?
keep your eyes on the ball , mister .
you know , you 're not a < u > bad < /u > -looking girl . in fact -- i think you 're lovely .
even cupid 's becoming modern , using medicine balls instead of darts .
you < u > are < /u > a lunatic !
do n't stop , nurse -- i think i 'm going to faint .
mr denby and mr. mckinney .
brett is the name .
this is mr. -- er --
well -- breakfast ? lunch ?
never eat before the show .
aw -- give a feller a break . my cards are on the table -- i want to know you . how about dining with me tonight ?
you work too fast for me , young man .
oh , yes , i am , because < u > afterwards < /u > -- up here in the moonlight .
you 're not very ambitious , are you ?
this is great . i 'll be able to watch your act every night .
have we ? -- well , i 'd just as soon play shuffle-board .
-- sorry -- got an appointment to play shuffle-board .
there 's soft music --
good-by !
wait a minute ! -- they 're dancing in the palm court --
good-by .
how about giving me another coat ?
so you washed it off !
do n't thank me . do you recognize me without the lipstick ?
oh -- hello ! i got the flowers . that was sweet of you -- thank you .
where have you been hiding ?
no ! do n't touch it ! i want the < u > world < /u > to see my < u > shame < /u > .
-- you 'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you -- -- let me wipe it off .
i could stand some more --
you 've got lipstick all over you .
very much --
like her paint job ?
yes --
nice lines --
i 'll say she is !
she looks like a lot of other boats . i grant you she 's beautiful .
i would n't miss this boat for a million .
yes -- are you ?
i 'd < u > like < /u > to be . sailing on the < u > progress ? < /u >
i thought you were one of my friends .
want to take it back ?
i 'm so sorry !
get it !
on the drunk .
where did you hide it ?
why -- i -- er thought with all this heat turned on i 'd hide it .
listen , runt -- quick ! where 's the ice ?
hello , jimmy . what 's up ?
see you later , shortie -- i 'm off to the pool .
say -- wait a minute !
sure ! mckinney will never suspect you --
< u > me < /u > !
you keep it --
sure -- and to show you i 'm a regular fella -- here 's that twenty-five hundred .
partners , ai n't we ?
about sixteen hundred .
oh , is she ? what a shame ! you 'll pardon me ?
your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away .
what is it ?
sorry to interrupt you , mr brett , but i have a message for you .
i 'll take one .
thank you , sir .
thank you . i owe you a dollar forty -- here -- keep the change .
here 's your twenty-five hundred , mr. brett .
yes , mr. brett -- right away .
have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check -- and bring the cash here .
that 's where you come in . now , listen , shortie --
well , if that 's the case , you 're sure of winning the first couple of hands -- but what about after that ?
they wo n't squawk -- they 're professionals .
well , i had to get some dough to play with those suckers . here , get this changed .
you take some awful chances .
here -- drop it where they 'll find it and return it to him . he 's not a bad egg . i 'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive .
you know where that sense of humor 's goin ' to get you one of these days --
i fell in his arms -- could n't resist it .
are you screwy ?
inspector mckinney .
now you 're talkin ' !
right ! -- but it does n't have to apply to you -- keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office .
pleasure first if it do n't interfere with business .
shortie ! -- you know my motto ?
a dollar forty -- out of the two dollars i gave you .
change ?
my change .
no , sir ?
just a minute , steward -- have n't you forgotten something ?
why < u > did n't < /u > i think of that ? -- i am going to scout around and see if i can find her .
maybe she 's in the show -- one of the troupers -- did you ever think of that ?
she was wearing a white dress with a cute , black hat -- and carrying a bag with s. m. on it . funny -- her name 's not on the passenger list .
this is a business trip !
a thousand ? she 's one in a million -- right off the top of the rosebush !
-- there 's thousands of 'em !
oh , shortie ! -- -- there 's a girl on this ship --
do n't let money spoil a beautiful friendship . look at these here telegrams to be delivered ! this ai n't a job -- it 's a marathon .
is that a nice way to talk to a pal ?
until then -- the dollar forty stays with me .
come on -- i 'll promote a card game , and we 'll be sitting pretty .
not a chance .
i 'll need it -- gave my last buck to the bedroom steward .
a dollar forty .
how 're the tips ?
yeah -- but high livin 's made me soft .
stop squawking ! you were doing this job on a ship four years ago when i first picked you up , were n't you ?
yer lucky i 'm here at all . i tell you , jimmy -- my feet 'll never hold out .
looks like he 's taking a trip -- see the baggage ? the only time they ever picked me up , mckinney walked through the room while they were grilling -- let 's see how good his memory is .
you do n't think -- ?
shortie , look !
you 're a wise guy -- gim me back --
oh , no -- you 're not gon na give my hard-earned money away .
quick , let me have that money . i 'm broke and i 'll need it for tips .
i 'll watch for him , sir .
he 's a colored man in chauffeur 's uniform carrying a basket of fruit .
yes , sir ! -- i will , sir -- certainly , sir !
nix , the law !
i 'll give you half of it . here 's seventy cents .
no , you 're not . give me that dollar seventy .
a dollar seventy and i 'm gon na keep it !
it 'll never hurt you -- -got any money ?
oh , i 'm not squawkin ' , but i 'm not used to working and it 's a bad habit to get into .
no bank roll there , boy . lucky i could get you signed on -- they picked up that pittsburgh jeweler -- made him talk . the heat 's on , shortie -- and those atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome .
we coulda got two third-class !
we did n't have enough dough for two tickets , did we ?
if i was smart i would n't be working my way over on this ship .
i thought you were a smart guy .
oh , putting on the swell , eh ?
do n't you know better than to talk to me with people around ?
not here -- follow me around the shed .
make it three , boys -- i 'll play this hand pat .
that goes two ways .
think again --
i thought you were a sucker --
why is n't that a good time to quit ?
why , you would n't quit when you 're ahead , would you ?
well , to tell you the truth , gentlemen , i 've sworn off playing poker .
much better -- thank you --
how 's your mother feeling ?
it 's a pleasure .
it 's your deal .
that beats two pairs . i 'm glad < u > i < /u > did n't win the first pot . take the money , mr. brett .
three jacks .
do n't worry about that . we 'll settle after the hand . out in montana where i come from a man 's word is all that 's necessary . what have you got ?
i 'll bet a couple of hundred -- i wonder what 's keeping that boy .
hope i did n't keep you waiting .
come in !
thanks . that makes us square .
here 's your fifty .
why , i --
mmmmmmmmmhm ... . now , jimmy , what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired ?
you keep out of this -- you admit you thought of killing him -- how were you going to do it ?
do n't get yourself all worked up --
do n't be too smart , jimmy -- you 're out in the rough yourself . you had an argument with lother a couple of hours before he was killed -- but i 'll deal with that later --
thought you might need me -- do n't talk , kid , and do n't let him scare you --
anybody that 's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back .
nice girl , that -- i 'd hate to see < u > her < /u > get a raw deal . you know , the great trouble with crooks is they 're < u > too < /u > smart . now if i 'd taken that bracelet , i 'd find some way to slip it back -- i 'd know i could never get ashore with it .
it 's a bet -- come on , sally !
would n't bet against her . tell you what i will do -- bet you i find that bracelet before we hit france . not a hundred , though -- just fifty .
nooooo ! -- going to catch up on my reading . i 'll take this one .
coming to the pool for a swim ?
hello , young fellow !
then we run our hands down a man 's arms and legs -- like this -- in case they got what you 're looking for attached to a string . see what i mean , purser ?
hey ! -- you 're tickling me .
this has nothing to do with me -- but always remember , purser , when you 're searching anybody , take the lining of their coat , like this -- -- run your fingers all along these seams ... . then -- back of the collar -- < u > here < /u > -- that used to be a favorite trick -- and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe -- like this .
how about trying your fine italian hand ?
it 's easy to see the purser has n't had much practice .
swell !
i 'll go with you .
sure , i 'll go .
well , someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of mrs. rosson 's cabin this evening -- even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched . get me ?
why ?
you know what i 'd do , if i were you -- before the card game i 'd go to the purser 's office .
no , thanks . i 've promised to play cards .
how about you ?
nervous . could n't sleep . feel like a nightcap ?
thought you were going to turn in , inspector .
good night !
no , thanks -- i 'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in --
i would n't worry about it -- it 'll turn up -- how about a nightcap , inspector ?
i would n't be surprised --
if he lets you down i 'll try my hand at sleuthing -- bet i could find that bracelet --
sorry -- but i 'm on a vacation --
it 'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this , inspector --
some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships --
this is exciting -- but if it 's been stolen they ca n't get away with it on a ship --
no , thanks -- i never gambled in my life .
care to join us ?
i 'll go with you --
i 'm going to the show --
no -- not quite .
yours , too . are you the mckinney , the dentist on calumet avenue in chicago ?
before that . your face is very familiar .
oh , yes . on the pier .
i think i 've met you before , mr. brett .
if you had n't agreed -- i was going to throw you overboard --
what 's that ?
o.k. , kid -- i 'm only sorry for one thing .
very clear . that 's one favor i 'll be glad to do you .
yes -- but do n't ask me why -- because i could never tell you . i do n't know what most guys want out of life -- but < u > that < /u > would be enough for me -- i would n't care about -- easy money -- or -- showing off my smart brains -- i 'd just like to live < u > my < /u > life so nothing i did would bounce back and ruin < u > hers < /u > -- do i make myself clear ?
she did ?
i wo n't -- i 'll ask for one right now . sally tells me she 's in love with you .
good ! at last you 're making yourself useful . so long !
i should say not .
i do n't know what it is , but i wo n't use it . is she entertaining you ?
i would -- but our rehearsal starts right away . before i go i want to ask you a little favor . sally is an important part of my show . some day -- not now -- when you get a chance -- let her come to just one rehearsal . i 'll appreciate it .
she was to meet me here -- why do n't you wait ? she ought to be here any minute .
no -- i 'm looking for miss marsh myself . i thought you might know where she is --
oh , denby -- have you seen sally around ?
never mind -- i 'll pay for it now . it 'll save time .
wait a minute -- let 's match for it .
that 's all right . i 'll attend to this .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i 'm o.k . it did n't hurt much .
that 's too bad .
o.k . heads you win .
tell you what i 'll do . i 'll toss you for her -- heads she plays with me .
no -- i 'll take sally and give you the best of it .
now that that 's settled , why not make the game a foursome ?
their faces are familiar -- but not to each other .
well . i 'd rather see < u > you < /u > get it than the company .
well , there 's no use in sending it . see that -- i saved you seven twenty !
sure .
just a minute -- your wife knows her own name , does n't she ?
o.k. ! send that !
that 's great ! there 's the address and message all in one word .
june ? that 's my wife 's name .
fine ! instead of saying `` next month '' -- we 'll use one word and say `` june . ''
next month is june .
wait a minute -- what < u > is < /u > next month ?
send that .
now we get it down to two words -- '' next month . ''
cut it out .
sure .
your wife knows that , do n't she ?
back is in new york .
just a minute -- i do n't think we need the word `` back '' -- where < u > is < /u > `` back '' ?
right . here 's eighty cents . send it .
wait a minute -- i think i can cut something else out . `` back in four weeks . '' instead of `` in four weeks '' -- say `` next month '' -- that saves another word .
that 's right . i owe you a dollar sixty .
`` will -- be -- back -- in -- four -- weeks . '' you do n't need the `` will be . '' just say `` back in four weeks . ''
how ?
wait a minute -- i think i can cut out a couple o ' more words .
that 's right -- here 's the eighty cents for you . i 'd rather see you get it than the company -- send it right off .
`` will be back in four weeks '' -- -- that saves you eighty cents right there !
then you do n't have to tell her -- cut out new york .
sure .
your wife knows that , do n't she ?
in new york .
where do you live ?
how ?
eighty cents a word -- three -- six -- nine words . that 'll be seven twenty , but it 's too much -- i 'll show you how to save some money .
what 'll i say ?
here you are , sir .
all right , folks , get on your mark . when you hear the pistol shot --
i was never stiffer in my life .
well , you got the first down -- there 's one more to go . come on , we 're ready to start right now . come on . just keep stiff .
who won ?
come on , get up . that horse is carrying too much of a load .
that 's fine .
tell her you 're on your way to france and will be back in four weeks .
she 's in new york .
hey , boy -- give this man a cablegram blank . where is your wife ?
that 's news to me . i 'd better cable my wife .
this is a fine time to be asking that . you 're on your way to france .
not yet . say , where is this boat headed for ?
well , did you find me ?
oh , was that me you put to bed ? thanks . i 've been looking all over for you .
i thought i put you to bed .
hello , denby !
< u > nuts < /u > to you too !
i can see where i wo n't talk much to you .
so what ?
yes -- me -- in person !
not the < u > real < /u > chad denby ? --
that 's me !
i can see you 're no gentleman --
knots !
what ?
no . < u > knots < /u > !
pretty good -- thirty < u > miles < /u > an hour --
oh , -- we 're doing about thirty --
i 'll say -- how fast is this boat going ?
never mind .
let me see now -- do n't tell me -- you 're dumber than me and i 'm dumber than you . i do n't get it .
not now , toots -- which is the right way to say this ? you 're dumber than me -- or -- you 're dumber than i ?
that 's right -- you 're the one i was looking for . you 'll excuse me . how about you and i being alone ?
oh , there you are --
< u > denby ! < /u > -- are you chad denby ?
he 's funny -- maybe you can use him in the show , mr. denby .
yes !
is this your gun ?
yes -- but i did n't give it to him --
he asked for a loan of it , did n't he ?
i did n't --
yeah --
maybe he just travels in bad company .
well , i 'll tell you -- we picked him up about a year ago -- but could never pin anything on him .
oh , nothing -- only i wondered why you suspected him .
well , i 've seen him here and there . what 's on your mind ?
i understand you searched brett for it last night . by the way -- what do you know about him ?
yes , a bracelet 's been lost , but i 'm still on my vacation .
hello , inspector -- i hear your vacation 's been spoiled . somebody lost a bracelet .
oh no -- i do n't want to impose on you -- it 's funny about that billfold -- i could have sworn i had it-
it 's all right -- if you like honest faces -- let 's have another drink -- steward !
he 's a likable chap -- he 's got an honest face --
it must be the sea air -- it gets everybody .
those kids seem to be getting along fine ! --
yeah -- if he 'd only stick to shuffle-board .
you can always tell how much a man 's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board .
too bad we 're not making a trip around the world -- maybe we could finish this game . hey ! when you get through with that conference , shoot that last disk !
looks to me like standard equipment for the department of street cleaning --
here we are , folks -- eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad -- they go mad as chad denby -- with the arms of iron , and the nerves of steel -- picks up his racket -- what is this thing -- a racket or a mallet ?
miss marsh .
mckinney 's the name .
of course -- but -- there 's your cue -- hurry up --
why -- do n't you like him ?
very --
very serious ?
yes .
< u > he < /u > does . here 's your quarter , brett .
i do n't get the humor of that remark .
what 's the difference ? he 's got more heads than he needs .
you 're just a master of ceremonies . he might have knocked his head off .
guess they 're dull -- nothing for you to reform .
women are such fools ! -- why do so many of us pass up < u > right < /u > guys ?
i 'll never love anybody else .
come on , now -- you 've forgotten all about that .
but not nice enough to marry -- eh ?
chad denby broadcasting -- -- the nicest man i ever knew --
stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months -- you 'll soon forget all about it .
women have a curious taste for knickknacks . when i found out about ned -- tried to make a break -- lee would n't stand for it and -- well -- here i am !
i felt pretty low , sally , when i heard you were running around with a racketeer --
i was so crazy about him -- anything he did or said was o.k . by me . i introduced him to people -- even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked . it did n't seem to matter -- i did n't care -- -- until he roped ned in . some confidence game -- and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass .
i get it -- lee lother have a hand in that , too ?
it was n't only that -- ned was in a jam .
news travels fast on broadway -- you had to get away from a rat --
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours ' notice -- you never asked why , but i guess you know .
do what --
i came to tell you what a swell guy i think you are to do this --
no -- inexperienced -- a red-headed kid -- homemade clothes -- broadway was paradise -- and a slot at the automat was a banquet .
still got my picture , i see -- i was pretty dumb then , was n't i , chad ?
no -- not much -- excepting --
you never fail at anything , do you , chad ?
why not ? i give 'em a great show -- and you know -- we 're doing capacity , sally -- and all < u > nice < /u > people --
and you 've put it over -- have n't you ?
yep -- spending lots of time aboard -- you see , sally , i sold this transatlantic idea to the shipping company .
swell -- you 've got times square right here -- all but the noises --
like it ?
looks like your old workshop back on 42nd street .
just what the doctor ordered .
everything o.k . ?
are you paying any attention to his jokes ? -- the first thing you know , you 'll be taking piano lessons from venus de milo -- get out of here .
you 're the president . come in ! your brother was just telling me a few jokes i can use on the radio --
am i a member of this club ?
will be -- as soon as the ship sails .
are you happy ?
well , that 's something -- even if only the fish can see it .
you do n't shoot squirrels .
meaning what ?
i just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks .
oh -- i understand you were an important part of her education when she came to new york .
why do n't you be a good little boy and leave her alone ?
what do you mean ?
i 'll give you another chance to tell the truth , lother .
good-night , folks .
oh , mr. denby , i wrote a poem about a bracelet --
oh , -- i was having so much fun i almost forgot --
oh , chad -- what about the rest of the show ?
oh , all right -- see you later , toots .
h'mm ... no wonder i have trouble rounding up this show -- do n't you know there 's a rehearsal going on ? -- and you wanted a raise. -- come on -- get going or you 'll get it !
no -- he 's probably one of the `` here 's how . '' take it easy -- the ocean 's pretty rough today --
is that one of the who 's who ?
do n't blame it on the ocean ! -- all right , you 'll get the raise !
never mind the who 's who -- before i get on this boat i want to know what 's what ! how about my raise ? all i get out of these ocean trips is dizzy .
all right -- do n't spoil the trip with any of those jokes -- there 's a nice bunch of people on this trip -- nothing but class -- i looked over the passenger list and they 're all members of the who 's who !
get that out of your trunk .
so what ?
-- and he has sex appeal .
so have i -- i can get it right out of my trunk .
well , he has a straw hat --
what 's he got that i have n't got ?
maurice chevalier ! there 's a fellow with personality .
oh yeah ? -- my personality put this thing over --
with your dry wit and humor --
mary -- fall off the boat and turn to the left --
when it falls off the table and turns turtle -- cute ?
all right . when < u > is < /u > a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup ?
i feel better now -- i 've got a riddle ! when is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup ?
everyone but me -- what do you want now , mary ?
oh , mr. den-n-by !
put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole --
mr. denby -- what do you think i ought to do with that part ?
h'mm -- < u > dear < /u > atlantic --
i 'm getting seasick --
what 's the matter , mary ?
but i 'm not finished yet -- -- and your waves are so colossal -- rocking boats both to and fro -- oh-h , atlantic , how i love you -- -- how i love you --
very good , mary --
oh , you dear atlantic ocean -- how you spread across the sea -- from new york to dear old europe -- just for boats to ride on thee --
well , let 's hear the poem --
somebody 's got to do it --
but , mary -- everybody 's having such a great time -- why spoil it ?
i just wrote a poem about the atlantic ocean --
yep -- everybody 's having a good time but me -- what do you want , mary ?
easy kid -- easy ... . come on -- i want to talk to you .
do n't ask any questions -- just give it to me .
what for ?
you 've got a gun , have n't you , chad ? will you let me have it ?
what happened to you ?
no -- but i 'm going to keep my eye on --
oh ! -- so that 's it . does she know he 's on board ?
chad -- lother 's on the boat , and i 'm worried sick about sally --
then , after the first number , i tell the one about the scotchman trying to open a pullman window -- the scotchman says to the window -- '' gee you 're tight . '' -- and the window says -- '' you loosen up a bit and so will i . '' -- good ? -- and then i do the one -- oh -- you do n't like it , eh ?
it 's a long trip and we 'll get that sucker later .
i went for four .
about twelve hundred .
how much did you lose ?
well , i helped my hand so i 'll have to see you .
out my way in montana we always call a bluff .
better unlock the door . sit up , darling , and be dignified .
the country boy 's about due .
the man that marks them is an artist -- two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks -- and they 're worth it .
they 're a cinch to read -- queen of clubs -- -- ace of diamonds .
can you read 'em jack ?
looks lonesome -- bring him over here .
that 's him ! that 's the sucker ! !
there 's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin ' for a fly . i 've already been workin ' on a young fellow from chicago -- related to one of the big packin ' families -- on his way to biarritz for a good time . likes a little game of bridge and poker .
he works the boats as a `` come-on '' man . we ought to make a fair combination and do a little business . jack 's a pretty good dealer himself .
eh ? ... oh .
you 're wasting your time -- she 's a friend of mine .
not a chance -- i 'm through .
i know he is . you change those clothes and then come to my cabin . i 'll expect you around twelve o'clock .
i 'm not so clumsy with fingerprints --
have you ever figured they might extradite you ?
do n't be a mug all your life -- i 'm trying to help you -- you need me more than i need you -- have you figured they might pick the kid up in france and extradite him ?
i 've lost my taste for knickknacks --
go ahead -- you did n't used to be so fussy --
let 's see if i can bring it back to life .
do n't , lee -- that 's dead .
that 's a bet -- but i could n't let you walk out like that , sally . i 'd have gone cuckoo back there -- just thinking about you --
-- and you swear when you get to the other side , you 'll never come near either of us again ?
just smile again and be reasonable . i 'll order dinner here -- just the two of us -- like old times .
i 'm crazy about the kid and i got him into it . what do you want me to do ?
you ca n't bluff me any more .
of course not -- -- but is n't it a coincidence that he 's from the eighteenth precinct -- where they made the squawk ?
not because of ned .
do n't kid yourself -- you know how i stand back there .
-- you 'd go with him !
a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and --
you leave the kid alone .
thanks to me .
he 's all right .
that 's more like the old sally -- a little bit of fire . how about ned ?
you get wise to < u > yourself < /u > ! if you know what 's good for you , you 'll leave me alone . everybody 's entitled to one mistake -- well -- you 're mine . when the going got too rough , i pulled up stakes and quit . we stay quit ! -- get that ! -- and what 're you going to do about it ?
get wise to yourself , sally -- you 're no sob story .
i wish i could .
because i want you -- will always want you -- no other woman 'll ever take your place . i want you more now than i did that first night -- you 've forgotten all that , i suppose ?
why do n't you leave me alone ?
it was n't smart . even if you 'd gotten away without me -- i 'd have found you -- no matter where you were .
i did n't want to see you again -- that 's my privilege .
you ran away because you were afraid . i do n't want it to end like that .
all right -- but what is there to face ? it 's finished .
this is interesting -- why did n't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night ?
i tried to borrow a gun from chad , but --
because i was yellow , i guess --
why ?
i would n't say that -- i 'm glad he 's dead -- yes -- i 'd thought of killing him -- but i did n't --
s'pose you 've never thought of killing him --
no !
you did n't have a gun in your hand last night ?
yes , yes !
he 's a swell person . he told me he 'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million .
next time i get a vacation i 'll spend it at headquarters . good-night .
i hope so . well , i guess you two can do without me . i 'll be seeing you .
i 've got a hunch you 're going to win that bet , inspector .
soon as i get that bracelet back i 'm going to relax . wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out -- i got to win that fifty bucks .
for a very excellent reason from your own admission -- -- i 'm not saying you < u > did < /u > -- but i think you know more than you 're telling . years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence . nevertheless , in your case there 's plenty of it .
why should < u > i < /u > kill him ?
i sincerely hope so --
that 's the truth -- every single word !
maybe you will after you 've thought it over .
sure i would -- but i do n't get what you 're driving at .
and if you liked the person , you 'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight , would n't you ?
well , of course , i would n't take it .
i mean if you knew it were stolen .
say , `` thanks very much ! ''
he 'll be back . what would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet ?
exciting , was n't it ? where 's jimmy ?
congratulations .
good night !
it 's getting kind of chilly on deck . if you 'll excuse me , i think i 'll go to bed . good night , mr. mckinney !
nothin -- -- i just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks .
what 's the matter ?
well , i 'll be a son of a sea cook !
it all depends on what you 're used to .
i mean -- a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that .
`` smooth 's '' the word .
he 's certainly good-natured .
thirty one 's and two ten 's ?
thank you .
there you are , sir .
if he comes near you again , i 'll break his neck --
i 'll explain later --
what ! -- are you crazy ?
i was in his cabin --
you saw him sitting out there in front , did n't you ?
i 'm all right .
are n't the roses beautiful ?
sure , sis .
is n't it great to be away from it all ? are n't you happy ? it seems too good to be true .
do you think lother could have seen it ?
i thought i had our sailing covered up -- -- and here it is .
because you ran after me .
then why did you run away ?
yer crazy ! -- i ai n't got no bracelet .
i saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe .
i tell yuh i ai n't got no bracelet --
hey -- you ! where you going ?
ai n't got time .
let me look at it .
nothin ' .
well -- get a move on yer -- then get back to yer station .
telegrams .
everything in order , sir ? what are < u > you < /u > doing here , my lad ?
does it hurt ? a lot ? good .
oh , my god ...
why ed , what an ugly thing to say ! does this mean you 're not my friend anymore ? you know , ed , if i thought you were n't my friend i do n't think i could bear it .
skinny lunger , your guns do n't impress me . was n't for those guns you 'd be nothin ' .
now ed , are we cross ?
just pick up your money and go . sick of listening to you simper .
is n't that a daisy ?
god damn son of a ...
ed bailey , you look like you 're just ready to burst . well call me a fool but i guess i 'll just have to call . cover your ears , darling .
oh , for christ 's sake !
500 ? sly boots , must be a peach of a hand .
i said that 's 500 to you , holliday . in or out ?
that 's not what i meant .
nice voice .
what d'you think of the singer ?
actually , you know , that 's not a bad idea , send a signal we 're growing up .
fine , fine . but i was thinkin ' , you know what this town really needs is a race track .
so how 's tombstone treating you ?
well i 'm the man to see . besides sheriff i 'm also tax collector , captain of the fire brigade , and chairman of the non-partisan anti- chinese league . a man of many parts . got a place to stay yet ? i also sit on the townlot commission . got a couple of lovely cottages coming up for rent . here , let me show you ...

you whore ! you filthy whore !
my man ? you told wyatt you 'd disarmed those men . do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man ? you 're just a dirty little fixer .
i saw that look pass between you and wyatt at the fight . listen to me ! you 're mine ! understand ? you 're my woman and i 'm your man .
not now . i do n't have time .
listen , i want to talk to you .
absolutely nothing .
i saw that look on your face just now . what 's between you and wyatt ?
maybe even my destiny .
well i guess you can see , never a dull moment . maybe you should stay around to see what happens next . who know ? you might find a future here .
oh , so that 's it ...
yes , very . and very married .
a peace officer ... impressive man
that 's wyatt earp . made quite a name for himself as a peace officer in kansas .
the man dealing faro . who is he ?
look kid , i know what it 's like , i was a kid , too . even stole a horse once . but you ca n't --
come and get him .
look , i do n't want any trouble with you but that 's my horse and i mean to have him back . one way or another .
where do you think ? i stole him .
i asked where you got him .

they were all gon na jump me back there . what ever happened to one against one ?
fair enough . you know i got to admit , you got a lot of bark on you comin ' up here like this .
make you a deal . my brother took over the marshal 's office in tombstone . got it in his head he 's gon na make the place safe for widows and orphans . you and your boys stay out of his way , i 'll make sure he stays out of yours .
feel bad about ol ' fred . just ca n't hold back when i 'm feelin ' woolly . still , feel kinda bad . but now we 're square . anyway no use for holdin ' a grudge . i deserved a rap in the head .
crack me back of the head like some stinkin ' bull . hell , you ai n't no fightin ' man , you 're just a cop .
come on , you ...
good . that 's real good .
i 'm retired .
already got a guilty conscience , might as well have the money too .
i see , off to strike it rich , huh . all right , fine , wish you luck . tell you this though , never was a rich man yet did n't wind up with a guilty conscience .
no marshal , you do n't understand . i 'm through with lawing , i 'm through with the whole proposition . forever . i did my duty , now i 'd like to get on with my life . that is if you do n't mind . jesus . good day now .
but wait , you do n't understand-
i said forget it , answer 's no , i do n't want the job and that 's final . i 'm going to tombstone and nothin ' short of dyin 's gonn stop me . good day .
excuse me ?
forget it .
say when .
all right , lunger . let 's do it .
i was kidding about that .
i beg to differ . we started a fight we never got to finish . play for blood , remember ?
my fight 's not with you , holliday .
why johnny ringo , you look like somebody just walked over your grave . oh , i was n't quite as sick as i made out .
here it come : one-two-
on three ? you call it .
all right , lunger . have at it .
that 's just my game .
in pace requiescat .
ecentus stultorum magister .
credat judaeus apella .
age quod agis .
and you must be ringo . look , darling , johnny ringo . the deadliest pistoleer since wild bill , they say . what do you think , darling ? should i hate him ?
yeah , you look it .
not me . i 'm in my prime .
you retired , too ?
that 's the rumor .
yes , i know . you are a good woman .
i 'm a good woman to you , doc . do n't i always take care of you ? nobody cares for you like me . i 'm a good woman .
not exactly ...
what 's that mean , doc ? you know i do n't understand when you talk up high like that . you mean you do n't want to be my lovin ' man no more ?
we must talk , darling . it appears we have to ... redefine the nature of our association .
that 's good . i knew it was n't nothin ' .
better .
how you feeling , doc ?
nothing . not a thing . i 'm right as the mail .
what 's wrong , doc ?
enough ? never .
that 's my lovin ' man . just ca n't get enough .
yes , but there 's just something about him . something around the eyes , i do n't know , reminds me of ... me . no . i 'm sure of it , i hate him .
you do n't even know him .
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
i calculate that 's the end of this town . and let 's do n't bother about the luggage , darling .
bless you , darling darling ! are you mad ? you 're not wearing a bustle . how lewd !
here , doc .
run . take that girl and start running . run and do n't look back . all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by . this time run and do n't look back and call it living . live every second , live it right up to the hilt . live , wyatt ... live for me .
all right . then what ?
first you can grab that black- haired woman and make her your own .
then what do i do ?
i played the cards i was dealt , wyatt . your problem is you 're always trying to play someone else 's . allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free : there is no happiness , wyatt there is no normal life . there 's only life , that 's all . just life . the rest is relative .
that 's great coming from you .
when will you wake up ? you would n't know a normal life if it bit you in the ass .
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life .
you think i 'm kidding . you 're the most fallible , wrong-headed , self- deluding , just generally benighted jackass i 've ever known . yet , withal , even at your worst , you 're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope .
all right , doc ...
i imagine it would , yes . so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties .
hurts . hurts pretty bad .
rather an obvious question under the circumstances , do n't you agree ? a better one might be how do you feel ?
how you feelin ' , doc ?
well hell , wyatt . wyatt , i want you to meet father feeney . father feeney 's just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome . you see , it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds .
never got to wear one of those .
that 's all right , doc . do n't worry .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , wyatt . god , i 'm so sorry .
revenge ? for what ?
what does he want ? he wants revenge .
so what does he want ?
a man like ringo 's got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he ca n't ever fill it . he ca n't kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it . and it drives him mad . sick mad . cold and dirty .
what makes a man like ringo , doc ? what makes him do the things he does ?
do n't touch me , god damn it ! just do n't touch me ! come on ...
doc ...
i do n't know . it all happened so fast . if i 'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would 've been scared but ... swear to god , doc , i just do n't know .
i 'm a man without fear , wyatt . i literally do n't care if i live or die . but even i ca n't fight human instinct . somebody suddenly starts shooting at me , i duck . but you ... what on earth were you thinking about ?
no ...
wyatt , my god ! you 're shot to pieces !
felt his liver go on that last one . get him to a doctor or he 'll be dead in a couple hours .
it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut .
sorry , sorry ...
i wo n't be pawed at , thank you very much
but doc-
nonsense , i have not yet begun to defile myself .
been hittin ' it awful hard , doc .
wyatt ! just in time . pull up a chair .
you will or you wo n't . do n't look to me . i 'm going to sleep .
maybe i ought to go out there .
in vino veritas .
he 's drunk .
i stand corrected . wyatt . you 're an oak .
satisfied ?
i 'll remember you said that .
i 'd ignore her . people can change , doc .
ignore her ?
i do n't know . probably ignore her .
you know damn well who i mean . that dusky-hued lady satan .
i see . and what would you do if `` she '' walked in her right now ? wyatt `` she '' ?
well yeah . pretty much . i mean i was no angel when we met but people change doc . i mean sooner or later you got ta grow up .
so tell me , wyatt . i 'm curious . do you actually consider youself a married man ? forsaking all others ?
and what a maiden , pure as the driven snow , i 'm sure .
so now we 're in the mining business . turning into regular tycoons . gon na call this one the mattie blaylock . mattie 'll get a kick out of that , it 's her maiden name .
but who was the devil ?
very instructive
i know him . that 's creek johnson .
very cosmopolitan .
forgive me if i do n't shake hands .
sheriff behan , doc holliday .
that 's what i love about wyatt . he can talk himself into anything .
depends how you look at it . i mean it 's not like anybody 's holding a gun to their heads .
i said poker 's an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .
did n't you always say gambling 's an honest trade ?
since when is faro a business ?
perfect , wyatt . simply perfect .
doc ! how the hell are you ?
you know , frederic-fucking-chopin .
a which ?
i see , well this happens to be a nocturne .
you know , stephen foster . `` oh , susanna '' . `` camptown races '' , stephen-stinkin'-foster !
what ?
hey , is that `` old dog tray '' ? sounds like `` old dog tray '' .
i 'm telling you , there is n't a mark on him .
what ? but i saw 'em-
i do n't believe it . he 's clean !
i do n't .
hell , i got lot 's of friends .
wyatt earp is my friend .
then why in hell 're you doin ' this ? you ought to be in bed .
not half as bad as i feel .
you really look awful .
sorry ...
do n't touch me !
sheriff , may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates , turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion ? watch your ear , creek .
drunks . crawfished a bet , called him a liar . i saw the whole thing .
damn ! all right , wait a minute ...
you 're the doctor . sad news , friend .
ca n't take the heat , get outta the kitchen .
awful lot of money .
told you . i 'm red hot , i 'm blazin ' ! now , red seven . seven stinkin ' diamonds . look out ! five thousand ! let 's go !
i 'm your man ... you win again . well played , sir . you are on fire .
all right , i 'm on fire ! black seven , seven stickin ' spades . let 's go !
so 're the cowboys . they 're up that road right now , waiting to jump us .
colorado 's closer
all right , what 's it to be ? new mexico 's that way .
i know . me neither .
wyatt , i ... i ai n't got the words .
all right wyatt , maybe you can . but you got ta die to do it . understand ? you got ta die !
but i 'd do it , i 'd get that one into him . so help me god , i would .
i made a promise .
wyatt , are you crazy ?
you tell ringo ... just tell him i 'll be there .
cards in spades . i 'm in love with every second of her life . hell , i 'll probably love her when i 'm dust .
good god , you 're really-
see how she breezed out of here . like she had wings . funny thing but i ca n't really remember how she looked . i can remember parts of her clear as crystal , her mouth , her walk , how she shut her eyes when she laughed , little bits and pieces , but not the whole package . ca n't put it together for some reason .
no .
what ?
no .
there 's no reasoning with him .
maybe you ought to have a talk with doc , wyatt . i do n't know if he 's gon na make it .
i 'll pay you 500 each in advance and i 'll mount you on those .
are you out of your mind ? what on earth 'd make us-
what was that all about ?
hello , wyatt ! hiya doc !
it rides right at 'em . like mcmasters said , see it through to the end .
we 're the law , ai n't we ? well the law do n't ride around vermin-
i 'll be dipped in shit . i will , too .
praise jesus !
he 's right , wyatt . ringo could put five into you before you could even get one into him .
wyatt , listen , you ca n't beat him . you 're good and god knows you got the courage , but you ai n't in ringo 's class . hell , he 's the best that 's ever been . 'cept maybe for wild bill .
never even heard of anything like it .
hey creek , you ever see anything like that before ?
how is he ?
yeah , better run , you bastards !
not so sure . somethin ' tells me it gets harder from here in . should 've held out for more money .
you know , we might just pull this off .
yeah . or undertakers .
there they go . look kinda like preachers .
do n't worry , wyatt . my family 's rich .
i have nothing left . i have nothing to give you . i have no pride , no dignity , no money . i do n't even know how we 'll make a living . but i promise i 'll love you every second of your life .
did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies ? it hits all of a sudden and below there 's california and you swear you 're looking at heaven .
wyatt ! my god ...
wait !
i have to go .
you did . well ... thank you .
i forgave you the moment you said it .
sorry about your friend . and i 'm sorry about ...
wyatt ...
no , no , get away , get away from me ...
i ca n't , i 'm sorry . forgive me .
you know you do n't have to sneak . you could stay with me . i know things , wyatt . sweet things . i could make you so happy .
i did n't mean it that way .
you feel bad about this ? about me ?
look , it 's too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i ca n't go back and i ca n't sneak , feel back enough as it is .
so i assume we 're regarding this as just a kind of interlude .
getting late . we better get back .
always ?
well you 'll always be sadie to me .
i hate sadie .
josie ... no , i 'm gon na call you sadie .
and i 'm josephine sarah marcus . my friends call me josie .
easy to fix . wyatt berry stapp earp .
and i do n't even know your full name .
fortuitous even .
i must say this certainly has been an unexpected little windfall .
then let 's make sure we get our money 's worth
you know this is adultery . you burn in hell for that .
i know , me too . what should we do about it ?
i do n't know , does n't make any sense . i almost ca n't look at you . like it hurts .
what 's wrong ?
well you 're different , no arguing that . but you 're a lady all right . i 'll take my oath on it .
oh look , i have n't got time to be proper , i want to live . i 'm a woman , i like men . if that 's unladylike then i guess i 'm not a lady . at least i 'm honest .
the way you talk . never heard a woman talk like that .
well he 's handsome and he 's charming . he 's all right . for now . do n't say it , i know , i 'm rotten . i ca n't help it . i 've tried to be good but it 's too boring .
you mean behan ? then why are you with him ?
see ? you 're laughing again . but that 's what i want . go places and move and never look back and just have fun . forever . that 's my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .
room service .
well i ought to know my own mind and i 'm tellin ' you what suits me is a family and kids . that suits me right down to the ground . in fact , that 's my idea of heaven . all right , what 's your idea of heaven ?
just does n't , that 's all .
how would you know ?
does n't suit you .
i do n't know , make some money , have some kids , you know .
just answer .
where do you get these questions ?
nothing ... tell me , what do you want out of life ?
what about her ?
of course , i 'm always happy . unless i 'm bored . that blonde woman , is that your wife ?
i 'm not touchy , i just , it 's a silly question , that 's all . am i happy ? are you happy ?
you 're a little touchy about it .
am i happy ? i do n't know . happy as the next man , i guess . i do n't laugh all day long like an idiot , if that 's what you mean .
yes , but how often ? tell me , are you happy ?
i laugh sometimes
would n't you ? you 're laughing ! i was sure you never laughed .
you 'd die for fun ?
fun though , was n't it ?
you know you almost got us both killed back there ?
that was lovely !
i have a better idea , let 's run it out of them !
they know . it 's the scent . we better split 'em up .
oh ... now she 's starting . how do they know ?
easy now ... that mare 's in season .
what is it ?
i know what it means .
wyatt earp , i know . i was beginning to think we 'd never meet . this is fortuitous . that means lucky .
we 've never actually met . my name's-
do n't worry , doc , it 's not your problem . you do n't have to mix up in this .
those cowboys 're tellin ' everybody in town they 're gon na clean you out . they 're down in that lot right now behind the ok corral .
well sure , neighbor , easy to say .
why do n't you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer ?
you see that bird at the faro table ? that 's johnny tyler . he barged in here one day , said he was takin ' over the game , started slappin ' customer , wavin ' his gun around , scarin ' off all the high-class play . only trade comes in here now 's just bummers and drovers , just the dregs .
well , excuse me for askin ' , milt , but is n't it kinda dead in here ?
milt joyce , owner-operator .
let me have one of those cigars . kinda nice in here . you run it ?
what can i get you ?
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she 's nothing to you ? right out loud so i can hear ? tell her she 's nothing , tell her she 's nobody , just dirt ? will you do that ?
all right , look . i can make it right , i can make this up to you , mattie . i can , i swear .
you know nothing . what you do n't know would fill a book . jesus , i feel like it 's when you 're around i need it most . you 're never yourself , you never relax . never . everything 's so stiff and dead . you always have to keep a rein on everything , ever yourself . oh , you smile sometimes , i 've even seen you laugh . but there 's no light in your smile for me , wyatt , nothing to keep me warm . and i get cold , wyatt . i get so cold . what 's between you and that jew woman ?
look , mattie , i know you're-
admit what , i 'm an opium fiend ? no , wyatt , i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night .
'least you admit it .
i need it .
mattie . what about this ?
yeah , well , i swore a lot of things .
thought you swore you 'd never carry that thing again .
just thinkin ' out loud . forget it .
wyatt , what 're you talkin ' about ?
well , i was thinking , we 've already made a pile of money . maybe we should just pull up stakes and move on . and we could stay on the move , you know ? just keep going , see the world . live on room service the rest of our lives . how 'd that be ?
sure i 'm sure . what is this ?
really ? you sure ?
i do n't know . i 'm all right .
out ridin ' . so ... how you doin ' ?
i know what i 'm doing . where have you been ?
that the bottle lou gave you ? better go easy on that stuff .
all right , well , good night .
just go . it 's all right . wyatt , really . work well .
no really , i can stay a while .
no , no , i do n't want to keep you .
well i guess i do n't have to go right now . i guess i could stay a little while .
oh , all right .
honey , i got ta start makin ' money .
no , stay . please stay with me .
you get lonely ?
they 're just lonely is all . hell , i howl myself sometimes .
long as i live i 'll never get used to that sound .
i think i 'll just lie down awhile
come up to the fire , honey .
mattie , they 're here ! folks this is celia ann but you can call her mattie . or even mrs. earp if you prefer .
wyatt , i could n't find a single store that had laudanum any-
you 're the boss . one thing , though .
'least they do n't scare women .
is n't there anything i can say that 'll change your mind ? you 're gon na stay with your new friends ?
forget it , ringo .
you 're a cowboy , you 're a brother . come back , no hard feelings .
that what you got me up here for ?
yeah , kinda , wanted to see if you 'd join back up with us .
you wanted to talk ?
well hello , sherm .
might as well hear him out . anyways , what choice we got ? but no matter what happens , see it through to the end . if you do n't i 'll curse the day i ever laid eyes on you .
i do n't like it .
we 'll go around that way , come up on foot .
there they are . no herd though .
they 're wise by now . which is next , iron springs ? yeah , let 's try there , iron springs .
next waterhole 's black draw . we could be there by mid-morning .
so he can tell the story .
what 'd you do that for ?
we 'll see about that .
but this time they 'll be ready .
i know that cut . you mean there 's a waterhole near there ?
drop his horse .
florentino ! he 's getting away !
all right , run 'em off .
i ai n't your brother , i ai n't none of your damn brothers . move !
not anymore , not after this .
no ? brothers to the bone , right ?
no , wait . please . i know nothin ' i say 'll fix things but i want you to know it was n't me .
there 's all kinds of horses , ai n't there ? same with cowboys . what they do 's their affair . i do n't preach and i do n't judge . i ai n't no dog-catcher .
yeah , but some of the things they say your brothers 've done ...
if i had to explain it you would n't understand . just say we 're brothers to the bone .
so what about you cowboys anyway ?
well in that case , i saw your horse . billy clanton was takin ' him up to the cut to show him off . the boys 're all up there right now , branding . and in a mood . still want your property back , mr. private citizen ?
i 'm not a lawman , i 'm just a private citizen getting ' my property back
look , i got a rule . i do n't talk to lawmen . dog-catchers neither .
mcmasters , is n't it ? listen , you seen a black stallion with-
run for your lives , boys ! it 's that great two-gun dog-catcher from kansas !
is n't true . i ca n't see a damn thing .
easy morg , do n't think about that now .
remember about the light you 're supposed to see when you 're dyin ' ?
will somebody get the damn dog out-
you were right , wyatt . they got me good . do n't let 'em get you too .
you 're on .
i just got it fixed .
listen to yourself , wyatt . lie down and crawl or you might get hurt ? what kinda talk is that ? that 's virgil lyin ' over there , wyatt . our own brother . ruined for life . no sir , i ai n't going no place . you want to go , fine . i 'm stayin ' right here and have it out with those bastards .
i know , i was wrong . but morg , look , we got to get out .
i am usin ' it , wyatt . been wonderin ' how the hell we got in this tangle . you know they hit clum 's house , too ? shot up his wife . his wife . who ever heard of that ? men sneakin ' around in the dark , back-shootin ' , scarin ' women ? they 're bugs , wyatt . you know all your smart talk about live and let live ? ai n't no live and let live with bugs .
morg , use your head .
what 's it look like ? they want a piece of me they can come and get it , i 'm not crawlin ' into my hole .
morgan , are you crazy ? they 're out gunning for us ! what the hell 're you doin ' ?

that did n't sound like thunder .
that thunder 's sure somethin ' .
i 'm the one made a mess . made a right fair mess of the whole thing .
dropped him , that was it . sorry if i made a worse mess for you .
i know , kid . i know . me too .
you were right . it 's nothin ' like i thought . i almost wish ...
fine . better .

i know . and nobody can make him .
doc wo n't quit , been up 36 hours . clanton came in an hour ago , they switched over to poker . tried to get him to bed but he just wo n't let go .
what 're you talkin ' about ?
all right , say you 're right , say you do n't get yourself killed . there 's something else . it 's too late for virge , he already rolled his bone . but it 's not too late for you , morg .
like you said , just got ta know how to handle 'em . old fred was n't up to it . we know that we 're doin ' , wyatt .
yeah ?
come on , we 're not about pickin ' fights . just gon na keep a little order , that 's all .
listen to me , both of you . this is no good . this is trouble we do n't need . for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family . do this and you throw it all away . you saw what happened to fred white .
just his style , morg . does n't mean anything .
hey doc ! come on now .
i 'll be damned ...
it 's that woman from the coach !
lotta law around here . just met the sheriff .
wyatt , meet fred white , he 's town marshal .
hey , wyatt , god damn it , i 'm serious !

well what do you think happens when you die ?
maybe , yeah . hell , i do n't know .
boy , look at all those stars . bet you can see every star there is . practical touch 'em . kinda makes you think , you know ? i mean you look up and you think god made all that but he still remembered to make a little speck like me . kinda flattering really . hey , wyatt , you believe in god ? no , come on , really , do you ?
hope so . clean up with this boy .
give him some good exercise ? sure some stud . some string in fact . what 're you gon na do , race 'em ?

well how do we look ?
listen mister , i 'm getting ' tired-
go ahead . skin it . skin that smoke wagon and see what happens .
well i 'm real scared .
yeah . it 's a fact .
that a fact ?
do n't need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you .
for a man that do n't go heeled you run your mouth kinda reckless .
yeah . it 's a fact .
that a fact ?
just wanted to let you know you 're sitting in my chair .
you back that queen again , you son of a bitch , i 'll blow you right out of that chair ! somethin ' on your mind ?
doc 's just in no kinda shape .
we should get moving .
sure ...
talked it over . we decided we do n't need the money . took out 13 dollars each , though . federal posseman 's fee . that all right ?
500 ... year 's wages . and i never even saw a horse like that .
got a sheaf of federal warrants . being in the territories it 's up to our discretion how they 're served . that means we got the cowboys without quarter . the black flag , brother . no prisoners , no mercy , amen .
they 're nothing . they 're nobody . i want the cowboys . all of 'em . i mean to break 'em up , drive 'em out of the territory .
way ahead of you , wyatt . you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan . everybody knows they 're the ones to blame for your brothers .
jack ...
easy , gents . private affair ... wyatt ! doc ! hey !
wyatt ...
virgil ?
bundle up , virge . cold out there .
getting late . guess i 'll turn in .
look at 'em all . they love it . how in the hell 'd we get ourselves into this ?
wyatt , i know what i 'm doin ' .
virge , you 're makin ' the arrest . you make contact , i 'll back you up . morgan 'll back me up , doc 'll keep an eye out for trouble . and keep your hands on your guns . they even look like they 're gon na start something , buffalo 'em . right over the head .
all right , virge , your call . but give doc the shotgun . they 'll be less apt to get nervy if they see him on the street howitzer .
no , damn it , it 's wrong , they 're breakin ' the law .
virge , that 's a misdemeanor . you go down there to arrest 'em , something goes wrong , maybe this time somebody gets his head broke , suddenly it 's a mess and it wo n't end there , you 'll have cowboys comin ' around lookin ' for trouble from here to christmas . you gon na risk all that over a misdemeanor ?
they 're carrying guns in town .
you 'll never make that stick .
wyatt , they 're threatening our lives .
wait till the liquor wears off . once they start getting headaches they 'll lose interest .
easy , virge , they 're just tryin ' to egg us on .
here they are again . look at 'em .
just stay calm , use your head . it 'll be all right . just the same , though ... guess you better swear me in .
billy clanton , wes fuller , and billy claiborne . now there 's six of 'em . this is like a bad dream .
you are the one , wyatt . you sure are .
business is business . do n't have to love 'em to work with 'em . not if there 's money in it .
wait a minute , you thinkin ' of getting in bed with the cowboys ?
maybe i jumped the gun . maybe those cowboys are n't near as bad as they 're painted . you know i was thinkin ' , there 's a lot of money in the cattle business ...
nothing to do with me ? i 'm your brother for christ 's sake . god , i do n't believe this . talk to him , will you ? or hit him . oh no , do n't tell me ...
it 's got nothin ' to do with you , wyatt . it's-
virgil , please . do n't do this to me .
i could n't help it , wyatt . i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face . i mean these people 're afraid to even walk down the street and i 'm trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture . that 's not me , that 's somebody i do n't even know .
kinda , actually , yeah . i got ta admit .
pretty fun too , is n't it ?
i ca n't hardly believe it . it 's working out just like you said , wyatt . we 're lootin ' this burg six ways through sunday .
you know , i was thinkin ' , maybe we ought to open our own place . that 's the real money . build it up , milk it for all it 's worth , then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings . let 's you and me take a walk around town , virge , see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots .
i know , i need a keeper .
keep your eye on that brass ring . do n't let anything side-track you .
better go with 'em , honey . here 's where i leave you .
her maiden name was sullivan .
so to speak .
acquired ?
well we 're off and running . just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental .
just like any other hard cases . got ta know how to handle 'em .
look pretty rough .
hit a streak when we left . him and kate .
well that 's your problem . hey virge , see anything of doc while you were in prescott ?
we 're gon na do it , boys . gon na get ours . feel it in my bones . all we have to do is keep our eyes on that brass ring .
well here we are a family again . been so long plain forgot how good it feels . want to thank you for that , wyatt . all your doin ' .
look at that . busted . brand new money ward , too . 33 years old and i do n't even have a decent watch . 'bout time i started lookin ' out for myself .
but she doted on the frowner
allie-girl ... and louisa ! you 're so lovely . i 'm at your feet , darlin ' . just at your feet . guess it 's only right . ma always said you were the prettiest .
none of my business , fred .
no , i got ta do something . i do n't suppose you 'd card-
why do n't you just leave it alone ?
yeah , and dangerous .
ike clanton , old man 's eldest son . know he ai n't got the stuff , makes him miserable .
curly bill , huh ? who was that other idiot ?
see what i mean about it getting spooky ?
ah , now that 's the real mother- lode in tombstone . up and down allen street , full-blast 24 hours a day , liquor , hostesses , gamblin ' , makin ' money hand over fist . all except the oriental . on account of the element . have a man for breakfast in there most days . regular slaughter house . high-rollers wo n't go near it . too bad , nice place .
what about all these saloons ?
get bond out of there .
it 's too late -
bring up the tracking satellite . and get 007 out of there .
i appreciate your assistance , m. but this is now a military operation .
- thank you , m. but this is more than your man can handle . are we in agreement ?
but -
what do they say in russia , general bukharin ?
- i 'll be sure to acknowledge 007 's 'assistance ' in my report to the prime minister . but this is , still , a naval operation .
... what were you saying , admiral ? something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing , skirt-chasing playboy spy ? '
i expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours . until then , i 'm imposing my own electronic silence : for the sake of the economy , not a word to nato , the press , the cia . ... and so long as commander bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters , i want him to go along as an observer . are we agreed ?
36 hours . they 've already sailed from the persian gulf .
at least we know where the gold is . when are the recovery ships due ?
and i have the entire british economy to worry about .
i resent your tone , sir . i have men who are missing -
why was n't the ship protected ? ! ? ! why was it sailing without radar ?
admiral , are you suggesting -
excuse me , but - i must formally protest this meeting . given the nature of what 's occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force , the army , or mi-6 . this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty 's royal navy .
good evening . i 've just spoken with the prime minister at the economic summit in tokyo ; he 's expecting a full update within the hour . for those of you still unaware , some forty minutes ago -
take the girl . leave the handcuffs . we 'll drown her at sea .
i 'd rather die alone .
what about the gold ?
... as the advertising says : tomorrow never lies .
chernobyl will look like a campfire .
- instant melt-down .
precisely , mr. bond . in a matter of minutes , the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor ... and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
... so that 's what the weapons grade uranium was for .
my guards are from south africa , mr. bond . this is their chance to get even with the formerly 'great ' britain . now both of you . put your hands on your heads , and step forward .
are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl ?
good-bye , mister bond .
i 'm sure they will .
sidney , perhaps we should leave this to -
... and what 's that , my dear ?
do n't pout , sidney . i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story . he 's from 'lloyd 's of london . ' ... are n't you , mr. bond ?
briefly .
your choice . look at the time ! come . there 's someone i want you meet - about a story i 'm thinking of publishing .
... words to live by ?
you see , mr. bond , you and i are both men of action . but your era is passing . words are the new weapons ; satellites the new artillery . and make no mistake about it : in the right hands , they can be as deadly as your walther ppk .
fantastic idea mr. bond ! perhaps i should buy it for a book ! it 's totally preposterous , but - you amuse me . ... and now perhaps i can amuse you .
or disinformation ... if you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? maybe one degree a minute ?
they 're merely tools to disseminate information .
... although it must be fun to have all those satellites .
and still not a thing to watch .
welcome to the new world order , mr. bond . churchill had his armies ; caesar had his legions ; i have my divisions : news , sports , business , entertainment . and these are my foot soldiers : 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers , 4 cable news networks , 87 magazines , and 29 different cable tv channels - in 35 languages .
because it 's a dying city . since the chinese take-over , who knows what can happen tomorrow ? in any case , this is my father , charles : a royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations . said i 'd never amount to anything , but ... i turned it into this
so why did you leave ?
my third great uncle - the earl of aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese . his son-in-law - george harmsway - made the first family fortune , running opium into shanghai ... his son , thomas , who lost it , smoking the opium ... and my grandfather henry , who opened the first telegraph station , and published the colony 's first english newspaper . it was a city of unlimited possibility .
yes . i can see : you 've hung the rest of your relatives .
i call this the rogue 's gallery .
sightseeing .
by the way - what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur , mister bond ?
i can feel your pain .
still , i do miss her . i only wish she could have lived to see all this .
the only difference between a psychopath and a genius , mr. bond , is the degree of success .
i wonder if it runs in the family .
i tried to save her . but she remained a manic depressive : fits , inappropriate behavior ... delusions of grandeur .
i see .
before i became involved with paris , she was always involved with the most inappropriate ' men ... playboys . thrill seekers . middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her .
come . let 's get out of the noise . - i 'll give you a tour of the building , then we 'll talk .
sir elliot .
mr. bond ! nice to see you .
i 'm on my way .
oh , please , mr. bond . we live in the information age ! information is currency - and with the right currency , you can have any piece of information . besides i own the phone company . what do you say ? twenty minutes ?
how did you get this number ?
we 'll see about that .
a piece of advice , mr. bond : do n't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it 's deadlier than uranium .
which part ? the colonel 's ? or yours ?
i hope you 've enjoyed this little charade .
i can tell you 're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions , mr. bond . darling ! come here . i want you to meet my wife .
it 's a beautiful boat , sir elliot . practically glows in the dark .
you might say i 've always been one of mr. valentin 's biggest followers .
always nice to meet one of her majesty 's fellow subjects ... especially one with such distinguished friends .
him ? he , is a she - at the bar .
where can i find him ?
maybe you should talk to sidney winch . owns a marine salvage company . nobody knows more about the strait .
i appreciate your time -
next morning . both boats . nothing wrong . my 90 year old grandfather thinks 'ghost in the computer - silicon dragon . '
did you test the auto-pilots ? the satellite positioning receiver ?
the kuala lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night . captain blamed the auto-pilot ; i suspected he was drunk - until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem .
i 'm sorry .
sometimes kill the crew ; other times - torture them .
i know . pirates from sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships .
in the strait of malacca , when a boat is even five minutes late , one begins to worry , mr. bond .
no , 007. it 's just that i 've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - somehow the reality is never as ... satisfying as the fantasy .
what - no lust for adventure ?
not all of us , 007 .
- we all want what we ca n't have ?
actually , i 've never known you to do either ... but -
moneypenny ! how indiscreet ! have you ever known me to kiss and tell ?
by the way , james : ordinarily i would never ask , but ... were n't you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea ?
in the darkest moments , it 's what i live for . especially since i 've heard how much you like to watch ... on the hidden camera .
hello , james . enjoy your meeting ?
moneypenny ! we 've got to stop meeting like this . they may be on to us .
ah , james . you always were a cunning linguist ... au revoir , mon cher .
tsi tien , chien-penny .
four o'clock . do n't be late .
4:30. it may take me a little longer to wrap things up here .
four o'clock . m will meet you in the conference room .
moneypenny ... here i was , finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
i 'm sure she is , james . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to 'kiss off ' the rest of your lessons this afternoon .
do n't even think about it . 007. they 're my granddaughters .
i must say , q , you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement .
standard equipment . the world 's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders .
... 17 beverage cup holders ?
yes . and do try to keep all four of them on the road . all the usual refinements : smoke , missiles , machine guns - fully operational remote control . drives forward , reverse - stop that ! plus infrared thermal imaging radar , heads up instrumentation , and 17 beverage cup holders .
- four wheel drive ?
your new car .
i do n't care who you dial , so long as it 's not me . next -
do i have to dial '9 ' to get out ?
not a clue . i did n't lose the ship . next , your new personal communicator . picture-phone , fax , beeper .
do you have any idea of what any of that means ? in english ?
that hardly makes up for the imposition . now , for what i hope will be the very last time - pay attention , 007. first , computer generated retrograde analysis map . body here , meteorolog- ical influences here , likely vector- ing of the ship 's coordinates here .
i 'm sorry . it was a national emergency -
retired . i 'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore .
q ! how are you ?
i know what i saw -
that 's absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
yes , the ship is down there . but the gold is gone .
what are you talking about ? we went through all this and the ship is n't even down there ?
... that 's all well and good , captain , save for one thing : there 's no gold down there .
yes . the famous james bond . i 've heard all about you , sir . you were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off , on your own , like some half-assed cia cowboy - endangering the gold , attracting that lunatic woman , and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide .
do n't you think you 're overreacting ?
get them out of here . if he says one word , shoot him .
wait a minute -
guard ! arrest these men ! escort them to the cutter !
yes -
one thing at a time . i 'll see you in twenty minutes . go .
just - say it . say it just once .
he did n't want anyone to know . he kept it out of the papers . he said a third wife was bad for his image . you 've got to protect me !
why did n't you tell me ? why was n't it in our files ?
leave me alone ! he 's going to kill me ! !
paris -
just hold me .
shhhhh ...
i 'm so sorry , james . i promise , i 'll never leave you again .
it 's on the boat . he 's holding a press conference tomorrow .
what about the uranium ?
do you ?
do you feel better now ?
no ! he 's crazy - he 's insane . he hates everybody . he 's got these plans - you 've got to help me , james . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry for everything . i know i was wrong - but you 've got to protect me . i know you still love -
what about elliot harmsway ? or is this just another one of your stunts ?
nothing .
do n't you even miss me ? did n't i mean anything to you ?
i 've got half the british government breathing down my neck . i do n't have time for your nonsense .
stop it ! you 're hurting me ! ca n't you just be nice ?
is this another one of your games ?
oh , james . i 've missed you -
i thought your specialty was good-bye .
is that any way to say hello ?
paris ? ! ? what are you doing here ?
to the best of my recollection , mr. bond , i suggested no such thing . in fact , i was never here .
political considerations ?
there is one last thing , 007 : elliot harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation . he 's also a major contributor to the party . i expect him to be given every consideration .
need i remind the two of you that elliot harmsway - sir elliot harmsway - is directly descended from the earl of aberdeen ? that his scottish ancestors practically invented hong kong - and out of sheer gratitude , queen victoria herself named the port `` aberdeen harbor '' in their honor ?
perhaps . but it does explain how an ex-kgb agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people . if you believe what you read in the papers .
more scurrilous , unsubstantiated gossip .
occasionally , yes . british media mogul . born in hong kong ; controls newspapers , tv , radio , cable , satellites ; books , magazines , movies , computer software . theme parks .
his newspapers ?
i believe q 's exact words were : `` hopefully , nothing . ''
a wedding band ? ? ? what am i supposed to be able to do with this ?
oh . i almost forgot . there is one last thing : before q retired , he asked that i give you one other protective device .
if you ca n't do the time , do n't do the crime ?
finally , your new watch : blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks ; press this button , the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter .
i see ...
it was an authorized test . i returned the money .
does it work on cash machines ?
moving along - a typical plastic security card . name here , magnetic information stripe here - and a code breaking microprocessor here . swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you 're in .
perfect way to tie up a ... 'knotty ' problem ?
plastique explosive shoelaces . cut them to regulate the size of the blast ; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe .
... shoelaces ?
not from forty feet .
saunders , i 've lit cigarettes -
big game fishing . sonar torpedoes . retirement gift from his friends at the cia .
fishing ?
gone fishing .
how is old q ?
now pay attention , 007. we have n't much time to demonstrate your new q toys .
well ... if you insist .
it must do something .
come on . i know better than that -
q 's retirement party . i 'd just put the knife into the cake , and -
okay , saunders . what is it this time ? rocket in the leg ? machine pistol in the arm ?
i 'm not certain ... but i think there 's someone i want to press for some answers in kuala lumpur .
where to now , jimbo ?
jack wade . citibank . commercial loan division . if you 're ever lookin ' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
sidney winch , meet -
that 's reassuring .
i got you covered .
wait a minute - i 've got it . there ! off the port bow !
they 'd never sail this close to the shore .
who knows ? fog , night ...
i dunno , jimbo . it ca n't be out here . how could they get this far off course ?
he tied one on .
yo ! jimbo ! i won five hundred - what happened ?
hell . the cia built that club .
can you arrange a meeting ?
spends his nights at the kuala lumpur yacht club .
i have to get these to london . do you know this captain cheong ?
we work in the dark . we do what we can .
i envy your 'undercover ' assignments .
she married a hockey player .
yeah . russian minister of transportation .
natalya ?
not if you kill us first - unless that 's how you plan to leave muffy .
i think i 've just seen my next future ex-wife .
seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of bangkok . should have seen his rose garden : blooms the size of hand grenades .
tide and current charts . work backward from the body - find where the ship sank . where did you get the boat ?
what do you want with the harbor master ?
step into my office .
something with an engine ? not oars ?
i do n't know if you 'd call it a boat ...
let 's take a look at the body .
hey - the world is my office .
that 's reassuring .
i am not here , ol ' buddy . the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship , the missing gold , where it was going , or when it left hong kong .
wade , what the hell are you doing here ?
you too .
thanks . take care -
here . i gave you my assistant 's phone number . if it 's urgent , she knows where to reach me .
i did n't think so .
no .
three . you ? married ?
... kids ?
happily .
married ?
depends what number you write .
... does this do anything ?
of course .
do you have a pen ? i just got promoted and do n't have my new cards yet .
they point , i shoot .
interesting video tape .
interesting presentation .
now .
and when might that be ?
if you think we 're going to have some kind of 'life affirming ' romance here just because we cheated death , let me be clear : we 're going to have it where i want , and when i want .
and number two ?
first , that boat is in international waters . i 'm claiming it for salvage . one-third of that gold is mine .
... yes ?
before we go any further here , mr. bond , from lloyds of london , i just want to get two things straight .
... yes ? ? ?
i did n't say when i want to die -
what do you mean , you 'd rather die alone ?
next time , i do the driving .
sleep well ?
we blast through .
if not ?
if it 's radio controlled , it 'll break the code .
you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .
another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?
... you know , that 's another reason you 're probably not in a successful relationship .
here . you shoot . i 'll drive .
it 's a lousy job , but - the only reason i stay is for the health benefits .
is this - like - a normal day for you ?
do n't say it .
sometimes you just have to -
... we have time for that ?
put your arms around my neck . lock your legs around my waist .
are you listening to me ?
put your back to the railing . sit up on it .
trust me .
what now ? and do n't give me some movie clich like 'trust me . '
up .
down ?
cleans dirt . let 's go .
what the hell does that do ?
what do you mean ?
not a lot of difference .
my father left me the business .
... how did you get into marine salvage ?
no . i 'm going with you .
wait here .
the only mistake is that they did n't kill us in the elevator .
this has got to be a mistake .
maybe . but why are we going up instead of down ?
you are seriously deranged .
he 's killed closer .
he was my father 's best friend !
blood or dutch ?
elliot harmsway is my uncle !
harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold . it 's on the sea dolphin ii . and thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - we 're the only ones who can tie him to the crime .
listen to me ! i 'm a british secret service agent . and we have about two minutes before harmsway kills both of us .
that 's funny : you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car .
what ?
... do you have a gun ?
no . i want sir elliot to keep them .
why do n't we just take these -
thank you . `` now hear this : drop dead . ''
just remember : they think there 's ten billion dollars in gold down there .
- you 're not .
if i were you -
- the family jewels ?
and what do you call this ?
think about mom .
i hope you 'll be gentle .
i hope so .
do i have to do everything around here ?
so charming ! so suave ! do n't insult me . i 'm not one of your 'little london girls ' who falls for the lies .
no . first , because i do n't think it 's in your nature . and second , because there 's no gold down there .
no ?
you have to excuse miss winch : she thinks she 's on a 'seduce and destroy ' mission through life ... ... but she wo n't kill us .
- shut up !
let 's not make it a habit .
nice to run into you again .
i see my date is here . and i think mr. bond is ready to leave .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr. bond . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london does n't carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .
insurance . lloyds of london .
and exactly what business are you in , mr. bond ?
actually , i 'm here on business . you might say it was a ... golden opportunity .
so what brings you to kuala lumpur , mr. bond ? wait - do n't tell me : unhappy marriage ? running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in - london ?
pity . bring him whatever he wants .
chaperone . i 'm waiting for my dinner date .
boyfriend ?
no . but you can buy a drink for my friend , taro .
vodka martini , shaken not stirred . and another for you ?
sidney winch .
this afternoon . our boats practically kissed in the harbor . james bond .
have we met ?
- and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake .
sometimes , you just have to plunge into things . be reckless .
i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat .
bourbon . neat .
a three-thousand ton frigate does n't just vanish into thin air .
sabotage ?
the infrared satellite images . no heat , no flame , no explosion . if that boat went down where they said it did , there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface .
it does n't quite add up .
what do you make of all this ?
i have an excellent teacher . 'make sure you wear the uniform ' ?
... you 're turning into quite the politician , 007 .
actually , you 're just in time . admiral roebuck : you know commander bond , do n't you ?
sorry i 'm late -
good luck on your mission , 007 .
... i 'll give you a ring from venice .
hopefully , it wo n't get that far .
but if elliot harmsway is involved with that uranium , i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth .
we serve the interests of the british people , 007. no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect .
... . i hate to ask , but ... did you ever think you 'd miss communism ?
i understand .
you 're to wear this mask at the venice carnival , and wait to be contacted .
yes . 1988. he was furious at the british plan to return hong kong , and supposedly started his own negotiations with the chinese government . the inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn mi-6 a rather powerful enemy -
... did n't we once investigate harmsway ?
which is also why i 've withheld this information from nato and our allies .
of course .
the reason i invited the minister here , 007 , was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion .
it seems , 007 , we 've received a tip
... what 's harmsway done ?
'able to topple governments with a single story ' - as he says in his press .
- along with tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper . circulation 27 million . daily . -
only what i read in the newspapers .
tell me , 007 , what do you know about elliot harmsway ?
of course . minister johnstone .
come in , 007. you know the minister ?
yes , m .
thank you colonel everhart . 007 , i 'd like to see you in my office . why do n't you and the colonel exchange numbers if you need more information ?
tsi tien , professor wu .
tsi tien , mr. bond .
mandarin . you jerk . i 'm late . i have to get dressed .
is that mandarin , or cantonese ?
sakwa !
remind me .
we 've already done the interesting part . do you forget ?
i was just getting to the interesting part !
stop it !
and what do you call these ? the gang of two ?
indeed they are . deadly little things .
ja-shwa tsway . these are lips .
... and what do you call these ?
good-day , miss winch . i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .
you wo n't get away with this !
you leave me no alternative .
no .
hmmm . i suppose this is a step above that profession . ten seconds . are you leaving ?
i was an attorney !
fifteen seconds . perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney .
i know my rights . these are international waters . the british navy abandoned that boat , and i 'm claiming it . under international law , i have the right to salvage what 's on that wreck .
good for you , miss winch . you now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here .
my name is sidney winch , and -
captain morton .
what 's your name ?
who 's wade ?
forget it . no way . i got here first .
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way .
i am . what do you want ?
who 's in charge here ?
excellent .
and the 9:30 news meeting is waiting .
yes -
the queen invited you to dinner -
no -
your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations
send him a $ 10,000 campaign contribution , and explain i have no control over what my journalists write -
the american presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
pencil it in for the next trip -
the canadian prime minister wants to set a lunch -
chew up a log like that in the propeller , you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to london . twice .
aye-aye sir . engines to half .
a dead head . water logged timber . floats straight up . you sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on sumatra - but they do n't usually float this far west . muncy ! engines to half !
seems to be back to normal , sir .
how is it now ?
check it again . what about the global positioning satellite ? could there be something wrong with the signal ?
the back-up does the same thing .
about every ninety seconds , the auto- pilot jogs us to the west .
what 's wrong ?
damn . it 's doing it again .
my timing always was lousy .
how sweet .
no matter what the british government says , i wo n't kill this story . miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator ... and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later .
thank you , uncle elliot .
... well ! i do believe this requires further investigation !
... i see .
he brought that up from the wreck .
- but as i 've explained to sidney , without proof , there 's just no story . do n't you agree mr. bond ?
- i told you ! he was there ! -
obviously , the british government denies all of this -
i see you two have met .
what is he doing here ?
you come with me - you stay here .
take the men . i can finish alone .
a hundred and fifty years ago , my ancestors took this island - a barren , lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization . and now that i 'm being forced to give it back , i intend to return it in exactly the same condition : a barren , lifeless rock . the gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless british government who would n't listen .
you have to leave -
hong kong , mr. bond !
entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
bore through . ... they used to say living well was the best revenge , mr. bond . they 're wrong . revenge is the best revenge .
start the grinders .
approaching the first gate .
please , sidney . i 'd like to remember you fondly .
excellent .
the drill is in the water ; approaching the intake tunnel .
do n't worry . mr. bond will get the message . so will his boss .
that was too close .
kill him ! finish it !
it 's bond !
what the hell is going on ?
no . i have a better idea . in fact , mr. bond may have actually improved my original plan . bring them both to hong kong . and make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve .
yes . shall we kill them ?
- built to withstand a nuclear blast . are they alive ?
i should have hired this man . get somebody up there !
they 're on the bridge . seal off the 50th floor !
get more men up there !
it 's a trick ! after him . they 're in the south stairwell !
good . we have an appointment in hong kong .
fueled and waiting .
is the helicopter ready ?
thank you sir ! thank you !
mr. stamper will escort you to the plane .
... but because i am a just man , i 've decided to give mr. hussein what he deserves .
please sir . please -
you disappoint me , number three .
no sir ! i swear ! this is not true ! !
... and there 's no truth that 10 % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?
yes , sir . but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division . he has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment .
... have n't we already paid him for his services ?
i regret to inform you , sir , that saddam hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war .
yes .
will the cruise set it off ?
soviet sb-9 nuclear torpedo . yield , one kiloton .
abort the cruise .
maybe . maybe not .
will it go off ?
what 's in the box , general ? what 's in the box ? ? ?
i do n't know . he 's not in the database -
who is that ? ! ? what 's in the box ? ?
meaning there may be nuclear material down there ?
kim dae yung . north korean nuclear specialist .
who is it ?
oh , no .
one to seven : deal the face cards .
what about id 's ?
here i am thinking about myself when poor harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen .
soon as i rest a bit . i meant as soon as we are back to normal again , anytime .
when are you boys going to fix that roof ?
they 're too big .
how come you 're not wearing my shoes ?
yes .
babe brother , is that my shirt that you 're wearing ?
oh here we go with that .
junior spends time with his child .
well , you are his grandfather . he is supposed to spend some time with you . you 're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that .
no , it 's that when do you have time to be parents to him ? you guys do n't pick him up until nine , ten at night . you are into yourselves , as the saying goes . spend some time trying to be parents . take him to the mountains , fishing . you ought to let him get to know nature .
why , you do n't want us to bring him over ?
we got the same thing .
what did your wife get her ?
i had n't forgotten . i ordered some cloth but it did n't come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that , i just stayed at home .
your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother 's birthday was last week .
since when ?
i pay my own way .
that 's a lie .
i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late .
what time is it ? do you think you can just treat us like your slave ? it 's after one .
what is it , noontime ?
i 'm cold . i need to get out into the sunlight .
we will take her . you all stay here and watch dad .
i 'll drive her to the hospital .
my name is sam . samuel .
you dumb ass , it 's babe brother .
i 'm leaving and do n't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life . i 'm tired of people saying babe brother this , babe brother that . what 's my name ?
i ought to break your damn neck .
i told you about calling me boy . i ai n't no boy . see , you and dad got a bad habit of calling me boy . you call me boy in front of my wife . you think i 'm going to fix the roof ? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain .
that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you were n't a farmer ; get junior to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell junior to do it . boy , you ought to grow up .
you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son , it is always you , so you fix the roof .
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
i told her i would if she would give me time .
why in the hell did n't you help mama ?
maybe i can get down there next week .
robert asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ?
this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , robert , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .
why are you always afraid to get somewhere ?
you want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours ? you know the last time we went into something together daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street .
you always got something to say .
you used that excuse to get out of the army .
you all do n't believe me when i tell you i 'm afraid of heights .
when are you going to find time to help me fix the roof ?
i guess it proves you really care about me . you hung in there .
and what lesson have we learned from all of this , babe br ... sam ... i mean samuel ?
it was nip and tuck .
do you think you won ?
i could n't believe the things i was doing . it was like an internal struggle going on inside my body .
you were in hell ?
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like .
like muddy waters ?
it 's like i 've been swimming in muddy waters .
like a veil has been lifted ?
i have more sense than to give up everything , my family , you and sunny . it was n't me , i mean the real me inside my body . i 'm glad it 's over . it 's like a veil has been lifted .
i 'm okay . go back to your friends .
you okay ?
why in the h ...
linda , how come you do n't see that sunny puts his shoes on right ?
i do n't need that kind of love . and i do n't want to be reminded all the time that big mama 's grandmother was born in slavery . if you really care about me , just tell me how i can make money .
he is just being like all parents , concerned about the ones they love .
why does he always pick on me ?
i preached to mom and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways , it 's like talking to a brick . but if there is a way ...
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work .
pops put big daddy 's farm in rhonda 's and sunny 's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it .
i told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .
will you still get the money from your father ?
you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean .
i would like to finish reading this . what would i talk about ? i have n't read this month 's almanac . i do n't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes . they pride themselves in making life hard and that 's not my cup of tea .
why do n't you come in for a while ?
how old are you ?
i do n't see you crying about my drinking it .
coffee is bad for anybody , especially for a child .
what is a sip of coffee going to do ?
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddy 's farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama 's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did .
because you were spoiled , do n't try to spoil sunny .
i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start . you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough . you sit right there with your no manners self .
ca n't i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? the world is not black and white . show me one perfect person . if you ca n't , do n't ask me to be .
do n't make me raise my hand to you . you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction .
i 'm busy .
have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling .
harry is coming to pick me up .
i 've heard some foolish things in my life .
i 'm going back home with harry .
what for ?
i need to get my suitcase out of the garage .
well , you look better than you did yesterday .
does n't he look a whole of lot better ?
he will be alright .
this does n't make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air .
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him . it gets cold at night .
babe brother .
who is it ?
we are going where the action is . ai n't that right , okra ? let 's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up . what would you give to be rich ?
this would be a bad time for me to leave .
i do n't want to wear out welcome , but you can stay in someone 's heart longer than you can stay in their house . come with us , boy . we are going to have a good time .
i heard his voice as clear as day . i better get back . maybe something is wrong .
you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there .
i could swear i heard my son call me .
anytime you need someone to do something for you , just let me know .
son , would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom . my hand is too weak . and would you do me another favor ? i do n't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me ? i have trouble bending over .
son , i can take everything you got with that deck . it is marked . now i 'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere .
it is just a regular card .
never play with someone 's else 's cards . you always get a new deck . look at this card . see anything ?
boy , that is the real south . that is real corn liquor .
what is that ?
i do n't know what happened to him . he just ran out into the streets . i got some old records i want you to hear . i like the blues sung simply , man and a guitar . or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life . do n't ever let anyone tell you his life 's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness . when i was a boy , a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i 'll be damned if the same thing did n't happen to me .
do n't pick up the cards if you are not in the game . did he die ?
that is called a crab apple switch . it 's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i do n't know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk 's stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was emory . my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl 's room and he would n't stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
did you ever have to use this thing ?
i 'm not here to argue , sir .
now how far would further out be ?
well , you just have to move further out .
we grow most of our own food . the money i get from social security , my pension and my wife 's work , keeps us living on the edge . what choice do people like us have .
not anymore , not in the city .
i always had chickens , ducks and whatnots .
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock .
it 's only a tale .
i do n't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
but these are white people , anybody . the punch ...
i do n't want to hear any tales about colored people ...
i 'm almost finished . i 'm about to come to the punch line .
i do n't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell . you 're being irreverent .
he 's going to check out heaven first . he gets a round trip ticket to heaven . he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home . people dripping with sweat , working in the fields , hardly surviving . he asked a man who was getting a drink of water , `` i thought the streets were paved with gold . '' `` they are but you wo n't see them , '' he said . `` boy , you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness . '' so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell . he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back , picking their teeth . `` man , this is a dream . '' he asked , `` what 's you 'll doing ? '' they all hollered back , `` sinning . '' the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said , `` please to meet you . '' he asked , `` i thought you 'll was supposed to be burning in fire . '' someone said , `` man , ai n't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins . '' the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth ...
it 's healing now .
what did you put on it ?
i cut it on an old rusty knife .
what happened to your hand ?
since this morning .
gal , you 're talking to john henry . when was i sick ?
you better come sit down . you are still sick .
what , are you having another party ?
how is that hen doing ? i was meaning to pip her before i fell sick .
i need to get out there and get those weeds out .
how is the garden doing ?
you must have been really sick .
it 's good to be able to hear that .
i will appreciate that .
you stay inside . i will see to them .
i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up .
just stay in bed and rest .
i 'm worn out .
no . before anyone moves , you two shake hands and do n't carry it any further .
let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son .
gideon , do n't say things like that .
i would n't care if i drop dead if he learn something from it . son , you make me wish i was dead .
you better be careful . you 'll get a stroke arguing .
no , i 'm too hot now .
do you want your coat ? it 's cold out here .
it would be nice .
well , it 's up to suzie .
babe brother is a poor boy .
you know , babe brother 's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them .
you 're going to find yourself on the floor .
i 'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him .
hush .
you 're always taking his side .
hush .
he ai n't nothing like me . how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart ? you ought to stop protecting him .
you and babe brother are so much alike ...
i 'm not going to let him get away with murder .
you all act like two roosters .
i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes .
go back to sleep .
your feet are cold .
look ! do n't try to get ahead by riding our backs .
let us settle this tomorrow .
i do n't know how two brothers can be so different .
do n't bother the poor boy . it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are .
babe brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation . i hate to be mean to people but picking sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end . now i 'm going to ask him how come he could n't be at your birthday .
everyone is gone . rhonda is in the bathroom .
my mind plays tricks on me . is it okay if i take a bath now ?
i tell you , i feel like a ghost .
boy , i thought you were about to cross the river .
it has n't been the years ; it 's been the men in her life .
have n't the years been good to hattie ?
'course , you could be right . your sons are alive . all my sons are dead .
my daddy called me boy up to the time he died . i was always boy to him .
you still call him boy . you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son .
you 're suppose to teach your children what you know . junior , i do n't have to worry about . babe brother is a different story .
everyone has to follow his own plough . a man does n't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . city people do n't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . you do n't plant old ways ... ... but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you . it 's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they do n't want it . you sell it to a stranger . you worked your whole life , for what ? i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm . all what we 've experienced has no meaning .
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior .
course , it is your business , but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy .
you and babe brother hit it off so well .
everything these days is made overseas .
what could have caused this ? i just changed this damn thing .
it was slow . now it seems like everyone is having births at home .
how often is your wife called to help delivery ?
well , i would appreciate that .
oh , i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you . i have n't wrung a chicken 's neck in a month of sundays . you know , folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs . that used to be my trade from time to time .
i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner , but time got away .
next time when i feel a little better perhaps .
you ought to come hear our preacher . remember old cat iron ? well , our preacher is just as strong .
good morning .
i 'm going to wash up now . you all please excuse me .
it 's the boy next door throwing at his birds . i 'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
that 's awful generous of you . i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome .
man , act like this is your home .
well if you 're sure , i wo n't be a bother . oh , i do n't sleep on no spring mattress . i always make myself a pallet on the floor .
man , put your boxes down and stay as long as you like . we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out .
i 'm worn out but wo n't you feel like you are taking in a stranger ?
stay until you feel better ? i would like to hear all the news .
my feet have never been on anything that was n't directly attached to the ground .
why did n't you catch a plane ?
i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland . the bus stopped in los angeles . i had to get off and take a rest . i 'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight . i 'm just too tired to go on .
he knows better . sunny , apologize to harry .
boy , that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom .
he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age .
this is my grandson , sunny . he is my youngest son 's child .
only if you are a good man , a friend . are you a friend ?
you invited me .
i 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . i have to know who is in my house .
i do n't make no bones about where i 'm going to spend eternity . i have always been wild and you know that . if you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?
hattie is a different person now .
since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .
you must have done something to her .
as god is my witness , i have never done anything to that woman .
good afternoon to you .
good afternoon , ladies .
i made a fresh pot of coffee . okra and i thought you need a rest . i 'll stand guard . okra wants to talk to you anyway .
as long as he keeps his throat clear , he is able to get some rest .
how is he doing ?
only if you can spare it .
let me get you a cup ?
that smells like fresh coffee .
you just run along . i 'll fix him his soup . he will be all right .
can you watch gideon for a while ? one of the girls is going into labor . junior is going to drive me over .
let me earn my keep . i 'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot . try to make him some cow tea next time .
he has never gotten rid of the malaria . he is usually up and at it the next day . i 'm going to make him fresh chicken broth .
i hope that it 's nothing serious .
he was n't able to get out of bed today .
ah , you young folks do n't know how it is . how is gideon today ?
tolerable well .
how is everybody ?
she has a fish bone caught in her throat . could all of you go in the other room ? gideon , get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil .
what 's the problem here ?
you got to know everything , do everything , and be everything .
harry , you know everything .
i 'll be right there .
i have someone i want you to meet .
all those places that us coloreds lived , that we used to call bottoms , have all been changed to drives and heights . everything is in what you call it , not in what it is .
i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him .
you remember that boy who lost his mind , joe ? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark . he would n't miss a one . make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe . he would pick up a brick and say `` go on in there brick and hit somebody '' and it would find its mark .
those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person .
where we come from , you had to know how to act right . you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir . you had to know your place .
one can tell you are from back home . these people nowadays do n't know what manners are .
no , if i rest any longer , i wo n't sleep tonight . may i use your bathroom to wash up a bit ?
you should go back and rest .
good evening . it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary .
well , i do n't want to put you out .
stranger my foot , it was my grandmother who helped you into this world .
emory had made a lot of enemies . he had a big mouth .
you damn right they did n't , especially emory , my cousin .
those boys never did have good luck .
chick was outright killed by a mob . he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him , they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town .
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker , you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick .
strange as it may seem , it might have cleared the waters . sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason .
hocker 's death almost caused a race riot . a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that .
what difference does it make if it 's persimmon , oak tree or huckleberry bush ?
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched . now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree ?
was n't hocker lynched ?
miss clara 's boy , emory , to start with . the johnson 's hocker was another one ...
now who are we talking about ?
there is something that i always wanted to know . tell me , how did those boys die ?
oh , i was n't pointing my finger at you . hey , you have to think of yourself . a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep . there are too many bad people out there .
i do n't know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times .
of course not . have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? no you ai n't . you have to take just one and fatten him up . when you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . if you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . you just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste .
week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger . we ca n't feed all the hungry .
good god almighty , bless your bones . but the problem grows .
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals .
how many people do you all feed ?
well , you and your husband are special . ya , gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor .
that 's nice .
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days .
i already have , my dear .
in the meantime harry can slaughter us a hog .
oh . i 'm sorry . gideon , what do you say ?
is this your house ?
speaking of tappy heads , we ought to have an old fashion fish fry .
an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you , tappy head , you ai n't worth the salt you put in greens .
`` out of weariness , i spoke to my own heart ; to leave it all and to die . and i gave my heart to know madness and folly . ''
i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it .
now i was trying to be nice , to make conversation , since we go back some .
you know the saying , `` your heart is in your left hand . ''
that is a boy from home , lulla 's brother .
none of your business .
my mother passed on years ago .
i know your mother ai n't still operating that house of hers .
some people grow up and change their ways .
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you were n't saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
harry , that 's not nice . i 'm in church now .
no , i 'm a different person now , harry .
girl , do you still sing and dance ?
i could n't believe it when suzie called and said you were staying here . how have you been ?
you never know what 's in the heart and just because you can cry does n't make you human .
all the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering .
ya , but you ca n't do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i 'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
he should be caring . that is not too much to ask .
well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance . do n't take me wrong but you ca n't judge people by how you act . you 're a caring person .
i appreciate you lending me a hand . that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me .
country people got so many strange ways ,
junior 's wife kept her afterbirth ' in the refrigerator . that 's why i do not eat over there now .
some folks take that natural stuff too far .
no . no . no . no . i had my child at cedars and sinai . and that ai n't no county hospital . you have to have cash or check before you come in the door .
did you have your child at home ?
in some things . when we were children , there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you did n't have something on you that did n't make a x .
i thought you were n't old fashioned .
you do n't want to be at crossroads without one . it 's a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .
what 's a toby ?
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago .
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot .
not you must n't touch . your mama might not like you handling knives .
oh , i 'm more modern in my ways . i do n't believe in sin , though there is good and evil . and evil is a thing you work at .
you do n't act like the rest of gideon 's friends . they believe if you are not hard at work , you are hard at sin .
if it was left up to me , i would poison him .
what must i do ?
everybody who have been associated with harry end up with pennies over their eyes .
i ca n't accuse him just dry long 80 .
he 's just raffish . harry put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on route 55 , that old fox .
i asked harry about it . he did n't own up to it . he said he did n't know what got into okra .
rush your mouth , girl . no , he did n't . he can not be that big of a damn fool .
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening .
harry always shows his good side and , like the moon , the other side is black . back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman . i 'm telling you harry is nothing but evil . i 'm warning you -- you ca n't keep a wild animal as a pet around children .
i remember harry always trying to help someone . he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house .
you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt . and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog .
i have n't heard anyone mention swamp root since button-up shoes went out .
no , but i might have some indian chief tonic .
whether the boy hears it or not , the man is still a jackass . everyone should have some mother wit .
you should n't talk about the boy 's father in front of him . this is family business and we have to pull together .
i want to hear what happened . my brother is a jackass and a damn fool . the both of you have been as scarce as hen 's teeth .
now you do n't have to say anything if you do n't want to .
where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends ? they all smell of moth balls .
harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock .
he just leeches off your parents . he is a master at wearing out welcome .
do n't shout !
when did you talk to harry ?
why not ? harry says that 's the only way to do good .
we ca n't really bring another family in here with us .
you know the man next door is near death .
i 'm sorry he got those birds .
he is in his pigeon cage .
where is skip ?
i was just trying to make conversation .
counting the what ? what does that have to do with the price of butter ?
counting the gray hairs in your head .
what are you doing ?
i planted a row just for you and you do n't owe me anything .
but when your sunflowers come up , i 'll pay you for them .
i know you did n't but you have been so thoughtful .
i did n't mean for you to pay me for that .
it is so considerate of you .
tolerably well . i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses .

we 've got to get out of here ... now .
woody ! it 's the moving van .
yes sir !
come on , sheriff . there 's a kid over in that house who needs us . now let 's get you out of this thing .
buzz ! ! what are you doing ? i thought you were --
why would andy want you ? ! look at you ! you 're a buzz lightyear . any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you . you 've got wings , you glow in the dark , you talk , your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a cool toy .
but why would andy want me ?
no , it is . look , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it 's not because you 're a space ranger , pal , it 's because you 're a toy ! you are his toy .
yeah , right .
whoa , hey -- wait a minute . being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger .
no , woody , for the first time i am thinking clearly . you were right all along . i 'm not a space ranger . i 'm just a toy . a stupid little insignificant toy .
oh , buzz , you 've had a big fall . you must not be thinking clearly .
andy 's house . sid 's house . what 's the difference .
why , sure you can , buzz . you can get me out of here and then i 'll get that rocket off you , and we 'll make a break for andy 's house .
i ca n't help . i ca n't help anyone .
oh , come on , buzz . i ... buzz , i ca n't do this without you . i need your help .
years of academy training ... wasted ! !
come on , this way !
out the window ... buzz , you 're a genius !
but -- the hat looked good . tell me the hat looked good ! the apron is a bit much , it 's not my color ...
look at me ! i ca n't even fly out of a window !
sh-h-h-h-h ! ! quiet , buzz .
oh , i 'm a sham ! !
do n't you get it ? ! you see the hat ? i am mrs . nesbit ! !
i think you 've had enough tea for today . let 's get you out of here , buzz .
one minute you 're defending the whole galaxy ... ... and suddenly you find yourself suckin ' down darjeeling with marie antoinette and her little sisters .
what happened to you ?
shhh !

i sure hope this is n't permanent .
oh , great , great . yeah , and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death .
i 've set my laser from stun to kill .
you are the one that decided to climb into this --
what 's gotten into you , sheriff ? i was --

spaceship .
where is it ? i do n't see the --
c'mon , c'mon , that 's it ...

you mean it has hyperdrive ?
wait a minute ! no buzz ! this way ! there 's a special ship . i just saw it !
sorry .
ow ! watch where you 're going !
negative . there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area . we 'll be much safer in the cockpit .
no , no , no , wait , buzz , buzz , let 's get in the back . no one will see us there .
well , then let 's climb abroad .
uh-huh . and when we get there , we 'll be able to find a way to transport you ... home .
now you 're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply ?
go away .
buzz ! buzz , come back !
what ? ! ! what are you talking about ? !
do n't talk to me about importance . because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy .
oh , yeah ? well , if you had n't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
my fault ? ! if you had n't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
this is the perfect time to panic ! i 'm lost , andy is gone , they 're going to move from their house in two days and it 's all your fault ! !
sheriff , this is no time to panic .
shut up ! just shut up , you idiot ! !
according to my nava-computer , the --
no .
but we 're not on my planet , are we ?
oh . oh , that 's good .
i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me , revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet .

i 'd better take a look anyway .
nothing that concerns you spacemen . just us toys .
what 's going on ?
where ?
oh , no , no , no ... buzz , look ! an alien !
you 're mocking me , are n't you ?
you actually think you 're the `` buzz lightyear ? '' oh , all this time i thought it was an act ! hey , guys ! look ! it 's the real buzz lightyear !
oh , yeah , tough guy ? !

nothing is left but us .
everything is gone , now .
so had i .
but then i had a brother and a sister left .
so did i .
i already lost everything once .
all the time .
how long has -
what difference does < i > that < /i > make ?
surely she is older ?
did you now .
i thought she was fondest of you , because you were the youngest .
do you think we should take her up to bed ?
it was only a mouthful !
nothing ... you should n't have given victoria that guinness .
h 'm ?
somebody could n't wait until dark .
i know for a fact he did n't take jonathon . jonathon went off by himself .
reprieve .
in my pocket .
finn ...
i 've got a present for you ...
stop it !
almighty jove in the shape of a swan .
the swan was so ridiculous . all the same , it did scare me .
can you move over a wee bit ?
i hope he does n't pick on jonathon .
he 'll be looking for another apprentice .
he 'll murder you when he finds out .
you did what ?
i finished it off .
you < i > are < /i > cold . where have you been ?
i 'm cold .
finn -
would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while ?
ah , come on now !
well ... yes . all right . but -
can i come into bed with you for a little while , i feel terrible .
let me in .
who 's there ?
living with him put years on me .
you 're not so old yourself !
you 're only a young thing .
do what ? oh , i see .
i wo n't do it because he wants me to do it , even if i want to do it .
what did i do wrong ?
go away .
finn , there 's a splinter in your left foot . if you do n't let me take the splinter out , it will fester .
ah , you should see the swan ! his masterpiece . now , walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell .
is that all ?
that 's your beach . this is the story . leda walks by the shore , gathering shells . night comes on . she hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan . she runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground . curtain .
get away from me ...
what was < i > that < /i > in aid of ?
what about school ?
she 'll have to learn .
she 's not accustomed to being ignored .
i ca n't go home because there 's no home left .
home is where the heart is .
i want to go home .
i did n't know about the puppets . it 's a lot to take in , all at once .
do n't fret . it 's only his dream . dreams are n't catching , not like measles .
did n't you know he made things ?
it 's as though he 'd trapped a real cuckoo inside .
he made that . in his off hours .
she got away .
mummy was scared of him , i think . he went to her wedding but he was < i > furious < /i > , you can see it in the photograph .
he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf , but , his bite is worse than his bark , is n't that so , old fellow ?
i saw his teeth in the bathroom .
speak when you 're spoken to . he likes his women quiet .
is there anything else i should know about him ?
slip up and change into a skirt , else he 'll create something terrible . do n't you want to make a good impression on your first day ?
a sin against < i > what ? < /i >
he ca n't abide a woman in trousers . he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature .
i carried you up to your bed .
i did like the music .
curled up on the landing like love locked out !
you 're spoiling your pretty looks . come here .
i like plaits .
do you know you 've lovely hair , even if you torment it in those braids .
he 's a pyjama case , really .
excuse me .
i can manage .
there 's not .
there 's no mirror .
you 'll put your clothes here .
there 's no law , as i know of , to prevent it .
but you 're irish !
you 'll need to know who we are , we 're the brothers of his wife , which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way , your uncles . me name is finn , me brother is called francie -
in the play . she was married , by my age . and mummy . mummy was n't much older than me when she got married . well , not < i > that < /i > much older .
juliet who ?
i 'm not too young . juliet was my age .
we 're too young .
they 're going to fly everywhere . mean things . they should have taken us .
storms ?
'have ploughed the stormy seas - '
it 's all right , finn .
oh no you ca n't . get on with the painting .
i wanted my leda to be a little girl . leda and the swan . see ?
sixteen . well , nearly sixteen .
you 're well built ; how old are you ?
what ? did you let that child play with one of my toys ? i do n't like children playing with my toys . have to fix you up with another hammer , wo n't we . give her a saucepan to play with , that 'll do .
victoria -
did you do this ?
you 're late for breakfast .
i 'm melanie .
well , i hope it stays that way .
no , of course not . she 's one of the top students at her school .
is she in any kind of therapy ... professional help ?
i ... i do n't really know .
i mean , did you ask her ? what kind of drugs has she tried ?
i do n't know what you mean .
one thing bothers me ... that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he 's lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what 's your daughter on ?
like i said , open container , p.i. , misdemeanor possession . easy to make it disappear . for you , poof , it 's gone .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .
judge wakefield , it 's an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she 's a minor ; it probably would 've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway .
i appreciate you coming in so early .
you will believe me , because it 's true .
i want to believe you . i really do .
if manolo had n't gone and told them what he did then salazar and madrigal would never have been brought to justice . he did a great thing for tijuana . he did a great thing for mexico .
well , you know , he 's going to say about madrigal ... and salazar .
what is he planning on telling them ?
nine thousand dollars .
how much ?
he has debts . he has gambling debts . he owes a lot of money .
why does he need money ?
it 's very hard for me to come and tell you this .
what ? what is it ?
no .
he never came home last night . was he with you ?
he 's not here .
i ca n't find manolo .
anna . what 's wrong ? what do you want ?
he 's right . they 'll do it when you 're walking somewhere , make it look like street crime .
even if that were true , they 're not going to come to your house where you 're waiting for them .
it 's the same . what happened to what they gave you ?
it 's the same stuff ? from the rainy day stash ?
what are you thinking , calling me at home with a message like that ? you 've compromised me and our relationship --
did you get it ?
i ca n't do that .
i need an introduction to the obregon brothers .
helena --
i know i made things worse . i know that and i 'm sorry , but arnie i need something from you . something only you can help me with .
helena , please . this is out of your hands .
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .
have you gone crazy ? you are not carl . you are n't as good as carl . they are moving the trial to a high security location . the press has gone berserk . the jury will be influenced . stay out of things . let us try to win the case .
i tried , arnie . and , i will continue to try .
that was a stupid thing you did . incredibly stupid .
i 'm glad you think so , but i 'm picturing a debt-ridden , thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to pablo escobar . and i 'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that ?
i remember when i first met you : little helen watts from the wrong side of somewhere . i had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed .
sometimes i wonder what i 'll do if carl does n't get out . i 'm not very adept at being on my own . i 've always had a man in my life . always .
do n't you have some good news ? is n't there something positive you could say .
laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , carl had only one successful business .
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
even if i knew i would n't tell you . you do not want to come into contact with these people . only carl knows who they are . that 's his real asset . ruiz does n't know them . they do n't know ruiz . church and state .
please . tell me who carl sells to .
yes , i told you before , there are people who owe you money but they 're not paying . there 's too much heat on carl .
arnie , help me . does n't anyone owe us money ?
helena , if i had it i would give it to you , but i do n't have that kind of money .
arnie , i need money . somebody threatened my children . they want a first payment of three million dollars .
this place is swept twice a day . i learned that in miami in '85 . then the u.s. shut down the whole caribbean , but it 's a big game of wack-a-mole . knock it down in miami , it pops up here . and san diego is so much more relaxing .
i suspect he 'll accept his payment in publicity .
how much do i pay him ?
you 're gon na get through it , but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl . we get adler and we beat this thing .
if all our assets are frozen and our `` sales force '' has scattered ... how am i supposed to survive ? i 'm giving birth in three months . how do i get through this ?
of course he is . i 've known him for twenty years and he does n't jaywalk ...
i am on the board of my son 's school . i had a fundraiser for a.l.v . in my front yard . i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman .
that 's a very apt analogy , helena . now , go home and be with your children .
arnie , i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass .
i do n't know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened . that is very important .
what is he being charged with ?
got it ? good . do not discuss anything over the telephone . do not talk to the neighbors . stay out of your yard .
arnie , this is crazy .
good . from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded , that the movement of your lips is being read . got it ?
listen to me carefully . first of all , carl is n't here . dea 's got him and they 'll hang on to him until arraignment , which will probably be tomorrow . so here you 're wasting your time . are you with me ?
why are you talking like that ?
i understand . you 're upset . you want to know what 's going on . that 's good .
arnie , thank god .
helena , i 'm so sorry --
goodbye arnie .
carl --
arnie , do think there 's a difference between a reason and an excuse , because i do n't think there is .
carl , think about it , if i was trying to rip you off , i would have left town after ruiz was killed . i would n't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal .
so my wife is lying ?
carl , that 's insane .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , arnie .
i just did n't want to take a chance . i did n't want to risk it . it could have been frozen along with everything else .
and you did n't feel like you could trust my wife with this news ?
i was just waiting for the right time .
so arnie , when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from san francisco two days after i got arrested ?
what ?
do n't bother .
carl , i 'm running late . i 'm coming right now --
it 's saturday , arnie . you work too hard .
she 'll be at a pawn shop in an hour .
where are you going ?
at least she 's alive .
so 's the video camera .
my leica 's gone .
i do n't know .
god , i do n't get it . are we supposed to say to ourselves , be prepared to lose her , be prepared to lose our child ? why does this happen to someone ? how does it happen ?
me , too .
about the other night , i 'm sorry .
no , not yet .
should we bring the police into this ?
yeah , because the alternative is to be bored to death .
oh , it is ?
i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day . that 's different .
i 'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello .
yeah , well , she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar , too .
no , i do n't think so . leave me alone , give me money . that 's what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .
look , i 'm as worried as you are --
if you start in on the war metaphors i 'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole .
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front .
because i 'm at the edge of my capabilities , robert .
barbara --
you might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter .
does this mean you 're going to be gone more ?
i think we may have found our mexican drug czar . it 's this general , salazar . at least i 'll have somebody on the other side i can talk to .
she asked me not to .
explain to me how you could think that i should n't know about this . explain to me how this would n't be relevant to me . as a parent .
six months . i found some marijuana , that 's all . and a little pipe about two inches long . i talked with her . she said her friends smoked pot and drank --
how long have you known ?
we do n't want to push her away . these are growing experiences .
space for what ? to o.d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it is n't . correct ?
i think she has to find out for herself , on her own . we have to allow her space --
to begin with , she 's only sixteen years-old .
why ?
this is different .
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ?
stop . you experimented in college . i do n't want to hear about that .
honey , this is difficult , but we 've all had our moments . i tried --
we 'll ground her , clip her wings a bit . school and scheduled activities and that 's it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . dan kelly , in the district attorney 's office , will probably help us out , quietly . christ , this could be embarrassing .
me , too .
i think she 's lying .
it 's so frustrating .
that 's frustrating .
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel , none of whom had any expertise . superfund is just one of those words . people stop paying attention .
drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . canada is completely overwhelmed .
like a grateful dead concert .
he 's a friend . he 's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation . he 'd definitely had a few beers , but it 's not like he wanted to drive . we did n't know what else to do . it was n't my pot .
how well do you know this boy , seth , who was driving ? you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana .
he did n't hang around us . he 's like one of those hippie kids . i 'm not part of that group . it was a party in all these rooms . his girlfriend who i barely know was completely hysterical ... he 's blue , he 's puking ... we did n't want to get in trouble , but what were we supposed to do ? i mean , what would you have done if you had been us ?
what do you think ?
is this bad for him ?
i do n't know .
are you going to ?
not yet .
did you tell dad ?
sorry , but i mean , come on .
caroline --
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar .
that makes mom the czarina . i 'm a czarette . like anastasia .
czar for life , just like a real czar .
honey , your father knows the president .
did you meet the president ?
tell me what to do , carl . i need guidance , not a fucking platitude . i 'm not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with . i wo n't do it . i want our life back .
helena --
how ? supportive letters from prison while i 'm being kicked out of our home ? do you have any idea what is happening out here ? our credit cards are maxed . the people at the bank , you should see their faces when i walk in there . i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien . our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging . nobody will help us . nobody will take us in . nobody wants anything to do with us . so tell me , carl , how you 're gon na make it up to me . tell me again how we 'll get through this , and maybe while you 're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection .
we 'll get through this , i promise . i 'll make it up to you --
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i do n't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you 're coming back ... or if you 're coming back .
helena --
how 's david ? how 's david ? he 's terrific , carl .
how 's david ?
i keep feeling like i 'm forgetting something .
you all right ?
i got that . how was your day ?
just watching you .
what 's up ?
hi .
hi .
oh , yes i can .
you ca n't make me .
what is wrong with you ? what ? you 're going away . you 're getting help somewhere .
like i give a fuck .
okay , young lady , that 's it .
fuck you . i was n't doing anything . you 're like the gestapo .
where is it ? where are the drugs ? where are they ?
it 's a presidential appointment so ... until i quit or get fired .
how long 's the job ?
i do n't know .
will we get invited to the white house ?
as it happens , the president of the united states , my new boss , the leader of the free world , has me penciled in for some `` face time '' .
somehow , i do n't see that happening .
what if every country legalized at the same time ?
fine -- legalization . okay , forgetting all of our international trade agreements , legalize everything today . the government inserts itself into all drug transactions . the u.s. becomes a giant pharmacy . our borders are mobbed , lines of people from here to europe wanting to smoke , snort and shoot themselves into oblivion .
what about legalizing everything ? has anybody talked about that ?
what 's it like ? imagine you 're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta , except the beggars are wearing $ 1500 suits and they do n't say `` please '' or `` thank you . ''
i 'm a national merit finalist . i 'm on the hi-q team and the math team . i 'm in the spanish club . i 'm a thespian . i 'm vice-president of my class . i 'm on the volleyball team .
you do ? what else you do ?
i get a 's . all a 's .
what 's that mean ?
i 'm third in my class .
how are your grades ?
yeah .
private ?
cincinnati country day .
in school ?
i volunteer . i read to blind people . one day a week for two hours .
do you work ?
yes .
parents still together ?
yes .
live with your parents ?
sixteen
... how old are you ?
why ? nobody 's there .
i think so . if she did n't she should have . i 've only got maybe an hour . then volleyball practice is over and i have to be home .
did courtney love play nancy in syd and nancy ?
then here 's a little bump .
yes , mom --
have you done your homework , honey ?
yeah , then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day .
maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
you know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day ? he and my mom have cocktail hour every night , from six to seven , set your clock , two bourbons --
he 's gon na fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
are you kidding ... i 'm staying with you --
we live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us .
ach , that 's what i 'm talking about . sarcasm . always fucking sarcasm . you 're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you 're weak or wo n't like you --
not like . it is .
what is this , like freebase ?
inhale the smoke and hold it .
just watch .
what are you doing ?
yeah , like turning into a beautiful woman .
oh , man , i 've never eaten so good in my life . why do n't you develop a useful skill ?
remember when we sat on that mob guy , that chef , for like six months ?
she 's your girlfriend . open it , talk about your kids .
what do you think she wants ?
i do n't know .
what do we do ?
i love my job . i love it . the next time i 'm having a bad day you got ta remind me of right now and i 'll get over it .
are you getting this on tape ?
winners do n't do coke . or have n't you been reading the bumper stickers ?
he won . he was a winner . that bothers you .
maradona is a cokehead . hand of god , my ass . we 're wasting our time here .
you should see little montel play . little montel is the next maradona .
you want to make a wager on this ?
so does half of san diego .
she knows arnie metzger .
i 'm telling you , she does n't know shit .
i have dreams about this , actual dreams about busting the top people , the rich people , the white people .
she ai n't in on it .
they 're whispering . i ca n't hear them , but i know it . i smell conspiracy . i feel the lie vibrating out of the home .
who do you work for ?
that 's a big word for a fisherman .
we got you on tape making the deal . we got you bragging about the quality . we got you bragging about your business . we got you .
move 'em to texas , fry 'em up .
it 's a funny fuckin ' joke and it 's quick . why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
chill out --
nope .
no more pissant basin league bullshit for us , hunh ?
i feel good .
no telltales . nothing to read . not touching my face . not even blinking . no giveaways . how 're you feeling ?
medicinal marijuana initiative . or am i being cynical ?
arizona .
depends on the state .
what would a law firm want from the new drug czar ?
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff . three categories : you like me , you hate me , you want something from me . definitely third category .
your friends at warren , putnam and hudson .
depends who it 's from .
what do you think it is ?
yeah !
women 's room , stall two . should we stop for ice-cream ?
we 're playing !
david --
especially tiger woods . ... actually , he keeps his on the back seat .
not tiger woods .
all the professionals keep them in the trunk .
no --
i 'll put this in the back .
what are you ? a mouse ? get out of the car and do it . this is your chance .
they 're going to walk right past me .
there 's always a way . if people get to the pope or the president , you can get to him .
i do n't know . eduardo ruiz is the only real witness against carl . the security is very tight . there may not be a way .
when will you do it ?
i do n't really like guns . you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive .
you 're kidding . ca n't you shoot him or something ?
you were followed by the police , but they wo n't hear us over the children . i want to use a bomb .
i have a job for you and i do n't have much time .
you may speak .
i 'm on a special phone , may i speak freely ?
yes .
you only got to me because you were tipped off by the juarez cartel , who 's trying to break into tijuana . you 're helping them . you work for a drug dealer too , monty .
so go shower already .
the worst thing about you , monty , is you realize the futility of what you 're doing and you do it anyway . i wish you could see how transparent you are . this food tastes like shit .
you 're breaking my heart .
ca n't you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . do n't you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?
that thought makes me feel awful .
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder .
when the dea gets into the narcotics business , then we 'll stay at the four seasons .
this is ridiculous . why is there no elevator ?
carl and i were friends from childhood . he was loyal , that 's not a mistake .
he hired you . that was a mistake .
i got greedy . i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off . that was my mistake . carl would never be so stupid .
this attitude 's not gon na help him any , is it ?
in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity , this is not so true for the usa . using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search . the odds are not high , and we found variables that reduce the odds . we hire drivers with nothing to lose . then we throw a lot of product at the problem . some get stopped . enough get through . it 's not difficult .
so you pay off our customs officials ?
carlos , i mean carl , started out in the family connection business : real estate in tijuana , fishing boats out of ensenada , hydroponic raspberries . he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in two things : entering society and using his fishing boats .
we can protect you .
it 's a death sentence . i 'll never make it to the trial .
one chance here , eduardo . make us believe you got a boss . no boss , it 's all on you .
the amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states .
you ca n't visit me here . i want my lawyer .
listen you motherfucker , you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon .
i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . tuna . check it out . tax records , everything --
you planning on going somewhere , eduardo ? you do n't like it here ? this is the best situation you 're going to have for a long , long time .
nobody said shit , eduardo --
so , it 's worth the wait , right ? what can i do ? rent a huey ? have an airlift ? it 's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule 's asshole , right ? how many peasants would that take ? a line stretching from here to mexico city --
you will dine with me from now on .
i do n't know , sir .
bring this man a change of good clothes . has he eaten ?
yes , sir !
we are n't barbarians .
yes , sir !
i want to know who is responsible for this treatment .
deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego . and we have a deal .
you will help me with my other problem .
exactly , and this is how i know i 'm not getting into business with the u.s. government .
that 's crazy . my husband is on trial for smuggling .
take this back with you . deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal .
perhaps ... perhaps ... i 'm afraid i must first ask you to pass a test . i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors .
it should be ... it 's yours . i want our debt forgiven . i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states . and i want the principle witness against my husband , eduardo ruiz , killed .
that 's good coke .
fine , then we do n't have a deal .
fine , then we do n't have deal .
i 'm six months pregnant . i wo n't do it .
you first .
i do n't believe you .
every part , from his ears to his accessory belt , is high-impact , pressure-molded cocaine . odorless . undetectable by dogs . undetectable by anyone .
not in ...
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr. espastico jacobo . that 's nothing new .
we have the ability to change the color , odor , and physical property of cocaine .
i do n't know . perhaps i remember something .
my husband had been working on something he called , the project for the children . are you aware of this ?
but not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt .
there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico .
you do n't ? listen to this woman in a man 's world , a very violent world .
i do n't think you 're going to do that .
that is not true , mrs. ayala . your route is compromised . perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california .
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization , not ours .
i hear these stories . your husband in jail . his business in chaos . various people fighting over the scraps .
why do you say that , mr. marquez ?
no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it 's been a pointless journey .
yes , he threatened to kill my five year-old son . i was under the impression i would be meeting juan obregon .
we keep our mouths shut .
javi ! come on . do n't pull this you do n't care bullshit . this is incredible information . it must be . javi --
porfirio madrigal is not dead . i just saw him .
what ?
madrigal 's alive .
go home . get cleaned up . get to work . salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and i 'm not getting left behind . do n't fuck this up .
no , but a lot of other people . you should come . you should come out with us .
oh , really . general salazar was there ?
it 's no problem . i was just with everybody we work with .
not this time .
yeah . it should be fun . you wan na come ?
your new friends .
guzman , tomas , esteban --
who ?
a group of us are going out tonight .
then i guess i 'm going by myself .
this is fucking crazy . instead of killing us , he sends us on a suicide mission . do you know who frankie flowers is ? he 's a psycho-cokehead- hitman . a faggot . he 's killed fucking who knows how many people . you 'd need half the force to get close to him . and you ca n't get their help because he lives in fucking san diego .
the police wo n't find your car .
please . filing a report will not help you find your car .
anyway , i do n't think we 'll ever see them again . everything 's back to normal .
she 's nosy . she hears me on the telephone .
if you want her to stay out of it , then stop telling her everything . you should learn how to keep a secret .
they would n't do it in front of all these people . they 'd send someone later , when we 're alone .
relax . if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert .
i do n't know . something .
what 's he doing up here ?
yeah .
was n't that general salazar ?
i feel like a traitor .
you should feel good about this .
this is a very different proposition .
we thought maybe you 'd have that kind of information for us .
so ... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations .
we agree .
it 's important that we work together . mexico . america . one hand washing the other .
no .
a place we have , that we know is protected .
where ?
somewhere safe .
when he loves me like a father , he will never tell anyone he was here . he will freely give the names of his superiors . then we get them and they too will give us names . and eventually somebody will get us to juan obregon and the cartel will fall .
but will he be house-trained ?
you watch and learn . i earn his trust . then more pain . then i appear with kindness . within a week he will follow me around like a dog .
everybody has a weakness .
i 'm curious how you did this with such economy .
he 'll do what i say .
only if he can be trusted .
does this offer include my partner ?
a small thing . nothing really .
what is it you want me to do ?
i 'm trying to bust the tijuana cartel .
if i can .
that 's your past . i want to talk about your future . would you be willing to do something for me ?
it was an anonymous tip .
what is the name of your informant ?
an informant .
one question . how did you find about this ?
well , javier rodriguez , you 've done a very good job , but we 'll take care of it from here .
javier rodriguez .
what 's your name ?
is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who is n't connected in some war to one of the cartels ?
it 's possible .
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power ?
it could mean that , yes .
let me ask you a hypothetical question : if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel , and he went out of power , would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ?
so what 's it doing in tijuana ?
i 'm aware of that .
the cocaine brand , 911 , is an east coast brand , a juarez cartel brand , and you must know it usually comes through into el paso ?
if i ever return to the bench , counselor adler , i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments .
i hope when you were on the bench , judge wakefield , you did n't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion .
last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country .
noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u.s. government . so , no , i do n't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government , fighting people like you , trying to keep this system a little bit honest .
noriega is a criminal .
we kidnapped noriega out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ? because it is n't in mine .
michael , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
the worst serial killer in history - who ? gacy - right ? killed forty two people . our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day .
which part , getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities ?
my work keeps me young .
right . but , that 's not the biggest problem . one of our intel officers picked up information from dea that traffickers have come up with a process , a chemical process , to turn coke into something else . it does n't smell like coke . it does n't look like coke . and what 's worse , it does n't react to field test . it could be anything . maybe it 's already happening . i mean , how would we know ?
that triple the amount of stuff is going through .
sure . more money in intelligence on their side of the border . so we have a better idea who we 're looking for . more dogs . more people . supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through . outside of martial law that 's about the best you 're gon na do . but , i should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . in the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we 're pulling over the same number of cars . what does that tell you ?
any way we can do it better ?
we ask questions and measure the answers . when something does n't ring true , a fact that does n't make sense , a slight hesitation , then it 's off to secondary for a closer look . before nafta we had about 1.9 million trucks a year . now it 's almost double . pretty soon there 'll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .
what do you look for ?
i 've read official estimates but i would n't bet my house on them . i 've heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers . at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who do n't give a damn if they 're caught or not .
any idea how much ?
the busiest land border crossing in the world . over forty-one thousand vehicles per day , twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot . i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through .
just tell me where she is .
i want your money , i 'll take your money .
i 'll pay you a thousand dollars . i have it in my wallet .
i got money .
i have money --
who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i should n't just put you in a dumpster ?
i need to find my daughter . i 'll pay you .
this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
i 'm looking for my daughter , caroline . she comes here .
hey man , back the fuck up . to this place . what 's that shit ? right now , all over this country , a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see , you got any drugs ? you know where i can get drugs ? what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person , on their possibilities ? if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood , indian hills , and they asked every white person they saw , hey , you got any drugs ? , within a day , your friends and their kids would be selling . it 's market forces , man . the product 's marked up three hundred percent . you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day . you think white people would still be going to law school ?
i ca n't believe you used to bring my daughter here , to this place .
i do n't know , maybe we missed her .
you want to help ? stay the fuck away from her .
hey man , i 'm sorry . i 'm just trying to help .
you do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . you 're a cocky seventeen year-old and you do n't have a clue what the stakes are . you do n't know the value of the life you 've yet to throw away . and neither does she .
the west end . we buy it off the streets . i can stop , you know , and she ca n't . two people , really similar , we can talk about anything , but for me it 's like a weekend thing , then i get my shit together , and for her it 's different --
what ?
we sometimes went downtown to score .
i do n't give a fuck about your parents --
you wo n't say anything to my parents ?
i 'm not the police . i do n't care about experimentation . she 's a kid . i 'm worried to death .
i do n't know what to say .
can you tell me anything ? do you have any ideas ?
i tried to talk to her when she was up there , but they would n't put me through . i 'm surprised she has n't called .
she has n't called you ?
oh , man --
she snuck away . and we have n't seen her . she has n't come home .
she 's not at that place you sent her ?
addicts treat themselves ... they overdose and then there 's one less to worry about .
let me ask you a related question . we 've talked about the supply side , but what about demand ? what is your policy for treating addiction ?
yes , i hope so as well .
hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem .
yes , i am confident that juan obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year . but , you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force . we get a tip that he is one place , then we get there and he is already gone , having been warned by someone on our side .
you 've been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel .
that would be very helpful to me . also , i received the offer from dea and the fbi to train some of my men at quantico . i think this will be extremely useful , a good way for us to absorb some of your methods .
i 'd like to bring you up to washington , walk you around our side of things , and share some of the information we 've been able to develop on your cartels .
i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process . not only physical , but also psychological .
if we 're moving the press conference , we need to do it now . are you all right ?
i 'll get there as soon as i can .
apparently not . look , it 's a shit storm here right now . when are you coming back ? i do n't know what to tell people any more .
what ? i thought madrigal was dead . i thought it was verified .
salazar 's been taken down . he was working for porfirio madrigal .
i 'm sorry ... did i wake you ?
hello .
i see where you 're going with that , but if i could just say something , which is basically that a guy like landry is so autocratic he does n't know how to let himself be helped ; it 's a point of pride to take every bullet , no matter who fired it , or whether it was even aimed at him , which personally i think it very self-defeating . now , do n't get me wrong , he 's a man of enormous integrity , but there 's a political component to this job that the general just did n't have any patience for .
like you protected landry ?
i just want to be clear about one thing . i used to work for him , but now i work for you . i 'm not a partisan person , i 'm an issue person . in the next few weeks , if you allow me , we 'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues . the most important of which , in my opinion , being mexico . i know everybody that you 're gon na meet . it 's important that they like you . it 's not important that they like me . that 's why i can help protect you .
i do n't know . i do n't think there 's any one person . see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody , all the property on the mexican side , sometimes all the property on both sides . warehouses , transportation , even tunnels . it 's very organized .
i mean , who runs interdiction on the mexico side ?
what do you mean ?
who do we interface with on their side ?
right . now it 's used by somebody from the juarez cartel , one of his lieutenants ... who knows ? every damn day there 's birthday party . at first i thought they must have three hundred children , then i realized they 're taunting us . three miles away and we ca n't touch them . ha , ha , ha .
he died in a liposuction surgery , right ?
agents who died in the field .
who are these guys ?
it 's three a.m. i 'm not supposed to be here . i snuck out --
mapping the fucking pig genome . we 'll call your dad , he 's a neurosurgeon --
what kind of research ?
he 's a research doctor . you 're dad 's a doctor , too --
your dad 's a doctor . call him --
what do we do ? okay . fucked-up bowman 's turning blue . doctor . we need a doctor .
you 'll never catch us , you flabby bastard . right , see , when i come back --
i 'll be right after you .
i 'm off for a pish . when i come back , that money 's still here , ok ?
ok. same again ?
christ .
because i fucking told you to do that , you doss cunt .
well , why did n't you bring them ?
bit fucking late , like .
i 'm sorry .
it 's fucking boring after a while without the cards .
well , i 've not brought them .
it 's fucking boring after a while without the cards .
well , i 've not brought them .
the cards . the last thing i said to you was mind the cards .
what ?
no . on you go .
did you tell him ?
you were in my way .
you 've stabbed me , man .
shut you mouth or you 'll be next .
you daft cunt . if you 're going to waste it like that , you might as well leave it all to me . now get the drinks in .
no , i do n't mean like that -- i mean something nice , like , that 's all --
shag her senseless .
i do n't know , maybe i 'll buy something for my ma , and then buy some good speed , no bicarb like , then get a girl , take her out like , and treat her -- properly .
if everyone keeps their mouth shut , there 'll be no one going to jail .
i want the money , mark , that 's all .
sorry 's no going to dry me off , you cunt .
look , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it .
all down my fucking front , you fucking idiot .
sorry , mate , i 'll get you another .
for fuck 's sake .
ninteen .
but it 's not worth more than fifteen .
twenty thousand .
not sorry enough for being a fat cunt .
cool down , franco . the guy 's sorry .
i guess you would , franco .
i 'd fucking kill you .
we 'll be half-way down the road with the money .
for four fucking grand ? one palm tree , a couple of rocks , and a sewage outflow .
buy yourself that island in the sun ?
did you bring the cards ?
this was his nightmare . the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town . i knew what was going on in his mind : any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately , one way or another . he had to . if he got caught with a bagful of skag , on top of that armed robbery shit , he was going down for fifteen to twenty . begbie was hard , but not so hard that he did n't shite it off twenty years in saughton .
four kilos . that 's what -- ten years ' worth ? russian sailors ? mikey forrester ? what the fuck are you on these days ? you 've been to jail , spud , so what 's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again ?
two thousand , one hundred and thirty- three pounds .
jesus .
yes , you fucking do . i 've seen your statement .
let 's face it , it could have been wonderful .
i 'm no a fucking buftie and that 's the end of it .
i 'm a fugitive from the law . i ca n't be seen on the fucking streets . now watch my lips . kempton park . two-thirty . five pounds to win . bad boy .
can you not go yourself .
hey , i 'm wanting a bet put on .
i 've no fucking cigarettes .
what ?
too right it is . now look , have you got anything to eat , 'cos i 'm fucking lee marvin , by the way .
it 's a scandal , franco .
aye , ok , fr . but the good times could n't last for ever .
and remember , rents : no skag .
well , he 's young and he 's healthy .
so , what 's he like ?
what do you think -- i should be carrying a torch for you ?
happy birthday .
sixteen next month .
and what age are you ? thirteen ? fourteen ?
that 's right : 'going steady ' for four weeks now .
what ? steady like ?
i 've got a boyfriend , mark .
well , you 're not going to tell anyone , are you , and besides , i thought we could meet up afterwards , maybe go somewhere together .
so why have you told me about it ?
so long as everyone keeps their mouths shut , we 'll not be getting caught .
unless you get caught .
it 's so simple . we buy it at four grand , we punt it at twenty to this guy that sick boy knows , and he punts it at sixty . everyone 's happy , everyone 's in profit . i put up two . i come away with six .
the point is , you 've got to find something new .
iggy pop is not dead . he toured last year . tommy went to see him .
whatever . i mean , the guy 's dead anyway .
it 's iggy pop .
you 're not getting any younger , mark . the world is changing , music is changing , even drugs are changing . you ca n't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop .
too young for what ?
you 're too young .
smells like it .
well , it is n't .
i would n't mind a bit , if it is .
no .
calm down , i 'm just asking . is that hash i can smell ?
yes , as a matter of fact , it is .
is that a promise , then ?
yes .
are you clean ?
what do you want ?
certainly not .
can i see you again ?
easy for you to say .
calm down . you 're not going to jail .
and that 's what 's illegal . do you know what they do to people like me inside ? they 'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet .
in that case you can do it . you were quite happy to do a lot more last night .
no , not holding hands .
holding hands ?
because it 's illegal .
i do n't see why not .
and do n't make any noise .
jesus .
no argument . you can sleep on the sofa in the living room , or go home . it 's up to you .
come on .
out .
what ?
right . you ca n't sleep here .
christ , i have n't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 .
shut up .
sorry .
ssshh !
diane .
think i left something back at the -
well , what 's wrong , boy ? cat got your tongue .
eh-
do you find that this approach usually works , or , let me guess , you 've never tried it before . in fact , you do n't normally approach girls , am i right ? the truth is that you 're a quite , sensitive type but if i 'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you : witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal , a little bit crazy , a little bit bad , but , hey , do n't us girls just love that ?
i 'll come back if you like , but i 'm not promising anything .
what ?
great .
it 's where i live .
where 's that ?
i 'm going home .
where are you going , diane ?
diane .
what 's your name ?
thanks .
excuse me , i do n't mean to harass you , but i was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation . i thought to myself : she 's special .
he forgot . useless motherfucker .
what happened ?
what , and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him ? did i tell you about my birthday ?
actually it 's a nightmare . i 've been desperate for a shag , but watching him suffer was just too much fun . you should try it with tommy .
it 's an interesting theory .
i read it in cosmopolitan .
i did n't either . what the fuck is it ?
exactly . i 'm not wanting a cat , she says . get to fuck , right . so there 's tommy stuck with this kitten . you can imagine what happened . the thing was neglected , pissing and shitting all over the place . tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers . he did n't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit .
i bet lizzy told him where to put it .
eh ? how 's that ?
no , toxoplasmosis . sort of like a stroke .
what was it , pneumonia or cancer ?
tommy knew he had the virus , like , but never knew he 'd gone full-blown .
returned it ? where ? to the video shop , tommy ? to the fucking video store ? so every punter in edinburgh is jerking off to our video ? god , tommy , i feel sick .
it 'll be here somewhere . i might have returned it by mistake .
what do you mean , it 's 'gone ' ? where has it gone , tommy ?
fuck , ok .
yes , i want to watch ourselves while we 're screwing .
now ?
tommy , let 's put the tape on .
exactly . those very words have been my guiding light in what is , after all , a dark and often hostile world .
strive , hope , believe and conquer .
of course , the motto , the motto --
do you recall the school motto ?
oh , really ?
i 'm an old boy myself , you know ?
oh , yes , indeed . i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection . the debating society , the first eleven , the soft know of willow on leather --
one of edinburgh 's finest schools .
indeed , yes , those halcyon days .
well , mr. renton , i see that you attended the royal edinburgh college .
the pleasure was mine . best interview i 've ever been to . thanks .
thank you , mr. murphy . we 'll let you know .
hey . right . no problem . whatever you say , man . you 're the man , the governor , the dude in the chair , like . i 'm merely here . but obviously i am . here , that is . i hope i 'm not talking too much . i do n't usually . i think it 's all important though , is n't it ?
you were referred here by the department of employment . there 's no need for you to get you `` foot in the door '' , as you put it .
only to get my foot in the door . showing initiative , right ?
mr. murphy , do you mean that you lied on your application ?
no , actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you would n't have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead , because they 're both schools , right , and we 're all in this together , and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details , yeah ? people get all hung up on details , but what 's the point ? like which school ? does it matter ? why ? when ? where ? or how many o grades did i get ? could be six , could be one , but that 's not important . what 's important is that i am , right ? that i am .
spud , they 're my sheets .
i 'd really rather take care of it myself .
no problem for me either . honestly , it 's no problem .
it 's no problem .
there 's no need .
no , i 'll wash them . i 'll take them home and bring them back .
i 'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now .
sorry about last night -
morning , spud . sit down and have some breakfast .
no problem . no problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood .
thanks , mark .
well , sub us , then , mate . i 'm expecting a rent cheque .
no , i 'm clean .
have you got any gear on you ?
i 'm sorry , tommy .
that 's nice .
aye .
clear ?
aye .
you take the test ?
no . me neither .
no .
following the game at all ?
no .
are you getting out much ?
would not say no , would not say no .
another dab ?
a little too well , if anything , a little too well , that 's my only fear , compadre .
try this .
my problem is that i tend to clam up . i go dumb and i ca n't answer any questions at all . nerves on the big occasion , like a footballer .
it 's a tightrope , spud , a fucking tightrope .
nightmare .
exactly .
and you might get the fucking job .
but try too hard --
right .
if they think you 're not trying , you 're in trouble . first hint of that , they 'll be on to the dss , 'this cunt 's no trying ' and your giro is fucking finished , right ?
yeah .
now remember --
cheers .
good luck , spud .
sorry , boys , i do n't have two thousand pounds .
come on , mark , every cunt knows you 've been saving up down in london .
that 's tough .
we 're two thousand short .
but you do n't have the money ?
four grand .
what was your price ?
so we 've just come from tommy 's funeral and you 're telling me about a skag deal ?
so he met me and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price , with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy i know in london .
so ?
about four kilos . so he tells me . got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week , where he met two russian sailors . they 're fucking carrying the stuff . for sale there and then , like . so he wakes up the next morning , realizes what he 's done and get very fucking nervous . wants rid of this . { -- -- -- -- -- he 's looking for swanney to punt it , but swanney 's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg . -- -- -- -- -- }
how much ?
there 's a mate of swanney 's . mikey forrester -- you know the guy . he 's come into some gear . a lot of gear .
what ?
it was just an idea .
why would i want to sell my passport ?
well , this guy i 've met runs a hotel . brother . loads of contacts . does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners . get you a good price .
why ?
well , christ , if i 'd known you were going to get so humpty about it , i would n't have bothered . are you going to eat that ?
it was my fucking television .
i got a good price for it . rents , i need the money .
i ca n't believe you did that .
and i 'll tell you why . because i 'm fed up to my back teeth with losers , no-hopers , draftpacks , schemies , junkies and the like . i 'm getting on with life . what are you doing ?
fuck you .
i know a couple of addicts . stupid wee lassies . i feed them what they need . a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull . it 's easy money for me . not exactly a fortune , but i 'm thinking , 'i should be coining it here . ' less whores , more skag . swanney 's right . get clean , get into dealing , that 's where the future lies . set up some contacts , get a good load of skag , punt it , profit . what do you think ?
you 're all hear .
fuck you . ok , so tommy 's got the virus . bad news , big deal . the gig goes on , or had n't you noticed ? swanney fucks his leg up . well , tough shit , but it could have been worse .
you 're a real mate . and what about tommy ? have you been to see him yet ?
do n't know . maybe thursday .
when are you going to visit him ?
cut it out .
and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth , jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off .
god , you 're sick .
he made me lick it .
oh no , do n't even mention it .
no , he did n't make me touch it .
you know .
what ?
did he -- you know ?
it was n't that bad .
eughh . sounds horrible .
i 'm cooking ' up . there is a silence .
say something , mark , say something --
it was n't my baby . she was n't my baby . baby dawn . she was n't mine . spud 's ? swanney 's ? sick boy 's ? i do n't know . maybe allison knew . maybe not . i wished i could think of something to say , something sympathetic , something human .
oh , fuck . sick boy reaches out to allison .
what 's wrong , allison ?
i think allison had been screaming all day , but it had n't really registered before . she might have been screaming for a week for all i knew . it 's been days since i 've heard anyone speak , though surely someone must have said something in all that time , surely to fuck someone must have .
clear enough , moneypenny . this should present no significant problem .
do you see the beast ? have you got it in you sights ?
give me the gun .
yeah , beautifully fucking illustrated .
that 's your theory ?
yeah .
right . so we all get old and then we ca n't hack it any more . is that it ?
that means fuck all . the sympathy vote .
despite the academy award ?
i do n't rate that at all .
what about the untouchables ?
all i 'm trying to do is help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory .
ok , ok , so what 's the point you 're trying to make ?
charlie nicholas , david niven , malcolm mclaren , elvis presley . -
so who else ?
no , it 's not bad , but it 's not great either , is it ? and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right , it 's actually just shite .
some of his solo stuff 's not bad .
well , at one time , you 've got it , and then you lose it , and it 's gone for ever . all walks of life : george best , for example , had it and lost it , or david bowie , or lou reed -
what do you mean ?
it 's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life .
roald dahl . fuck me .
roald dahl .
who wrote it ?
tomorrow afternoon . usual set-up .
the park ?
and i wondered if you 'd care to go to the park tomorrow .
you do n't know , do you ?
but you 're looking better , it has to be said . healthier . radiant even .
who wrote it ?
you can look it up .
ok , so who was it , then ?
fuck off ! he never wrote any of them .
eh - ian fleming ?
screenwriter ?
lewis gilbert .
director ?
one hundred and sixteen minutes .
running time ?
nineteen-sixty-seven .
you only live twice ?
the only drawback , or at least the principal drawback , is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
i would say , in those days , he was a muscular actor , in every sense , with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster , but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead , closer in that respect to cary grant .
people think it 's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite , which is not to be ignored , but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it . otherwise we would n't do it . after all , we 're not fucking stupid . at least , we 're not that fucking stupid . take the best orgasm you ever had , multiply it by a thousand and you 're still nowhere near it . when you 're on junk you have only one worry : scoring . when you 're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite . got no money : ca n't get pished . got money : drinking too much . ca n't get a bird : no chance of a ride . got a bird : too much hassle . you have to worry about bills , about food , about some football team that never fucking wins , about human relationships and all the things that really do n't matter when you 've got a sincere and truthful junk habit .
goldfinger 's better than dr. no . both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office , in which field , of course , thunderball was a notable success .
i chose not to choose life : i chose something else . and the reasons ? there are no reasons . who need reasons when you 've got heroin ?
sure will , pal , sure will .
you 'll have to send us a postcard .
yeah .
sounds great , swanney .
the strategy is this : get clean , get mobile , get into dealing , and this time next year i 'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon .
sure .
and see when i get out of here . i 've got plans . going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand , where women really know how to treat a guy . see , out there you can live like a king if you 've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket . no fucking problem .
great .
as you wish .
no , thank you . i 'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs , please .
in that case --
regret to inform , sir , that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago .
stick it on my tab .
and would sir care to settle his bill in advance ?
why , thank you .
your usual table , sir ?
excellent .
your favourite dish .
what 's on the menu this evening ?
to see you through the night that lies ahead .
no , i do n't think so .
you 'll need one more hit .
that 's hardly a substitute .
he knows a lot about sean connery .
he 's always been lacking in moral fibre .
yeah , well , it surely worked for him .
the sick boy method .
sure , sure . i 've heard it before .
i 'm going to get it right this time . going to get it set up and get off it for good .
well , it 's up to you .
yeah . no more . i 'm finished with that shite .
are you serious ?
from time to time , even i have uttered the magic words .
does n't it make you proud to be scottish ?
look , tommy , we know you 're getting a hard time off lizzy , but there 's no need to take it out on us .
it 's fresh air .
it 's really nice , tommy . can we go home now ?
it 's the great outdoors .
are you serious ?
there .
such as sitting in a darkened room , watching videos , drinking , smoking dope and wanking . does that answer your question ?
such as ?
if i 'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket , i 'm just saying it had better be good . there 's plenty of other things i could be doing .
it will be . it 'll make a change for three miserable junkies who do n't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack .
this had better be good .
i do n't know , tommy . i do n't know if it 's ... normal .
well , what are you waiting for ?
but where ?
a walk .
what ?
we go for a walk .
well , i 've paid for the ticket .
so what 's it going to be ?
big time . absolutely fucking radge . 'it 's me or iggy pop , time to decide . '
went ballistic ?
yes , but then she finds out i 've bought a ticket for iggy pop the same night .
that 's fair enough .
useless motherfucker , that 's what she called me . i told her , i 'm sorry , but theses things happen . let 's put it behind us .
i 've got balls like watermelons , i 'm telling you .
six weeks and no sex ?
she read it in cosmopolitan .
where did she come up with that ?
it 's a nightmare . she told me she did n't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in .
six weeks !
six weeks .
how long is it ?
no joy yet .
how 's it going with gail ?
no . well , yes . i have to admit it : i 'm a perfectionist . for me , it 's the best or nothing at all . if things go badly , i ca n't be bothered , but i have a good feeling about this interview . seems to me like it 's gone pretty well . we 've touched on a lot of subjects , a lot of things to think about , for all of us .
mr. murphy , { leaving your friend aside , } do you see yourself as having any weaknesses ?
no , not homeless people . beggars , francis begbie -- one of my mates . i would n't say my best mate , i mean , sometimes the boy goes over the score , like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he 's fucking gubbed me in the face , right --
homeless people ?
i love people . all people . even people that no one else loves , i think they 're ok , you know . like beggars .
what do you see as your main strengths ?
it runs deep . share it with me .
my pain ?
i could n't help but notice you pain .
bring it closer so that i might join with it . do it , or watch these puny things die horribly .
the ship ... .
bring me the ship or i will destroy you !
no , no , it 's not possible .
he doubts me .
why ? why have you done this to my friend ?
you doubt me ?
he has his doubts ...
it will be your chariot !
then i shall make use of this starship .
it could . yes .
this starship , could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier ?
with a starship !
and how did you breach the barrier ?
we sought only your infinite wisdom .
magnificent . you are the first to find me .
it was not . the barrier stood between us - but we breached it .
it is i. the journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one .
qual se tu ?
do n't worry , fellas . your secret's` safe with me . i 'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up .
sulu ! look ! the sun 's come out ! it 's a miracle !
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees .
is there a problem , gentlemen ?
do n't tell them you 're lost . you 'll never live it down .
return to prearranged coordinates for pickup .
rescued at last .
bad news , gentlemen . shore leave 's been cancelled .
but , captain , we 're firing directly on your position .
in firing position . torpedo armed .
estimating destination in 6.7 hours , present speed .
following new course . warp seven .
pavel .
new course ? you have no authority . what 's going on here ?
plotting our new course .
sulu , what are you doing ?
and we ca n't see a thing . request you direct us to the coordinates .
um ... yes . we 've been caught in a blizzard !
all right , we 're lost . but we 're making good time .
admit it . we 're lost .
i do n't have a clue .
what 's emergency landing plan b ?
do it . go to red alert .
but the shuttle-
raise shields .
mr. chekov , i 've lost the bird of prey . she must have cloaked .
closing .
position , bird of prey ?
shuttle en route .
do you realize what you 've done ? it was n't bloodshed i wanted .
i instruct you to surrender . you are under attack by federation forces .
what 's going on ?
we will be happy to beam down . but first we must have certain assurances .
then it 's fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me . in the meantime , captain chekov , i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates .
you are a master of understatement . they are likely to destroy the planet .
your threats amuse me , captain chekov . what consequences did you have in mind ?
this is captain pavel chekov speaking . you are in violation of neutral zone treaty . i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences .
a federation starship .
this is the starship enterprise .
understood . kirk out .
no , but you can bet they will .
have the klingons responded ?
your orders are to proceed to nimbus iii , assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible . above all , however , get those hostages back safely .
oh , please .
other ships , yes . but no experienced commanders . captain , i need jim kirk .
with all due respect , the enterprise is a disaster . there must be other ships in the quadrant .
the klingon , the romulan , the federation consuls . now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs ...
the same . from what we can make out , a terrorist force has captured the only settlement . and they 've taken hostages .
on `` the planet of galactic peace ? ''
i apologize for canceling shore leave , but look , we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii .
you caught me on my way to the shower .
jim ... ? well , we 're dressing informally , are n't we ?
bob ?
enterprise , this is starfleet operations . come in .
can we have it quiet ?
have faith , my friend . there are more of us than you know .
but how ?
perhaps i have a way to bring one here .
a starship ? there are no starships on nimbus iii .
what you seek . what all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge . but to find it we 'll need a starship .
what is it you seek ?
join my quest .
i feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart . how can i repay you for this miracle ?
the power was within you .
where did you get this power ?
let us explore it together .
what do you know of my pain ?
your pain runs deep .
it 's all i have .
besides , i ca n't believe you 'd kill me for a field of empty holes .
beam up spock and dr. mccoy . now !
she 's got partial power , sir . i might be able to take two of you .
mr. scott , you 're amazing .
head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right . then left at the blowscreen . you ca n't miss it .
mr. scott , get the transporter working . if we contact a rescue ship we 'll need it . which way to the turbo shaft ?
if we could send a distress signal ...
captain , we ca n't trust anyone now .
then we 'll have to get them out the old fashioned way .
scotty here , captain . transporter is still inoperative . even if we could lock onto the hostages , we could n't beam them up .
i hope it wo n't come to that , mr. scott .
do n't you worry , captain . we 'll beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push .
aye , captain how many times do i have to tell you ? the right tool for the right job ...
very well , mr. scott . carry on .
i think you gave me too much time , captain .
you told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks . i gave you three . what happened ?
go , sulu .
bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two .
transporter room . status .
paradise city , can you boost your power ? we 're barely receiving transmission .
respond with static . let them think we 're having difficulty . which would n't be far from the truth .
captain , we 're receiving transmission from paradise city . they 're demanding to know our intentions .
standard orbit , mr. sulu .
put it on the screen .
captain , we 're receiving the hostage information you requested .
put it on the veiwscreen , would you please ?
captain , starfleet transmission on line .
er ... you forgot to take it with you .
why did n't you beep my communicator ?
mr. scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft . the transporter beam is non-operational . captain , we 've received important orders from starlet command .
yes . i lost a brother once . i was lucky . i got him back .
i was thinking of sybok . i 've lost a brother .
maybe he 's not out there , bones . maybe he 's right here ... in the human heart spock ?
not possible . you were never alone .
spock , i thought i was going to die .
welcome aboard , captain .
spock ?
i believe we are witnessing my birth .
what is this ?
it 's all right , captain . proceed .
spock ... do n't .
mark two . request emergency assistance . acknowledge .
... mark two .
to anyone within the sound of my voice : this is captain james t. kirk of the federation starship enterprise . if you read me , acknowledge . acknowledge .
the emergency channel , open .
spock .
fire the rockets !
if i activate them now , captain , we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate .
spock ... the booster rockets .
it must be all those marsh melons .
it would appear we are too heavy .
uh-uh .
hmmm ?
i believe i have found a faster way .
the only problem is , it 's up there . we 're down here .
there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room .
`` c. '' ... `` k . ''
new word . `` b '' .. `` a '' ... um ...
`` a '' ... `` n '' ... uh , `` d '' ... end of word .
a `` t . ''
you 're right . i 'm a little out of practice . uh ... .that 's an `` s . ''
that 's a little vague , spock -
i am here , captain .
spock ! my only concern is getting the ship back . when that 's done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until you 're green in the face . until then , you 're either with me or you 're not .
sybok possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known .
but the center of the galaxy ca n't be reached . no ship has ever gone into the great barrier . no probe has ever returned .
there sha ka ree is fabled to exist .
that he 's found it . sha ka ree . the reason sybok left vulcan .
is what possible ?
is it possible ?
he did have pointed ears .
this , er , person ... did n't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble , did he ?
the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find . he failed to escape .
how do you know ?
this is a new brig , captain . it is escape-proof .
there 's got to be a way out of this place .
he 's sorry , see , he 's sorry . everything ... that makes everything all right . he 's sorry , everything 's ...
i was not disposed to discuss ... matters of a personal nature . for that , i 'm sorry .
why did n't you tell me this before ?
exactly . that is correct . sybok 's mother was a vulcan princess . upon her death , sybok and i were raised as brothers .
i got ta sit down .
i have a half brother .
there , you see ? see ?
technically , you are correct . i do not have a brother .
you did too . sybok could n't possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you do n't have a brother .
i did not .
you mean he 's your brother brother ? you made that up !
no , no , no , captain . you do not understand . sybok also in a son of sarek .
look , the man may be a fellow vulcan , but that does n't ...
you ordered me to kill my brother .
i ordered you to defend this ship .
if i had pulled the trigger , sybok would be dead .
you stay out of this ! why , spock ? why ? i.. all you had to do was pull the trigger .
if you think it would help .
forgive you ? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass !
worse . i have betrayed you . i do not expect you to forgive me .
what you have done is betray every man on this ship .
captain , what have i done -
damnit , spock . god damnit !
let me do something .
you must allow us to act .
an eternity during which we 'll be vulnerable to klingon attack . korrd-you tell him .
exactly 15.5 seconds .
yes , captain .
be one with the horse .
yes , captain ?
spock .
we do n't have 1.2 hours .
at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 1.2 hours .
mr. sulu . execute .
to land any closer would risk detection .
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city .
their equipment is primitive but effective . i recommend we land at coordinate 8563 .
damn . let 's go .
klingon vessel now entering quadrant . bird of prey . estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear .
fascinating .
when he encouraged others to follow him , he was banished from vulcan , never to return .
he believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion , not logic .
why ?
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors .
the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief .
what do you mean ?
there was a young student , exceptionally gifted , possessing of great intelligence . it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan . but he was a revolutionary .
who is it he reminds you of ?
i do not often think of the past .
he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth .
but he does seem familiar ?
i can not be certain .
spock , what is it ? do you know this vulcan ?
perhaps i have , captain . perhaps i have .
what is it ? you look like you 've seen a ghost .
general korrd 's military strategies were required learning when i was a cadet at the academy . when they put me out to pasture , i hope i fare better than korrd .
the same . he 's apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command .
not general korrd .
yes .
i could use a shower .
goodnight , doctor .
goodnight , spock .
goodnight , bones .
yes , captain .
go to sleep , spock .
life is not a dream .
yes , spock ?
jim .
spock , we 're on leave . you can call me jim .
captain ?
i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words .
come on , spock . why did n't you jump in ?
the lyrics are - are very simple . it 's , er , `` row , row , row your boat , gently down the stream . merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily , life is but a dream.. '' the doctor and i will start it off , and then when we give you the signal , you jump in . doctor , if you please .
that song did not come up in my research , captain .
`` row , row , row your boat ... '' i love `` row ... '' do - do you know `` row , row , row , row , row your boat ? ''
are we leaving , captain ?
`` pack up your troubles . ''
that 's great . i have n't sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa . what are we going to sing ? what ... bones , what are we going to sing ?
oh . i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong .
i am preparing to toast a marsh melon .
what are you doing ?
i 've always known ... i 'll die alone .
i do n't understand .
oh , no . it is n't that . i knew i would n't die because the two of you were with me .
perhaps `` because it is there '' is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain .
oh , god
spock , i appreciate your concern , but if you do n't stop distracting me , i 'm liable to be one ...
concentration is vital . you must be one with the rock .
i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods .
on the contrary . gravity is foremost on my mind . look , i 'm trying to make an ascent here . why do n't you go pester dr mccoy for a while ?
i do not think you realize the gravity of your situation .
mm . ?
ah , captain ?
because it 's there .
and that is ?
i 'm not trying to break any records . i 'm doing this because i enjoy it . not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain ...
i regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing el captain is in no danger of being broken .
i 'm flattered . twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me .
spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods ?
spock ...
kirk to enterprise . listen carefully ...
what have i done ?
because you , too , must know .
what makes you think i wo n't turn us around ?
no conditions .
no special conditions ?
the ship needs its captain .
about the ship ...
am i ? we 'll see .
you are mad !
given to me by god . he waits for us on the other side .
your vision ?
but if we do , will that convince you that my vision was true ?
wait ! you know we 'll never make it through the great barrier .
no . i refuse .
now learn something about yourself .
no ... i did n't .
i 've done nothing . this is who they are . did n't you know that ?
spock ... what have you done to my friends ?
i do n't control minds . i free them .
the only realty i see is that i 'm a prisoner on my own ship . what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew ?
sha ka ree . `` the scource . '' `` heaven . '' `` eden . '' call it `` qui'tu . '' to the romulans , it 's `` vorta vor . '' the andorian word is.. unpronounceable . still , every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang . for us , that place will soon be a reality .
i 'm afraid of nothing .
what you fear is the unknown . the people of your planet once believed their world was flat . columbus proved it was round . they said the sound barrier could never be broken . it was broken . they said warp speed could not be achieved . the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear . it 's an extension of personal fear . captain kirk , i so much want your understanding . i want your respect . are you afraid to hear me out ?
you ca n't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier .
i trust your message was received ?
i 'll take you to the bridge .
we must change our course at once .
in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible , we 're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually .
what are you doing ?
sybok , listen to me . in order for this craft to enter the landing bay , enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam . to get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
no ! no reply . remain on course .
but i thought captain chekov.. i see . very clever , captain . spock , it would appear that you 've been given a second chance to join me . what do you say ?
james t. kirk , captain of the enterprise .
who are you ?
you staged all this to get your hands on my ship ?
i must have your starship .

















maybe you could wait until i 'm a wee bit stronger i do n't think i could take it in my present condition . or yours .
no , no , no . scotty - scotty ... there 's so much i want to tell you .
no . sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we 've always been afraid to express .
he 's not ?
scotty , dear , he ' not a madman .
uhura , i had the strangest dream . i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise .
easy , easy , easy , scotty . easy . you 're back with us .
starfleet , are you aware of our currant status ?
they ca n't be serious . the ship 's in pieces and we 've less than a skeleton aboard .
i had a feeling you would say something like that . so i brought us dinner .
oh , i can not leave her now when she needs me the most .
and i thought we were supposed to be going together .
uhura , i thought you were on leave .
i know you 'll whip her into shape , scotty . you always do .
`` let 's see what she 's got , '' said the captain . and then we found out , did n't we ?
borgus frat .
no . you must save yourselves . forgive me , brother . forgive me .
sybok , we must find a way ...
this is my doing . this is my arrogance ... my vanity ...
sybok .
i do n't understand.. reveal yourself to me !
sybok - this is not the god of sha ka ree - or any other god !
sybok , you are my brother , but you do not know me . i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago . since that time i have found myself and my place . i know who i am . and i can not go with you .
i do n't understand ...
i belong here .
why not ?
i can not go with you .
spock ?
do you ?
i know you better than that .
i hide no pain .
each man 's pain is unique .
you know i 'm right .
no . i will not .
put him in the brig with captain kirk . spock , you will accompany me to the bridge ?
no . you must kill me .
sybok , you must surrender .
of course . of course . then i 'll take the ship without your help .
i am a starfleet officer .
i 'm sorry , spock . i ca n't surrender now . i 'm not through violating neutral zone treaty . in fact , i 'm just getting started . and now for my next violation i intend to steal something . something very big .
it was not my intention to amuse you . these are serious charges . however , if you surrender now-
spock , you 've developed a sense of humor after all .
nah ... i decided ... i 've had enough of video games to last me a good long time . i feel like gettin ' into some real life ...
should n't you wait till your lawsuit 's settled ?
oh , that is beautiful . you 've got the goods ...
and dillinger 's instructions to divert them -- it 's all there - look , even his home phone number , when he logged on .
your old files -- ?
i know , i met him .
flynn ! i made it . i worked out some new codes for tron , put 'em on a disk , and -- it 's running .
uh ... got any cinnamon ?
want one ?
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health .
my dinner .
hi , flynn .
hi , alan .
boy , if we were inside , i know how to forge us a group 6 access ...
not if my tron program was running . that would seal the system off . if your file 's in there ...
yeah . tryin ' to find the file and erase it . once that 's gone , ai n't nothin ' can stop him . just eddie and his master control program , runnin ' things from on high..
dillinger ?
because somewhere ... in one of those memories ... is the evidence . if i got in far enough , i could reconstruct it .
i still do n't get why you 're trying to break into the system .
oh my . meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i 'm not seeing one dime .
senior exec .
yepper . and vice squad , and meltdown ... whole slew of 'em . i was this close to starting my own little enterprise . but : enter ed dillinger . another software engineer -- not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky . one night , our boy flynn goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file , and ... nothing . a big blank . we now take you to three months later . ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has `` invented '' -- the slime did n't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion . thus begins his meteoric rise to ... what is he now , executive v.p . ?
you invented space paranoids ?
sherman , set the wayback machine for ... oh , 1973. kevin flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom . he 's so bright that he starts going in there at night , and sets up a private memory file , and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing , called ... ... space paranoids .
you have n't told him ?
i do n't get it .
`` embezzling '' is such an ugly word , mister bailey ... no , actually i 'm trying to get a legal brief together .
are you embezzling ?
tried to . ca n't quite make the connection with that sucker , though . if i had a direct terminal ...
you did break in .
i 'm certainly not .
i do n't think i 'm cleared for this .
uh , no ... i mean , not that often -
flynn !
what -- ?
for being on to dillinger .
for what ?
that dillinger 's on to him .
of what ?
to warn him .
what for ?
i mean i want both of us to go .
you call that getting over it ?
i want to go to his place .
okay , okay ...
oh , i wish you 'd forget about that . it was all so long ago . i 've totally gotten over it .
flynn had access to you , too . i 'm not interested in talking about him .
flynn had group 7 access .
something about tampering . some body 's prob'ly trying to siphon the r & d budget into his checking account , i do n't know . why are you so interested ?
did he say why ?
yeah ... pain in the neck , you know , i was all set
did you say group 7 access ?
frustrating . i had tron almost ready to run , and dillinger cut everybody with group 7 access out of the system .
how 's it going upstairs ?
yes , wo n't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking , and people will stop . lora , i 'm going to stay and run some data through . see you tomorrow .
they 'll start to soon enough .
well , you have to expect some static . computers are just machines after all , they ca n't think ...
ever since he got that master control program set up , system 's got more bugs than a bait store .
yes ... but you have to go roundtrip , and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance . hah !
great . can it send me to hawaii ?
not disintegrating , alan -- digitizing . while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object , the computer maps out a holographic model of it . the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam . then the computer reads the model back out , the molecules go back into place , and ... voila .
boy , i sit up there grindin ' away all day , and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun .
hello , alan .
beautiful !
ok
ah . sounds good . well , we should have you running again in a couple of days , i hope .
no , it 'll run independently . it can watchdog the mcp as well .
mmm . part of the master control program ?
it 's called tron . it 's a security program itself , actually . monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems ... if it finds anything going on that 's not scheduled , it shuts it down . i sent you a memo on it .
no , no , i 'm sure , but -- you understand . it should only be a couple of days . what 's the thing you 're working on ?
i hope you do n't think it 's me . i do n't even balance my checkbook on downtime . i 've got a honeywell at home for that .
we have to close that down , just briefly . security reasons . someone with that access has been tampering .
yeah ... ?
oh , you have group 7 access , do n't you ?
well , i do n't know ... i just tried to run this program i 've been working on , and i was denied access all of a sudden . i thought maybe i 'd been laid off and nobody told me .
oh , yes . the algorithms on cloud seeding ... great piece of work . how 's it going ?
alan . alan bailey .
come on in ...
let 's get outta here .
yes !
so ... nice ship you got here . what 's our next move ?
you said it .
not a chance .
this town 's full o ' live ones .
no , nuh-uh , never in a million years !
this honey does n't handle so good in town ...
yes , okay , exactement !
way to go ! we 're haulin ' !
another mouth to feed ... you do n't by any chance know how to drive this crate ?
right on the money !
i 'm your program ?
no ...
where 's your program ? wo n't it miss you ?
for sure ...
only yes and no ... you 're a bit .
oui , da , yessiree , sure 'nuff , you betcha .
oh . anything else ?
no , nyet , negatory , not on your tintype , no way .
that all you can say ?
yesssss . yes . yes . yes .
what do you mean , `` 'yes '' ?
so do as i tell you . keep that tron program out of the system . and get me those chinese language program i asked for .
you would n't dare .
you would n't want me to dig up flynn 's file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times , would you ?
if you think -
the same thing i want with the kremlin . i 'm bored with corporations . with the information i can access , i can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human .
what do you want with the pentagon ?
i 've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then .
now , wait a minute -- i wrote you .
it should n't be any harder than general motors was . but now ... this is what i get for using humans .
the pentagon ?
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week ...
it 's my fault . i programmed you to want so much ...
i ca n't afford to have an independent program monitoring me . do you have any idea how many outside systems i 've gone into ? how many programs i 've appropriated ?
i 'm sorry -
ed , i am so very disappointed in you .
end of line .
cute .
there 's a 68.71 percent chance you 're right .
i think we 'd better shut off all access till we can find that file . just to be safe .
i 'm afraid so . i spotted him this time and kicked him out , but he 's getting trickier all the time .
meanwhile , he might find it .
i would if i could find it . it 's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range . meanwhile ...
he 's still looking for that old file ... ca n't you just appropriate it ?
yes . it felt like flynn .
flynn ?
it 's our friend the boy detective . he 's nosing around again .
no problem , master-c. if you 've seen one consumer electronics show ... what 's up ?
thank you , no . i have some work to do ... assuming i can still log on .
i 'm sorry , walt . so much pressure lately ... you feel like going for a drink ?
that was uncalled-for .
it can be arranged ...
oh , i know all that . sometimes i wish i was back in that garage ...
doing our business is what computers are for . look , walter , with all respect -- icom is n't the business you started in your garage anymore --
user requests are what computers are for .
the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do . i ca n't sit and worry about every little user request that --
that mcp , you know , that 's half the problem right --
walter , i sympathize , but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy --
ed , all i 'm saying is - if our own people ca n't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is , when you 're working on a piece of research -
they may be ... de-rezzed ... on the carrier ... hurry ...
dumont ! where 's yori ? where 's flynn ?
no ... tron ... must ... destroy mcp ... first ...
dumont !
all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible .
alan-one . he calls me ... may i pass ?
who is your user , program ?
when you 've been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises ... many reassurances ... many brave plans ...
really . you 'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no mcp looking over your shoulder .
hah .
dumont ... my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again .
oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they 'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i do n't think you
well i want to communicate --
hmm . a difficult proposition ... difficult proposition at best . perhaps you 've noticed ... we 're not exactly packing them in these days ...
i ... have come to communicate with my user .
yes ?
aah , i 'm fine ... little hung over is all ...
how about you ?
hey ... you guys ok ?
yes .
did we make it ?
not with this disk . i 'm going to check on the beam connection , yori . you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs .
not us , i hope .
probably decided not to pursue us , the sea of simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions ... rough navigating . programs have a way of just ... disappearing here .
what about our friend - sark ?
all right . thank god . alan stayed awake , at least .
we 're on our way . alan-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
stranger and stranger ...
i hate to disappoint you , pal , most-the time , that 's how it is for users , too .
well -- that 's how it is for programs , yes , but --
look , you guys know how it is . you just keep doin ' what it looks like you 're supposed to , even if it seems crazy , and you hope to hell your user knows what 's goin ' on .
then ...
you wish . man , i have n't had a second to think since i got down here . i mean in here . out here . whatever .
but -- if you 're a user -- then everything you 've done has been part of a plan ...
it 's time i levelled with you , tron . i 'm a -- well , i 'm what you guys call a user .
wrote the ... ?
no big deal . i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine ... i mean , i did write the program for it .
i 'm sorry , tron ... he 's ... he did n't make it .
flynn ... where 's ram ?
yeah , i ... oops !
you 're alive !
greetings , program ...
flynn ! !
no good ... they might block off the old chip . this way .
how about over there ... that empty memory ?
tanks ... coming back . let 's go .
what 's that ?
you know anybody that 's got an army for rent , that 's fine ... but my , uh , user said to go take that sucker out . an ' let 's face it , the big ox is n't gon na get any weaker . i feel like hittin ' him now , while i 'm good an ' mad . some nerve ... what does he care whether you guys get killed , long as he keeps rakin ' in quarters ?
what , just the three of us ?
i , uh ... i 'm a program from a user that ... knows alan ... ?
the name of my user , yeah . but how ... ?
well , is n't it -- ?
where did you hear that name ?
alan !
shhhhh .
flynn ... you ca n't ... i
probably .
but ... wo n't you be de-rezzed ?
jump .
why ? what are you going to do ?
yori , steer us over the beam , right next to it .
let 's get some power here .
flynn , we 've got to help him !
almost ... i just have to adjust our course at the next junction . i 'd better go check the instruments ...
elementary physics ... a beam of energy can always be diverted ... ooh , my head are we there yet , mommy ?
how did you do that , flynn ?
it 's too far !
there 's another beam !
lousy utility companies ... they 're the same wherever you go .
the mcp blasted it ... there are very few domains left with any power at all .
what 's wrong with that area ?
a little ... over there , the mountains of data ... and i think that 's the silicon valley ...
boy the view from up here ... you know the territory ?
guess i took a wrong turn somewhere ...
a user -- in our world ?
little more juice 's all it needs ...
hey ... !
come here .
damn ! never fails ... minute the warranty runs out ...
are you kidding ? i think it 's stealing us -
we 're inside a recognizer ... you are crazy -- stealing a recognizer --
what 's goin ' on ?
alan-one ...
feel what ? you okay ?
it grows on you .
paramus ... wonder what those initials stand for ... ... probably program assist routine -- well , it sounds like a lovely place .
well ... my home `` sector '' was called paramus ...
the tower , yes -- flynn , have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you 're from ?
it 's all circuits ... must be an input/output component ...
recognizers !
watch it !
yeah , but i 'm remembering all kinds of stuff . like ... my user wants me to go after the mcp
he was disoriented in transport , tron .
tron ... ?
flynn ! look , tron , he survived !
sure , a little disorientation . that 's normal , when they transport you . it 'll come back to you . you 're doing real well in training . remarkable , really ...
oh , uh ... i do n't remember too much ...
how 'bout yourself ?
yeah , yeah -- that 's great .
oh , i was an actuarial program ... worked at a big insurance company . it really gives you a great feeling , helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course , if you look at the payments as an annuity , over the years , the cost is really
hey , ram ... what were you ... you know , before ?
well , great , that 's no sweat -- i play video games better than anybody .
you 're a ... '' guest '' of the master control program . they 're going to make you play video games .
look ... just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about , okay ? where am i ?
you 'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt , do n't worry about that .
you 're getting out of the business ?
hey , you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games ... cheap ?
are you kidding ? you guys 'll he running this joint by then ...
well , just do n't forget your old friends when you 're rich and famous .
you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for ?
as long as we stay off the top floor , dillinger 'll never know we 've been in here ...
swell ... i 'll log us both on , and you can get your tron thing running ...
okay ... flynn , i 'm gon na put you at my terminal , down in the laser lab . we 'll be up in alan 's office .
not much chance of that now . the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it ...
do n't even say that . you 've got to find that file before he does..
boy , i bet i know who 's workin ' late tonight .
i 'm afraid it 's a little late for that . dillinger 's shut off group 7 access . he must know what you 're up to .
touche , honey . yeah , i 've been doing a little hacking here . which i 've got every reason , as you well know ...
you can see why all his friends are fourteen years old .
whew . you never were much for small talk . she still leave her clothes all over the floor ?
have you been sneaking into the icom system ?
so ... how 's the world of serious science ?
good luck . you ca n't even think in here .
we have to talk .
hey ! good to see you guys ! nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple .
i do n't have time , sark . and neither do you . end of line .
we 'll get them , sir ... these things take time .
yes , and now you 've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation .
now , sir ... we did take care of that user you sent us --
i hope you 've enjoyed being a command program , sark . i wonder how you 'll like working in a pocket calculator ... maybe one of those watches that plays `` happy birthday '' to its user once a year .
end of line .
yes ... acknowledge , master control ...
then pull yourself together . get this clown trained . i want him in the games until he dies playing .
wait ... i need that ...
you rather take your chances with me ? want me to slow down your power cycles for you ?
but-what if i ca n't ... ?
now get this straight , pal -- no one user wrote me . i 'm worth a couple million of their man-years ! i 'm bigger than all those little wimps put together ! humans they ca n't even keen their social order in one piece
well , i -- it 's just -- i do n't know , a user , i mean ... users wrote us . a user even wrote you ...
that 's right . he pushed me ... in the other world . somebody pushes me , i push back . so i brought him down here ... what 's the matter , sark ? you look nervous .
a user ?
he 's not any kind of program , sark . he 's a user .
you 've got it . i 've been hopin ' you 'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he ?
i 've got a little challenge for you , sark -- a new recruit . he 's a tough case , but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games ... let him hope for a while ... and blow him away .
yes , mcp .
strategic air command .
sure , i 'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me . which branch of the service ?
we might be capturing some military programs soon ... that interest you ?
thank . you , master control .
i have to find out what alan wants ... that comes first .
do you know what he 's talking about ?
we have to .
you think we can make it there ?
do it !
what do you think ?
they 'd better be ... i do n't want to bust outta this dump an ' find nothin ' but a lot of cold circuits waitin ' for me .
the users ... you really think they 're still there ?
another free program off line . what 's his user s'posed to do -- ?
new guy ...
where 's flynn ?
it 's something users do .
nice ...
i ca n't . there 's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds !
we have to get off this beam !
power surge ... the transmission beam 's too strong !
what is it ?
then i owe you some thanks ...
this is flynn ... the one who busted me out .
as long as it gets us out of here
yes ... it can take us across the sea of simulation ... all the way out of the game grid ... to the mcp .
i had to ... in the games ...
you 've grown , big program .
it 's a flat . but wait a micro ...
why is everything ... like this ?
my quarters .
do n't know yet ... i have to get in touch with alan . he was going to tell me how to
how ?
that 's all going to change , yori ...
i ca n't believe how bad it 's gotten around here since the mcp started taking over ... all the good functions have shut down ... everybody looks so dead ... i 'm afraid to even go out during down-time ...
oh , tron ... i knew you 'd escape ... they 've never built circuit that could hold you ...
yori ... hey ...
will you shutup . i should never have told you about him .
just an hour ? you should tell this stud to take more time .
can you cover me for an hour ?
simon ? ohmygod .
helen ! it 's your mystery man .
then you better do something to * jumpstart that man 's motor . you know ... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion .
harry only has two moods : busy ... * and asleep .
girlfriend , you got a man . you * just have to take control . . . set up the right mood . *
you bitch .
yeah . you know harry .
i 'm shocked .
are you kidding ? harry had to go out of town .
so i guess you did n't get away * for the weekend after all ? *
i mean , it 's not like he 's saving the world or anything . he 's a sales rep for chrissakes . whenever i ca n't get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day . six seconds and i 'm out . but he acts like he 's curing cancer or something .
i have a book report .
where are you off to young lady ?
i 'm done .
out .
where are you going ?
dinner 's in the warmer . tell your father i may be late .
it is true ! he does n't know anything about me . he still thinks i 'm like ten years old or something . as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything 's fine . but it 's not fine . nothing 's fine .
that 's not true , honey --
mom , wake up ! dad barely knows we exist .
no you 're not . you 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake !
out . if dad does n't care enough about us to be here on his birthday , then why should i care ? i 'm going to a movie .
where are you going ?
dad . you just think you know everything , do n't you ?
i seem to remember something about a history project that 's due tomorrow .
unbelievable ! trent told me he wrote it . he 's history .
honey that song came out in 1968 , when i was exactly your age .
dad , how come you know the words ?
why ? so i can wind up like you ? what 's the point ?
you 're going to stay in school . do you understand ?
yeah , right .
there are going to be some changes dana . you 're going to start following some rules . and i 'm going to be there to see that you do .
fine .
how was school today ?
i 'm not a pumpkin ! okay ? ! ! do i look even remotely like a pumpkin ? ! i 'm not a muffin , or a cupcake or a honeybear either ! and you do n't understand anything dad ...
you 'd tell me if there was something wrong , would n't you , pumpkin ?
okay , dad .
you know you can always talk to me . right ? whatever is going on in your life , your mom and i 'll understand .
yeah , dad .
dana , are you listening to me ?
i 'm not sure what to believe anymore , young lady . you never used to lie to me . but lately you do n't seem to know the difference between right and wrong .
great ! you 're going to believe that fat dweeb mr. hardy over your own daughter .
you seem fine now .
he lies ! i was there ! i was in the nurse 's office , cause i had a headache .
dana , mr. hardy called . why were n't you in class today ?
roger , one . rolling .
immediate roll . acquire subject at k street and key bridge . * vehicle is red-and-white * convertible . you have six minutes .
okay . let 's step up the surveillance on her . put on two more guys .
and the second you left there , we started getting calls to the * ghost numbers . they were checking out the renquist front .
she lives in rome , but she does stuff here the smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections , so she has offices * here . *
you 're kidding .
uh huh . right here in river city .
alright , i want a complete workup on her . do we know where she is ?
and this is a little above market- * rate for the horizontal bop , even * for a total biscuit like her .
this is impressive , gentlemen . of course , it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was .
probably because it sounds scary . *
why ?
they call him `` the sand spider '' . *
sorry , sir . uh ... here 's what we got .
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you ? !
yes .
faisil . you 're new on harry 's team , are n't you ?
sorry .
he 's got it .
if i break it they can take it out of my pay .
i 'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these .
it 's show time . do n't look at * the flash . do not look at the flash .
any minute now .
here they come .
... well get the highway patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers . just the basics ... get away from windows , do n't look at it ... yeah --
get 'em . i 'll brief them on the way in .
i can get 3 marine corps harriers here in about 12 minutes . they 're on maneuvers out of boca chica .
... the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius . anybody that ca n't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on , immediately --
-- you tell the son of bitch this is bright boy alert . repeat , a bright boy alert . and i need a patch of the white house asap . that 's right --
you 're welcome .
let 's go . i 'll brief you in the air .
i thought this look like your work .
why not ? you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary ? is jean-claude done yet ? *
you 've reached a new low with this one . i ca n't believe you 're crazy enough to use the room at the marquis .
in her walkman . it 's the one thing i knew she 'd be taking .
we 're dead , right ? so ... where 'd you put the transmitter ?
i 'm giving her an assignment . i am offerring you a choice . if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life . if not , you will go to federal prison , and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone . your like will be destroyed .
oh shit . harry ... what 're you doing ?
there is only one solution to your problem , mrs. tasker . you must work for us .
now what ?
wait ! calm down , mrs. tasker . there is only one more question .
she could be telling the truth .
you did n't have sexual relations with him ?
she 's lying .
you know about that ?
what about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job ?
whatya talking ? i 'm clean as a preacher 's sheets , babe . clean as a --
you tell on me , i tell on you .
goddamnit , harry . this is our butts . so your life is in the toilet . so your wife is banging a used car salesman . sure it 's humiliating . but be a man here --
the purse is still at the house .
she 's still at my house . *
give me the goddamn page ! !
aw , it 's got ta be a typo --
it skips from page nine to eleven . where 's page ten ?
what are you talking about ?
give me the page .
he could be working her to get to you .
yeah , but for who ? *
guy 's a spook !
sure , harry . i 'm on it .
yeah , and we do it twenty times a day . do n't give me that crap . just put on the taps . now .
helen 's phone . her office line and the line at my house .
what 're you talking about ? we have that .
put a tap on her phone .
is this national security stuff boring you ?
relax . helen still loves you . she just wants this guy to bang her . it 's nothing serious . you 'll get used to it after a --
i still do n't believe it .
same thing happened to me with wife two . i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty . i mean empty . she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge . what kind of person would think of that ?
it ca n't be .
nobody believes it can happen to them .
it ca n't be . not helen .
congratulations . welcome to the club .
she 's having an affair .
something to do with helen , is what i 'm getting .
he -- helen . helen -- it 's helen . it 's helen , gib .
i 'll just hang then , shall i ?
just hang a minute .
you want me to just hang -- ?
look , uh ... i 've got to talk to helen about this thing with dana . i 'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch .
hardcore , highly fanatical , ultra- * fundamentalist . linked to * numerous car-bombings , that cafe * bomb in rome , and the 727 out of lisbon last year . major player . *
abu kaleem malik .
can we go to the office now , mr. superspy ?
son of a bitch !
ha ! the little prick ditched you ! that is so goddamn funny .
that 's it . get 'im harry we 'll teach that little puke not to signal .
so , you wan na play huh ? you little --
goddammit ! that 's outrageous .
look at the way the little punk is driving . he 's all over the place . look -- he has n't signalled once .
okay . here she comes .
hey , did that guy harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet ? cause apparently that 's the only way we 're going to catch the son of a bitch --
and make it fast . my horse is getting tired .
copy that .
stay on him .
there 's another guy , still in the car .
gon na try to get a closer shot of * beavis & butthead . *
what 's the plan ?
see , that 's the problem with terrorists . they 're really inconsiderate when it comes to people 's schedules .
helen 's going to be pissed .
uh huh . want me to lose them ?
station wagon ?
yeah , right .
what ? it 's on the way . she says she 's got something for me .
she could be moving money , guns . anything .
she 's importing stuff from all over the mid-east .
hi , i 'm harry renquist . i own a --
it 's all set up ... ghost phones and fax , all the usual stuff . you have a suite at the marquis hotel under renquist . okay , reality check . go .
nope . the art buys are in a separate ledger .
it does n't mean anything . she buys antiquities for khaled .
in her dreams .
you better watch it . she might file on you for sexual harassment .
albert gibson . three four nine nine one .
harry tasker . one zero zero two four .
well . . . i moved back in . my lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement . do n't change the subject ... you owe me two hundred bucks .
i thought you moved out .
twenty here , fifty there ... i figured my wife 's boyfriend was taking it .
will you just open the door ! *
okay . okay . de-nail ai n't just a river in egypt . she 's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion .
no way . not dana .
uh huh . and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm . i * say even money that physicist on * the bike is boinkin ' her . *
right . she 's only fourteen .
fourteen , harry .
do n't be ridiculous . she 's only -- how old is she ?
see , kids now are ten years ahead * of where we were at the same age . you probably think she 's still a virgin --
yeah , but you 're not her parents , anymore , you and helen . her parents are axl rose and madonna . the five minutes you spend a day with her ca n't compete with that kind of constant bombardment . you 're outgunned , amigo .
she knows not to steal . i 've taught her better than that .
kids . ten seconds of joy . thirty years of misery .
what ?
son of a bitch !
here , check these out .
thanks dear .
yep . sleep fast .
what a team . see you at eight .
got it . nice touch . okay , pick me up at eight . the de-brief is at ten hundred .
for dana , schmuck . bring your kid something . you know . the dad thing .
what 's this for ?
what ?
harry ? harry ? !
in the helicopter .
harry ! where are you !
it 's talkradio . you 're on the air .
switching to sub-vocal . gib , you copy ?
you 're not going anywhere .
look , if you ask me everything twice , this is going to take a really long time . and i have to get home to my family .
but he 's not exactly ringing your bell lately , right ? i mean --
my husband is a good man .
i was n't cheating !
so , it was your first time .
no ! never !
is this a common thing for you ? cheating ?
i do n't know . i guess ... i wanted to see what would happen .
but you did n't . why not ?
i should have gone to the police , i suppose .
yes , sir .
god ! you have no idea how much that turns me on . i 've never had the courage to say this before but ... i love you , janice .
yes sir .
and you still reach for your piece every time .
ten , mr. gibson .
janice , how many years have you been buzzing us in ?
sure . say that now .
there is no us , you psychotic bitch .
did you tell her about us , harry ?
you 're damaged goods , lady .
you think i care about their * cause ? or yours ? not at all . * see , america is on top now . . * . but so was rome , once . all * civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and ... living * well takes money . *
not exactly .
oral hygiene ?
this is samir . see if you can guess his specialty .
juno . i wish i could say it 's a pleasure to see you again .
hello , harry .
uh , yes , it is important .
yes what ?
yes .
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
i 've always been a collector at heart . when i see something i want , i have to have it .
is that why you got into this business ?
especially in this light . this is the only light they had then , * so i like to study it this way . i love this place . i love all ruins .
it 's certainly ... dramatic .
do you like my tomb ? the museum * financing fell out , so i thought * your clients might be interested .
those wimps . it 's because i use * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike . i told you to move those crates an hour ago . come on guys , let 's get going .
let 's see ... that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words . and that other dealers and archeologists do n't like you much .
that 's right . they want something ... dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you 're the one to see .
so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters ?
i agree .
well , what 's the point of waiting ?
i 'd like that .
call me , if you 'd like to see some of my other pieces .
i adore it .
very good . it 's sixth century b.c . do you like the period ?
this is persian , if i 'm not mistaken .
dance ?
not yet . but we 'll find him .
i told the guy -- - i told the guy , this is n't even my order .
... you should have seen your father , standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce . he looked like such a dope .
wait here . if you have to use this , use it . do n't choke . okay ?
oh shit .
go down there and kill everybody , i guess .
what are you going to do ?
we must be in the florida keys . * . . the overseas highway * connects the islands to the mainland .
if we 're on an island , why are they using trucks ?
no . much more .
as much as you used to ?
yes .
do you still love me ?
what ?
tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again .
harry ... snap out of it !
god , you have great legs .
what is it ?
looks that way .
are you a total lying , scumsucking pig harry ?
no . but i wanted to .
did you pork her harry ?
she 's really a fox , is n't she ?
what about juno ?
i do n't take those assignments .
my god . have you had to ... have sex with other women in the line of duty ?
17 years .
yup . *
are we going to die ?
ask me a question i would normally lie to .
is it working yet ?
yes .
it makes you tell the truth ?
sodium amytal , maybe some other truth agent .
what did he give you ?
do n't call me honey ! you do n't ever get to call me honey again . you understand ? ! you pig !
i 'm sorry , honey .
oh yeah ? oh yeah ? then where did i get this ?
i do n't know what this crazy bitch is on . you should just cut her loose , so we can get down to business .
harry , what 's the matter with you ? tell them the truth . we 're married , we have a daughter --
you would n't believe me .
what were you doing there ?
harry , be quiet . let me handle this .
let the hooker go . she 's not important .
he 's got nothing to do with this . it 's me you want , right ?
i 'm not wearing any .
now slide the nylons off one by one .
sure , hon .
allison is sick in bed . i have to go over there , honey .
what ? oh , the flat tire ? yeah , i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there .
so last night was pretty exciting , huh ?
no . doris .
natasha ?
the code name of your contact will be boris . your code name will be --
i can do it !
think carefully . you will be lying to the man you love . the person who trusts you the most .
i think so .
no one must know ! especially him . you must appear to live your life normally , conveying nothing . the security of this nation depends on it . can you do that ?
my husband ca n't know about this .
you will be contacted with the assignment .
what do you think ? of course yes ! what 's involved ?
yes or no .
oh , gee thanks . mmmm , let me see --
i love him . i have always loved him and i will always love him . can i go home , please ?
louder please .
yes .
do you still love your husband ?
what ?
answer the question --
let me out of her ! right now !
no .
this simon . did you sleep with him ?
i needed to feel alive . i wanted to do something ... outrageous . and ... i do n't know ... it felt good to be needed . to be trusted . to be special .
what did you need ?
i do n't know . i guess i needed something ...
why ?
yes .
and you agreed ?
he wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .
let me handle this part . do you mind ? why did you go to carlos ' hideout ?
you 're in a lot of trouble , mrs. tasker , so i suggest you cooperate . if we want to know the most intimate details of your life , you 'd better tell us .
that 's none of your goddamn business ! what kind of questions are these ?
yeah . i suppose he is .
would you say he was boring , then ?
harry ? what can i say about harry ? he 's a sales rep for a computer company .
tell me about your husband , mrs tasker .
well , maybe a little .
you were n't attracted to him at all ?
no .
not because you were attracted to him ?
he needed my help .
why did you continue to see him ?
three days later , he called me . he told me to meet him at overlook park .
what did happen ?
i do n't know anything about a faction . i just met simon ... or whatever his name is ... a couple of weeks ago . i barely know him .
how long have you been a member of his faction ?
i ca n't , honey . i promised allison i 'd go shopping with her . sorry .
i thought we might have lunch tomorrow .
oh , sure . fine . i 'll get some more gravy .
so , a little excitement in an otherwise dull day . did is work out okay ?
yeah . it was a rush thing . they needed some documents down at the court house . i barely made it .
they said you had to run out .
they must 've just missed me .
i was in the area , and i thought you might like to have lunch .
my husband the hero .
uh huh .
it sounds wild . so now you 're a big hero , right ? for fixing their system .
... and i 'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone ... talking to a translator , right , who 's getting half of it wrong ... it was unbelievable ... really wild .
well i pull out the manual on their setup , which is the new 680 server ...
what 'd you do , honey ?
it 's the big client in japan , and it 's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed ... this guy 's having a meltdown --
i could n't believe it . i go back to get this report i need , right , and the phone is ringing , so like a bonehead i answer it --
i 'll just be a second . so what happened tonight at the office ?
come on to bed , you do n't have to brush your teeth .
yeah . it was great .
i 'm sorry . thank you for the party .
it 's okay , do n't bother , harry .
look , i know you 're upset . i 'm really sorry , honey . i raced home as quick --
baby , i said i 'd be there . really . trust me . got ta go , honey . bye bye .
sorry to bother you in a meeting , but you have to promise me that * you 'll be home at eight . i don't * want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year . you promise ?
hi honey . what 's going on ? *
i 'll handle it .
i need you to talk to dana . the vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon .
good thinking , honey .
i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks .
what did you tell him ?
it 's not okay . it 's extortion .
uh huh . okay .
yeah , it was wild .
that 's fabulous harry .
yeah . you should have seen it . we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system , the one for the 680 ... how you can write up an order and the second the customer 's name goes into the computer , it starts checking their credit , and if they 've ordered anything in the past , and if they get a discount ...
how 'd it go at the trade show ? you make all the other salesmen jealous ?
me too .
i 'm late .
okay .
fine , honey . stay asleep .
hi , honey . how was the flight ?
no . soon as i turn you 'll shoot me .
beat it .
wait ! you got the wrong guy . my name 's simon . look , just let me go . there 's no need to kill me . i have n't seen your --
you son of a bitch . did you really think you could elude us forever , carlos ?
yeeaoowww ! !
let me think about it . hold it a day for me ?
see . you and this car were meant for each other . why fight it ? sure , i have a couple other buyers lined up , but i like your style . whattya say ? should we start on the paperwork ?
hey , slow down you 're gon na miss the turn !
sooooo ... she 's pretty good in bed , then ?
red hot . her thighs steam .
but with you , she gets to be hot , right ?
some kinda legal secretary of something . married to some boring jerk .
what does she do ?
i always have a couple on the hook . you know . there 's one right now , i 've got her panting like a dog . it 's great .
you working on someone right now ?
those idiots .
dickless . if they took care of * business , i 'd be out of business , know what i mean ?
what about the husbands ?
exactly . the trick is , you got ta pick your target . they have to be nice little housewife types . school-teachers . but , i 'm telling you , you get their pilot lit , these babes , they can suck- start a leaf-blower .
use 'em and lose 'em .
does n't matter . i like change . you know , constant turnover . as soon as i close the deal , it 's one of two more times , then adios .
is n't that hard to keep up , in the long run ?
well , think of it as playing a role . it 's fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
so you 're basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i could n't do it .
okay , just ask yourself . what do women really want ? you take these bored housewives , married to the same guy for years . stuck in a rut . they need some release . the promise of adventure . a hint of danger . i create that for them .
sure . set me up and then do n't tell me .
sorry . trade secret .
so what 's your angle ?
it 's killer . look at me -- i 'm not that much to look at . no really . i can be honest . but i got 'em lining up , and not just skanks , either . some are .
and you 've got one .
let 's face it , harry , the vette gets 'em wet . but it 's not enough . if you want to really close escrow , you got ta have an angle .
absolutely .
what 're we talking about here ? pussy , right ?
go ahead .
boris and doris ?
uh ... well , okay then . you sound terrible . i 'll run out right now . just call the prescription in to the pharmacy . sure , no problem . bye .
get going !
what ?
he said he was an american agent .
of course . mrs. tasker . and what were you going with the international terrorist , carlos the jackal ? taking dictation ?
kettleman , barnes and mcgrath . i 'm a legal secretary .
i said sit down . who do you work for ?
fuck you .
like one ?
hold that thought .
something you obviously have a hard time doing !
now just keep your knees together , and you 'll be fine .
samir is just going to ask harry a few questions . see , we 're not even sure which agency harry works for . now , samir is absolutely first class , but on the other hand we have harry , here , who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years . so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist .
what 's going on , harry ?
no , you do n't understand , we 've been married for 15 years --
no , my dear , he is a federal agent . he killed two of my colleagues the other night .
look , harry 's not part of this . he 's just a sales rep .
so now it 's tasker ? not renquist ?
i 'm helen tasker . harry 's my husband . and you are ?
who 's your little friend ?
i just glances inside .
you can call me simon . you 're very brave to do this ... you opened it .
helen .
thank you . you saved my life . what 's your name ?
relax . there , that 's better . let yourself slip into the role .
it 's just that ... it 's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that , i --
you see what i mean ? that reaction would give us away in a second . try to relax .
here . sit down . be comfortable .
i do n't know . i have to think ...
helen , there 's a double agent in my outfit ... i do n't know who . there 's no one i can trust . except you . can you get away ? just for two days .
we 're going to paris ?
just for the operation in paris . i need to be married . they 'll be looking for a man traveling alone .
i 'm married !
helen , i want you to be my wife .
what is it you need me to do ?
to our assignment .
it 's serious . that 's all i can * say . just meet on k street under * the key bridge . at eight sharp . *
what 's happened ?
yes . now go .
you 'll call me then ?
not here . i 'll call you and we 'll rendezvous again . we have to leave separately , so we are n't seen together . for your safety .
what is it you want me to do ?
something came over me , i just had nail him , no matter what the * risk . it was pretty hairy . i thought he had me , a couple of * times . but i really ca n't take credit . . .
and you chased one ?
three of them . hardly worth * talking about . two wo n't bother * me again .
were they trying to kill you ? *
it 's strange . i knew i was in a woman 's thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins .
right , of course . i was worried when i did n't hear from you that night .
i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
you can trust me completely .
i 'm sorry , i ca n't .
tell me what happened ?
you recognized my style . see , you 're very good . you 're a natural at this .
that was you ? !
sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation . see -- two men killed in a restroom , and two unidentified men in a running * shootout , ending at the * marriot ...
yes .
did you read the papers yesterday ?
cairo was a day at the beach next * to this .
worse than cairo ? *
ssshhh ! we say op . covert * operation . and this one got a little rough .
where were you ? on a ... uh , * mission ?
it 's my job to risk my life , but not yours . i feel bad about bringing you into this , but you 're the only one i can trust .
i understand .
okay . it 's just , things are a bit hot for me right now . if i get a signal ... i may have to leave suddenly .
i kept looking back , like you taught me . i did n't see anyone .
are you sure you were n't followed ?
the same place . one o'clock . i have to go now . see you tomorrow . remember , i need you .
yes . i suppose so . where ?
yes . go ahead .
helen ? it 's simon . is it safe to talk ?
hello ?
his wife ? good . bring them .
his wife .
who is this woman ?
use the gifts that allah has given you .
how ?
find out who this renquist it .
what do you want me to do ?
no . he checked out okay --
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --
it 's a good thing you pay me well .
yeah . i got elbowed right in the eye . and if that was n't enough , i got hurled the ball when i 'm not looking . wam ! right in my face .
you got that playing basketball ?
this is great , we got cable .
holy mary , mother of god .
you ca n't have just one .
that was so good i am gon na have another .
knock wood .
you 're gon na be on `` t.j. hooker '' ?
he wants to speak with you .
let me speak to clarence .
nope .
not yet .
yes .
yeah , my room-mate leaves it on the tv .
gotten your mail yet ?
what letter ?
what letter ?
did you get the letter ?
wait a minute -
he said do n't go nowhere . we 'll be there some time tomorrow .
i ca n't wait to meet you . clarence told me all about you . he said you were his best friend . so , i guess that makes you my best friend , too .
hello , alabama .
hi , dick . i 'm alabama worley .
that rhymes .
it 's been fun thinking about the money but i can walk away from it , honey .
it is what i want . but i do n't want to spend the next ten years in jail . i do n't want you guys to go to jail . we do n't know what could be waiting for us up there . it 'll probably be just what it 's supposed to be . the only thing that 's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars . i 'm just looking at the downside .
i thought it was what you wanted , clarence .
but in my movie , baby , you get the top billing .
it 's got a nice ring to it . it sounds like a movie . `` clarence and alabama go to cancoon '' . do n't 'cha think ?
why cancoon ?
cancoon .
i been in america all my life . i 'm due for a change . i wan na see what tv in other countries is like . besides , it 's more dramatic . where should we fly off to , my little turtledove ?
you ai n't kiddin ' , we got lives to start over , we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch .
but knowin ' me and you gon na be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook . i love airports now . me 'n ' you can get on any one of those planes out there , and go anywhere we ant .
leavin ' detroit . goin ' off on vacations , startin ' new lives , business trips . fun , fun , fun , fun .
what ?
i used to live by one back in dearborn . it 's real frustratin ' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ai n't got shit . i hated where i was , but i could n't do anythin ' about it . i did n't have enough money . it was tough enough just tryin ' to pay my rent every month , an ' here i was livin ' next to an airport . whenever i went outside , i saw fuckin ' planes take off drownin ' out my show . all day long i 'm seein ' , hearin ' people doin ' what i wanted to do most , but could n't .
how come ?
with a vengeance , i hated them .
really ?
ya know , i used to fuckin ' hate airports .
i 'm gon na hop in the tub and get all wet , and slippery , and soapy . then i 'm gon na lie in the waterbed , not even both to dry off , and watch x-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin ' arms .
you were chillin ' , kind of creepy even . you totally fucked with his head . i 'm gon na go grab dinner .
i felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles .
babalouey , you were perfect , i could hardly keep from busting up .
you did it , quickdraw . i 'm so proud of you . you were like a ninja . did i do my part ok ?
nope . i 'm not really a wine gal .
do you want some wine , sweetheart ?
... was so romantic .
what ?
i think what you did ...
what ?
i think what you did was ...
no joke . this is probably the best hamburger i 've ever had . i 'm serious , i 've never had a hamburger taste this good .
is this a joke ?
yeah . but to be honest , i put myself in that position . when i drove up there i said to myself , `` if i can kill 'em and get away with it , i 'll do it . '' i could . so i did .
was it him or you ?
you do n't know me . not when it comes to shit like this . i have to do this . i need for you to know you can count on me to protect you . now write down the address .
you do n't know him -
look , sweetheart , he scares you . but i 'm not scared of that motherfucker . he ca n't touch you now . you 're completely out of his reach . he poses absolutely no threat to us . so , if he does n't matter , which he does n't , it would be stupid to lose your things , now would n't it ?
no , clarence . just forget it , babe . i just wan na disappear from there .
so i can go over there and pick up your things .
why ?
write down drexl 's address .
what ?
sweetheart , write down your former address .
i just got ta get somethin ' .
where you goin ' , honey ?
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ...
no no no no no no no no no ...
of course . are there others , mr. worley ?
oh , you 're speaking of my charming wife mrs. alabama worley .
bottom of the ninth . mr. worley . oh , by the by , mr. worley , have you seen your lovely wife today ?
top o ' the morning , mrs. worley .
how do you do , mr. worley ?
hello , mrs. worley .
thank you .
i do .
well , that 's the one that explains how jimmy wang yu became the incredible one-armed boxer .
i do n't believe so .
did ya ever see `` the chinese professionals '' ?
you better not be fuckin ' teasin ' me .
you better not be fucking teasing me .
you will ?
yes .
will you be my wife ?
what ?
thank you . i wan na see you again too . and again , and again , and again . bama , i know we have n't known each other long , but my parents went together all throughout high school , and they still got a divorce . so , fuck it , you wan na marry me ?
at the bus station . he said i 'd be a perfect call girl . and that he knew an agency in california that , on his recommendation , would handle me . they have a very exclusive clientele : movie stars , big businessmen , total white-collar . and all the girls in the agency get a grand a night . at least five hundred . they drive porsches , live in condos , have stockbrokers , carry beepers , you know , like nancy allen in `` dressed to kill '' . and when i was ready he 'd call 'em , give me a plane ticket , and send me on my way . he says he makes a nice finder 's fee for finding them hot prospects . but no one 's gon na pay a grand a night for a girl who does n't know whether to shit or wind her watch . so what i 'm doin ' for drexl now is just sorta learnin ' the ropes . it seemed like a lotta fun , but i do n't really like it much , till last night . you were only my third trick , but you did n't feel like a trick . since it was a secret , i just pretended i was on a date . an , um , i guess i want a second date .
goddamn it , alabama , you got ta get the fuck outta there ! how much longer before he 's slappin ' you around ? punchin ' you in the stomach ? how the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place ?
this motherfucker sounds charming !
slapped her around a little . punched her in the stomch . it was pretty scary .
what did he do to arlene ?
well , i would n't go so far as to call him nice , but he 's treated me pretty decent . but i 've only been there about four days . he got a little rough with arlene the other day .
is he nice ?
he thinks he is . he says his mother was apache , but i suspect he 's lying .
is he black ?
uh-huh .
a real live pimp ?
uh-huh .
you have a pimp ?
my pimp .
who and what is a drexl ?
it 's over on the tv . all it says is : `` dear clarence . '' i could n't write anymore . i did n't not want to ever see you again . in fact , it 's stupid not to ever see you again . las night ... i do n't know ... i felt ... i had n't had that much fun since girl scouts . so i just said , `` alabama , come clean , let him know what 's what , and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to drexl and fuck yourself . ''
that dazzling imagination .
i do n't know . i did n't talk with them . the plan was for me to bump into you , pick you up , spend the night , and skip out after you fell asleep . i was gon na write you a note and say that this was my last day in america . that i was leaving on a plane this morning up to ukraine to marry a rich millionaire , and thank you for making my last day in america my best day .
who ?
yeah , that one . somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you .
`` heroes for sale '' ?
i 'm a call girl . there 's a difference , ya know . i do n't know . maybe there 's not . that place you took me to last night , that comic book place .
you 're a whore ?
i 'm not a theater checker . i 'm a call girl .
what are you , a theater checker ? you check up on the box office girls . make sure they 're not rippin ' the place off .
clarence , i 've got something to tell you . i did n't just happen to be at the theater . i was paid to be there .
did you hurt yourself ? whatd'ya do ? step on a thumbtack ?
you did n't do nothing .
what 's wrong , sweetheart ? did i do something ? what did i do ?
uh-huh .
so he really loved her ?
that 's what happened . in fact , when she died , it was considered to be the happiest time of her life . she 'd been fucked over so much by men she did n't trust them . she was havin ' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him . now , other people had asked to marry her before , but she could n't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money . so , she said no . and the guy says , `` look , i really love you , and i wan na prove it . so have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens , i can never get any of your money , and i 'll sign it . '' so she did , and he asked her , and she said yes . and once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew : he was a millionaire .
you mean she got a bad batch ?
yeah , she od 'd . but was n't on her last legs or anythin ' . she did n't take too much . it should n't have killed her . there was somethin ' wrong with what she took .
she od 'd , did n't she ?
you know , a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died .
i love janis .
you 're not stupid . just wrong .
i dunno . i guess i 'm just stupid .
what would make you think that ?
uh-huh , i was tryin ' to think of somethin ' to say to you , then i thought , she does n't want me bothering her .
at the movies ?
you know when you sat behind me ?
i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up .
oh , you look so cute as little elvis .
five .
oooooh , you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit . how old were you then ?
he was just born , remember ? this is the first one . you know that guy , dr. gene scott ? he said that the story of spiderman is the story of christ , just disguised . well , i thought about that even before i heard him say it . hold on , let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time .
god , spiderman looks different .
that 's a `` rookies '' doll . george sanford brown . we got ta lotta dolls . they 're real cool . did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in `` the black hole '' ? i always found it funny somewhere there 's a kid playin ' with a little figure of earnest borgnine .
what 's that ?
well , we sell other things too . cool stuff . `` man from u.n.c.l.e . '' lunch boxes . `` green hornet '' board games . shit like that . but comic books are main business . there 's a lot of collectors around here .
i did n't even know they had stores that just sold comic books .
four hundred bucks .
you bet . how much is that worth ?
that 's where trouble comes into paradise . but the boss let 's you borrow some money if you need it . wan na see what `` spiderman '' number one looks like ?
do you get paid a lot ?
i 'm hip . but you know , i 'm comfortable here . it 's easy work . i know what i 'm doing . everybody who works here is my buddy . i 'm friendly with most of the customers . i just hang around and talk about comic books all day .
that 's a long time .
almost four years .
how long have you worked here ?
yeah , i got the key , so i come here at night , hang out , read comic books , play music .
wow . what a swell place to work .
because you looked like a nice guy , and i was a little scared . and i sure couldda used a nice guy about that time , so i spilled my popcorn on you .
and in a theater full of empty seats , why did you sit by me ?
apparently , i was hit on the head with something really heavy , giving me a form of amnesia . when i came to , i did n't know who i was , where i was , or where i came from . luckily , i had my driver 's license or i would n't even know my name . i hoped it would tell me where i lived but it had a tallahassee address on it , and i stopped somebody on the street and they told me i was in detroit . so that was no help . but i did have some money on me , so i hopped in a cab until i saw somethin ' that looked familiar . for some reason , and do n't ask me why , that theater looked familiar . so i told him to stop and i got out .
what 's the story behind you takin ' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone ?
i 'm not sure yet . ask me again later .
do you have a fella ?
i 'm sure there must be something , but i do n't really remember . the only thing that comes to mind are persians .
turn-offs ?
mickey rourke , somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life , like elvis 's voice , good kung fu , and a tasty piece of pie .
what are your turn-ons ?
phil spector . girl group stuff . you know , like `` he 's a rebel '' .
what kinda music do you like ?
very much . now , where were we ?
like it ?
yes , i would .
would you like a bite of my pie ?
burt reynolds .
what 's your favorite movie star ?
i do n't remember . but off the top of my head , i 'd say black .
what 's your favorite color ?
might be from tallahassee . but i 'm not sure yet .
where are you from .
i do n't remember .
what do you do ?
ask me them again . one by one .
well , for starters , what do you do ? where 're ya from ? what 's your favorite color ? who 's your favorite movie star ? what kinda music do you like ? what are your turn-ons and turn-offs ? do you have a fella ? what 's the story behind you takin ' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone ? and , in a theater full of empty seats , why did you sit by me ?
what do you want to know ?
c'mon . what 're ya tryin ' to be ? the phantom lady ?
there 's nothing to tell .
tell me about yourself .
how 'bout me what ?
well , enough about the king . how about you ?
i 'd love some pie .
would you like to get some pie ?
i love to get pie after a movie .
well , it 's just when i see a really good movie i really like to go out and get some pie , and talk about it . it 's sort of tradition . do you like to eat pie after you 've seen a good movie ?
no . not particularly . how come ?
i suppose you got ta get up early , huh ?
'bout twelve .
what time is it ?
nothing . it 's just you 're a girl after my own heart .
sure . why not ?
you took a cab to see three kung fu movies ?
i took a cab .
where 's your car ? i 'll walk you to it .
that 's my real name , really . i got proof . see .
is that your real name ? really ?
alabama whitman . pleased to meet ya .
my name is clarence , and what is yours ?
if that was the r , i 'd love to see the x .
you shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the `` streetfighter '' . it was the only movie up to that time rated x for violence . but we just saw the r .
sonny kicks ass .
does sonny kick ass or does sonny kick ass ?
great movie . action-packed !
he ai n't so much good guy as he 's just a bad motherfucker . sonny do n't be bullshittin ' . he fucks dudes up for life . hold on , a fight scene 's coming up .
i thought sonny was the good guy .
thanks a lot .
want some goobers ?
the oriental in black . he 's an assasin . now , at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had . so he got himself arrested . they take him into the police station . and he starts kickin ' all the cops ' asses . now , while keepin ' them at bay , he finds the guy he was supposed to kill . does a number on him . kicks the cops ' asses some more . kicks the bars out of the window . and jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him .
the oriental .
not at all . i , this guy here , he 's sonny chiba .
what a wonderful philosophy . thanks for being such a sweetheart . you could have been a real dick .
it 's ok. do n't worry about it . accidents happen .
i 'm the clumsiest person in the world .
yeah . i 'm fine . it did n't hurt .
oh , look what happened . oh god , i 'm so sorry . are you ok ?
and here we are .
... when my mom went into labor , my dad panicked . he never had a kid before , and crashed the car . now , picture this : their car 's demolished , crowd is starting to gather , my mom is yelling , going into contractions , and my dad , who was losing it before , is now completely screaming yellow zonkers . then , out of nowhere , as if from thin air , this big giant bus appears , and the bus-driver says , `` get her in here. '' . he forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital . so , because he was such a nice guy , they wanted to name the baby after him , as a sign of gratitude . well , his name was waldo , and no matter how grateful they were , even if i'da been a boy , they would't call me waldo . so they asked waldo where he was from . and , so there you go .

clarence says we got ta be hittin ' it .

oh , hush up .
what kind of daughterly smackeroo was that ?
bye , daddy ! hope to see you again real soon .
it 's nine o'clock in the morning . nothing 's open .
how come ?
i did n't get any chicken .
thank god . i could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it .
the forager 's back .
okee-dokee , doggie-daddy .
this should cover it , auggie-doggie .
well , fuck that shit , we 'll get some real food . what would taste good . what do you think would taste good ?
i 'm pretty hungry . when i went to the store i was gon na get some ding-dongs .
in fact , i 'm gon na show you what i mean with a little demonstration . big d , toss me that shotgun .
i 'm hip .
nigger , back off , you ai n't beatin ' shit . now what would you do .
nigger , get real . you touch jayne kennedy she 'll have you ass in wayne county so fast -
me thinketh he doth protest too much .
damn skippy . he like it , too .
heard that .
shit ! nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass 'll do a lot a crazy ass things . so you wo n't eat pussy ? motherfucker , you be up there suckin ' niggers ' dicks .
i heard that .
shit , any nigger say he do n't eat pussy is lyin ' his ass off .
floyd say he do n't be eatin ' pussy .
what the fuck are you talkin ' about ?
take that shit somewhere else .
ai n't no man have to eat pussy !
you do n't like it , but you eat that shit . he eats it .
naw naw !
so you do eat pussy !
go on pussy-eaters ... laugh . you look like you be eatin ' pussy . you got pussy-eatin ' mugs . now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he 's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit .
nigger , i eat everything . i eat pussy . i eat the butt . i eat every motherfuckin ' thang .
hold on a second , big d. you sayin ' you eat pussy ?
that 's why it does n't come across as ass-kissin ' , because it 's genuine , and he can see that .
i 'm not lyin ' to him . i mean it . i loved `` coming home in a body bag '' .
you 're tellin ' him what he wants to hear , but that ai n't the same thing as kissin ' his ass .
you do n't think i 'm kissin ' his ass , do you ?
are you kiddin ' ? he loves you .
how do you think i 'm doin ' with lee ?
that was cool , was n't it ? you know , i do n't even know where that came from . i just opened my mouth and it came out . after i said it i thought , that 's a cool line , i got ta remember that .
oh , and your line to charles atlas in there : `` i 'll take that gun '' , `` you 'll have to '' .
can you develop an ulcer in two minutes ? being cool is hard on your body .
all anybody saw was clint eastwood drinkin ' coffee .
i was dying . i thought for sure everyone could see it on my face .
clarence , i got ta hand it to ya . you were cooler than cool .
killin ' 'em 's the hard part . gettin ' away with it 's the easy part . whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp 's killed ? burn the midnight oil tryin ' to find who done it ? they could n't give a flyin ' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin ' head . if you do n't get caught at the scene with the smokin ' gun in your hand , you got away with it .
if i thought i could get away with it -
i do n't blame you .
look , elvis , he is hauntin ' me . he does n't deserve to live . and i do want to kill him . but i do n't wan na go to jail for the rest of my life .
he do n't got no right to live .
you 'd really do that ?
i ai n't tellin ' ya nothin ' . i 'm just sayin ' what i 'd do .
i ca n't believe what you 're tellin ' me .
then shoot 'em . shoot 'em in the face . and feed that boy to the dogs .
yeah .
you wan na get unhaunted ?
yeah .
with that son-of-a-bitch walkin ' around breathin ' the same air as you ? and gettin ' away with it every day . are you haunted ?
live with what ?
can you live with it ?
what ?
fuck you ! my mother was apache .
wannabee nigger ...
no thanks ? what does that mean ? means you ate before you came down here ? all full . is that it ? naw , i do n't think so . i think you 're too scared to be eatin ' . now , see we 're sittin ' down here , ready to negotiate , and you 've already given up your shit . i 'm still a mystery to you . but i know exactly where your ass is comin ' from . see , if i asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down , i 'd say to myself , `` this motherfucker 's carryin ' on like he ai n't got a care in the world . who know ? maybe he do n't . maybe this fool 's such a bad motherfucker , he do n't got to worry about nothin ' , he just sit down , eat my chinese , watch my tv . '' see ? you ai n't even sat down yet . on that tv there , since you been in the room , is a woman with her titties hangin ' out , and you ai n't even bothered to look . you just been starin ' at me . now , i know i 'm pretty , but i ai n't as pretty as a couple of titties .
no thanks .
grab a seat there , boy . want some dinner ? grab yourself an egg roll . we got everything here from a diddle-eyed-joe to a damned-if-i-know .
well . that makes us practically related . bring your ass on in .
i 'm her husband .
who the fuck are you ?
she 's with me .
where the fuck is that bitch ?
no thanks , my stomach 's a little upset . i ate somethin ' at a restaurant that made me a little sick .
no . but thanks .
yeah , let 's just get outta here .
well , if we 're not gon na do it , let 's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here .
this is our last chance to play `` what if '' . i want to do it . i 'm just scared of getting caught .
now 's a helluva time to play `` what if '' .
no , i do n't really mean it . well , i mean , this is our last chance to think about it . how 'bout you , bama ?
do you really mean it ?
i know that richard . i do n't think i 'll need it . but something this last week has taught me , it 's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it .
look , dillinger , lee donowitz is not a pimp -
in case they try to kill us . i do n't know , what do you want me to say ?
in case of what ?
in case .
what the fuck did you bring that for .
um , nothing , let 's go ?
yeah ?
clarence .
ah , dick , let 's talk about it in the car . we ca n't be late .
they did n't even want a callback . they just hired me like that . me and peter breck are the two heavies . we start shooting monday . my call is for seven o'clock in the morning .
no shit ? dick , that 's great !
i got the part on `` t.j. hooker '' .
i 'm just makin ' sure we got everything . you got yours ?
yeah , well if we got lost , it 's your ass . come on , clarence , lets go . elliot 's going to meet us in the lobby .
let me handle this .
clarence ...
do n't expect me to be all broken up over poor drexl . i think he was a fuckin ' , freeloadin ' , parasitic scumbag , and he got exactly what he deserved . i got no pity for a mad dog like that . i think i should get a merit badge or somethin ' .
two guys . now you want me to help you with some big drug deal . fuck , clarence , you killed somebody and you 're blowin ' it off like it do n't mean shit .
two guys .
shut up ! first you come waltzing into my life after two years . you 're married . you killed a guy .
what 's to think about ?
would you just shut up a minute and let me think ?
the zoo . what are you waiting for ?
the zoo .
where ?
ok , call 'im up and arrange a meeting , so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff .
elliot blitzer .
elliot what ?
elliot .
what 's this acting class guy 's name ?
hardly anything . i was n't sure from your letter what was bullshit , and what was n't .
what'd'ya tell 'em ?
he 's nothing . he 's in my acting class . but he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named lee donowitz . i thought donowitz could be interested in a deal like this . he could use it . he could afford it .
is he big league ?
it 's difficult because you 're sellin ' it to a particular group . big shots . fat cats . guys who can use that kind of quantity . guys who can afford two hundred thousand . basically , guys i do n't know . you do n't know . and , more important , they do n't know you . i did talk with one guy who could possibly help you .
i 'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand . how difficult can that be ?
do you have any idea how difficult that 's gon na be ?
no way ! the whole enchilada in one shot .
yeah , they do . and maybe when i start being a successful actor i 'll know those guys . but most of the people i know are like me . they ai n't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of . now , if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
but you 're an actor . i hear these hollywood guys have it delivered to the set .
look , clarence , i 'm not joe cocaine .
drexl 's dead . this is clarence 's coke and clarence can do whatever he wants with it . and what clarence wants to do is sell it . then me and bama are gon na leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin ' . so , you got my letter , have you lined up any buyers ?
this is drexl 's coke ?
i do n't know ! a fuckin ' lot !
tell me .
do you have any idea how much fuckin ' coke you got ?
i know .
you 've got a helluva lotta coke there , man !
i certainly hope so .
it 's fuckin ' real ! it 's fuckin ' real !
it 'll get ya high .
this shit ca n't be real .
for the very first time in my life . do you know what that 's like ?
you 're really in love , are n't you ?
every word of it .
how much of that letter was on the up and up ?
you do n't meet him in the audition . that comes later . hope , hope .
did you meet captain kirk ?
... formica . i did real well . i think she liked me .
what 's so fuckin ' good about it ? actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world . it 's like they got ta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their sag card . oh , guess what ? i had a really good reading for `` t.j. hooker '' the other day .
good for you .
well , for the past couple of years i 've been goin ' out with girls from my acting class .
you goin ' out ?
just like in detroit , only skinnier .
well , she 's a pretty amazing girl . what are women like out here ?
that 's a pretty amazing story .
now tell him goodbye .
money problems ?
has he gotten his mail today ?
clarence sent a letter ?
ask him if he got the letter .
alabama , could you tell clar -
tell him we 'll be hittin ' his area some time tomorrow .
what ?
believe it or not , i actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me . i 'm not quite sure how i did it . i 'd hate to have to do it again . but i did it . wan na say hi to my better half ?
get the fuck outta here !
i 'm a married man .
get the fuck outta here !
well , there 's a story behind all that . i 'll tell you when i see you . by the way , i wo n't be alone . i 'm bringing my wife with me .
what 's up ? why 're leavin ' detroit ?
tomorrow .
you comin ' to l.a. ? when ?
well , you 're gon na be seein ' me shortly .
it 's great to hear from you .
you got it .
clarence ?
three kung fu movies .
you wan na take me to a kung fu movie ?
he is , bar none , the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever .
who 's sonny chiba ?
a donny chiba triple feature . `` the streetfighter '' , `` return of the streetfighter '' , and `` sister streetfighter '' .
what are we gon na see ?
how 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight ?
how 'bout me what ?
well , enough about the king , how 'bout you ?
i do n't blame you . so we 'd both fuck elvis . it 's nice to meet people with common interests , is n't it ?
when he was alive . i would n't fuck him now .
really ?
i 'd fuck elvis .
what 's waiting for us up there . tell me or i 'll pump two right in your face .
no . no you 're not .
apparently i 'm not as dumb as you thought i am .
you are the dumbest person in the world .
say it , goddamn it !
do n't lie to me , motherfucker . you apparently think i 'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world ! do n't you ? say : clarence , you are without a doubt , the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world . say it !
no .
do n't you ?
get on your knees .
yeah ?
elliot .
i guess so . follow me .
well , i guess it 's about that time .
they 'll be along .
where 's everybody else ?
no problems on both counts .
he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire . he wants everybody there . he 'll talk to you . if after talkin ' to you he 's convinced you 're ok , he 'll do business . if not , he 'll say fuck it and walk out the door . he also wants a sample bag .
mr. donowitz ? i told you , through dick . he 's in my acting class . about a year . yeah , he 's good . they grew up together . sure thing .
he wants to talk ya .
riddle me this , batman . if you 're all so much in love with each other , what the fuck are you doing here ? i 'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin ' up a panther 's ass . your guy 's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play joe fuckin ' hollywood till the wheels come off . he can sell it , he can snort it , he can play santa claus with it . at the price he 's payin ' , he 'll be everybody 's best friend . and , you know , that 's what we 're talkin ' about here . i 'm not puttin ' him down . hey , let him run wild . have a ball , it 's his money . but , do n't expect me to hang around forever waitin ' for you guys to grow some guts .
get it straight , lee is n't into taking risks . he deals with a couple of guys , and he 's been dealing with them for years . they 're reliable . they 're dependable . and , they 're safe .
then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me ?
no . no , you do n't .
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like french vanilla ice-cream ?
what ?
sure . i did n't hear anything .
we were in four h together . we 've known each other since childhood . so , i 'm handling the sales part . he 's my silent partner and he knows if i get fucked up , i wo n't drop dime on him . i did n't tell you nothin ' and you did n't hear nothin ' .
he trusts you ?
duh . what else would i be talking about ? now stop askin ' stupid doorknob questions . well , a year and a half ago , this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour . he snagged this coke . but , he 's a good cop with a wife and a kid , so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust .
the police department ?
what do you think , eightball ?
what department ?
no problem , elliot . i 'm just fuckin ' wit ya , that 's all . actually , i 'll tell you but you got ta keep it quiet . understand , if dick did n't assure me you 're good people i 'd just tell ya , none of your fuckin ' business . but , as a sign of good faith , here it goes : i got ta friend in the department .
look , dick , i do n't -
coco leaves . you see , they take the leaves and mash it down until it 's kind of a paste -
ha ha ha . no really , where does it come from ?
i grow it on my window-sill . the lights really great there and i 'm up high enough so you ca n't see it from the street .
unloading ? that 's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime .
- that you 're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
leave the gorillas .
yeah , ok .
want an animal cracker ?
so you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you 're unloading -
like , look at her . she looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down . elvis would n't fuck her with pat boone 's dick .
i can see what you mean .
it tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years . it covers the whole spectrum of fans , the people who love his music , the people who grew up with him , the artists he inspired - bob dylan , bruce springsteen , and the fanatics , like these guys . i do n't know about you , but they give me the creeps .
that good , huh ?
you know , i saw it on the stands , my first inclination was to buy it . but , i look at the price and say forget it , it 's just gon na be the same old shit . i ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later . man , i was ever wrong .
no . not yet .
have you read the story on elvis ?
yeah , i subscribe . it 's a pretty decent one .
actually , they can count it . i 'd like to use the little boy 's room .
wan na count your money ?
i bullshitted him .
if you do n't know shit , why does he think you can sell it ?
we grew up together .
why does he trust you ?
well , elliot was n't supposed to tell you anythin ' . thanks a lot , bigmouth . i knew you were a squid the moment i laid eyes on you . in my book , buddy , you 're a piece of shit . he 's not a dirty cop , he 's a good cop . he just saw his chance and he took it .
elliot tells me you 're fronting for a dirty cop .
bastards . that 's why i always eat at lawreys .
a norms in van nuys .
where 'd you go ?
i 'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up .
you like a little coffee with your cream and sugar ?
me too , boris .
do n't worry , i 'll desire . boris , could i have some more coffee .
now , that 's practically uncut . you could , if you so desire , cut it a helluva lot more .
like that merchant-ivory clap-trap . all those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books .
i hear you talkin ' clarence . we park our cars in the same garage .
you know , most movies that win a lot of oscars , i ca n't stand . `` sophie 's choice '' , `` ordinary people '' , `` kramer vs. kramer '' , `` gandhi '' . all that stuff is safe , geriatric , coffee-table dog shit .
thank you very much , clarence .
ok , sorry , lee . i just wan na tell you `` coming home in a body bag '' is one of my favorite movies . after `` apocalypse now '' i think it 's the best vietnam movie ever .
lee , clarence . please do n't insult me . call me lee .
oh , mr. donowitz -
i do n't think that 'll be necessary . let 's all have a seat . boris , why do n't you be nice and get coffee for everybody .
well , i have to admit , walkin ' through the door and seein ' these `` soldier of fortune '' poster boys made me a bit nervous . but , lee , i 'm fairly confident that you came here to do business , not to be a wise-guy . so , if you want , i 'll put the gun on the table .
i wan na be able to announce this deal at cannes . if i had time for a courtship , lee , i would . i 'd take ya out , i 'd hold your hand , i 'd kiss you on the cheek at the door . but , i 'm not in that position . i need to know if we 're in bed together , or not . if you want my movie , lee , you 're just gon na have to come to terms with your fear and desire .
well , then , what 's the hurry ? is it true the rights to `` doctor zhivago '' are in arbitration ?
now that 's bullshit , lee . every time you buy one of those little movies it 's a risk . i 'm not sellin ' you something that 's gon na play two weeks , six weeks , then go straight to cable . this is `` doctor zhivago '' . this 'll be packin ' 'em in for a year and a half . two years ! that 's two years you do n't have to work with anybody 's movie but mine .
but the bottom line is : i 'm not paramount . i have a select group of distributers i deal with . i buy their little movies . accomplish what i wan na accomplish , end of story . easy , business-like , very little risk .
the biggest . the biggest movie you 've ever dealt with , lee . we 're talkin ' a lot of film . a man 'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that . and lee , you 're no idiot .
i do n't know , clarence , `` doctor zhivago '' is a pretty big movie .
yeah , well , just stay outta trouble . remeber , you got a wife to think about . quit fuckin ' around . i love you son .
we do make a cute couple , do n't we ?
well , son , i want you to know i hope everything works out with you and alabama . i like her . i think you make a cute couple .
keep it .
i got some money i can give you -
thanks a lot , daddy . you really came through for me .
naw , until they hear something better they 'll assume drexl and blue lou had a falling out . so , once you leave twon , i would n't worry about it .
that 's what i 've been tellin ' ya . the guy was like a mad dog . so the cops are n't looking for me ?
gangster . drug dealer . somebody you do n't want on your ass . look , clarence , the more i hear about this drexl fucker , the more i think you did the right thing . that guy was n't just some wild flake .
who is he ?
if you do n't hang around in this circle , no reason it should .
nope .
yeah . drexl had an association with a fella named blue lou boyle . name mean anything to you ?
no shit ?
apparently , drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that .
do tell . why drug related ?
they have nothing . in fact , they think it 's drug related .
look , goddamnit , i never asked you for a goddamn thing ! i 've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible . after mom divorced you , did i ask you for anything ? when i would n't see ya for six months to a year at a time , did you ever get your shit about it ? no , it was always `` ok '' , `` no problem '' , `` you 're a busy guy , i understand '' . the whole time you were a drunk , did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit ? no ! everybody else did . i never did . you see , i know that you 're just a bad parent . you 're not really very good at it . but i know you love me . i 'm basically a pretty resourceful guy . if i did n't really need it i would n't ask . and if you say no , do n't worry about it . i 'm gone . no problems .
you got it all worked out , do n't you ?
i 'm your son .
what makes you think i would do that ?
you were a cop .
what makes you think i could do that ?
could you find out if they know anythin ' ? i do n't know they know shit about us . but i do n't wan na think , i wan na know . you could find out for sure what 's goin ' on . daddy ?
yes , i still have friends on the force .
do you still have friends on the force ?
stop acting like an infant . you 're here because you want me to help you in some way . what do you need from me ? you need money ?
what ?
what do you want from me ?
you 're always making jokes . that 's what you do , is n't it ? make jokes . making jokes is the one thing you 're good at , is n't it ? but if you make a joke about this - - i 'm gon na go completely out of my fuckin ' head !
look , i do n't know this is pretty heavy-duty , so if you wan na explode , feel free .
daddy , i 'm in big fuckin ' trouble and i really need your help .
clarence , just shut up , you 're giving me a headache ! i ca n't believe how much like your mother you are . you 're your fuckin ' mother through and through . i have n't heard from ya in three years . then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning . you walk in like a goddamn bulldozer ... do n't get me wrong , i 'm happy to see you ... just slow it down . now , when did you get married ?
daddy . nice is n't the word . nice is an insult . she 's a peach . that 's the only word for it , she 's a peach . she even tastes like a peach . you can tell i 'm in love with her . you can tell by my face , ca n't ya ? it 's a dead giveaway . it 's written all over it . ya know what ? she loves me back . take a seat , pop , we got ta talk -
she seems very nice .
is n't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life ? is she a four alarm fire , or what ?
you do n't know the chicken places around where you live ? ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is .
i really do n't know .
you know what would taste good ? chicken . i have n't had chicken in a while . chicken would really hit the spot about now . chicken and beer , definitly , absolutely , without a doubt . where 's a good chicken place around here ?
i 'm really not very -
get a six-pack of something imported . it 's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things . if they got fosters , get that , if not , ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has . look , since you 're making a beer run , would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well . i 'm fuckin ' starvin ' to death . are you hungry too ?
uh , yeah ... there 's a party store down 54th .
go to the liquor store - where is there a liquor store around here ?
that 's about all i ever eat .
i can , but i do n't .
anything stronger ? oh , probably not . beer ? you can drink beer , ca n't you ?
i think there 's a seven-up in there .
it 's a fact . sicilians have nigger blood pumpin ' through their hearts . if you do n't believe me , look it up . you see , hundreds and hundreds of years ago the moors conquered sicily . and moors are niggers . way back then , sicilians were like the wops in northern italy . blond hair , blue eyes . but , once the moors moved in there , they changed the whole country . they did so much fuckin ' with the sicilian women , they changed the blood-line for ever , from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin . i find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day , hundreds of years later , sicilians still carry that nigger gene . i 'm just quotin ' history . it 's a fact . it 's written . your ancestors were niggers . your great , great , great , great , great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger , and had a half-nigger kid . that is a fact . now tell me , am i lyin ' ?
come again ?
you know i read a lot . especially things that have to do with history . i find that shit fascinating . in fact , i do n't know if you know this or not , sicilians were spawned by niggers .
uh-huh .
oh , do n't bother . i got one . so you 're a sicilian , huh ?
sure .
could i have one of those chesterfields now ?
they did n't tell me .
i 'm gettin ' angry askin ' the same question a second time . where did they go ?
on their honeymoon .
that 's of minor importance . but what 's of major fuckin ' importance is that i believe you . where did they go ?
i do n't believe you .
i 'm talkin ' about a massacre . they snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there . wouldda gotten away with it , but your son , fuckhead that he is , left his driver 's license in a dead guy 's hand . a whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks .
what are you talkin ' about ?
now i ca n't be sure of how much of what he told you . so in the chance you 're in the dark about some of this , let me shed some light . that whore your boy hangs around with , her pimp is an associate of mine , and i do n't just mean pimpin ' , in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity . well , apparently , that dirty little whore found out when we 're gon na do some business , 'cause your son , the cowboy and his flame , came in the room blastin ' and did n't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead .
i 've seen him .
look , i 'd help ya if i could , but i have n't seen clarence -
i have a son of my own . about you boy 's age . i can imagine how painful this must be for you . but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves . and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em . you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice .
no .
i 'm glad . hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you 've been asking yourself . now , we 're gon na have a little q and a , and , at the risk of sounding redundant , please make your answers genuine . want a chesterfield ?
i 've heard of blue lou boyle .
i 'm the anti-christ . you get me in a vendetta kind of mood , you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you . my name is vincenzo coccotti . i work as a counsel for mr. blue lou boyle , the man your son stole from . i hear you were once a cop so i assume you 've heard od us before . am i correct ?
i give up . who are you ?
do you know who i am , mr. worley ?
shit , are you behind . me and robin got a divorce six months ago . got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom , ceiling fans above the bed . guy 'd have to look as ugly as king kong not to get laid in this place . i 'm serious , a guy 'd have to look like a gorilla .
you and robin moved ?
i do n't see why not . when you gon na come round and see my new place ?
i do n't know him . is he a nice guy ? you think he 'll help me out ?
mcteague .
yeah , and the restaurant 's on my route . and you know , i stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins . now , while i have no proof , the name drexl spivey kept comin ' up who 's case is it ?
are you still working security for foster & langley ?
well , ted , to tell you the truth , i found out through the grapevine that it might be , and i only said might be , the drexl spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on riverdale .
what about him ?
it 's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago , drexl spivey .
well , do n't just sit there , shoot him .
i do n't know . he just appeared as magic .
where 'd he come from ?
absolutely .
could we try it now ?
sure . no problem .
if we decided on making him a new york type , could you do that ?
thank you .
that was very good .
well , do n't just sit there , shoot him .
i do n't know . he just appeared as magic .
where 'd you come from ?
well , the part you 're reading for is one of the bad guys . there 's brian and marty . peter breck 's already been cast as brian . and you 're reading for the part of marty . now in this scene you 're both in a car and bill shatner 's hanging on the hood . and what you 're trying to do is get him off . whenever you 're ready .
step inside .
i 'm me ... i mean , that 's me .
look , we do n't care if you bring in the state milita , the volunteer fire department , the l.a. thunderbirds , the ghost of steve mcqueen , and the twelve roman gladiators , so long as we get credit for the bust .
dirty cops . we 'll have to bring in internal affairs on this .
we talked him into it .
he 'll wear a wire ?
i believe he believes him .
do you believe him ?
sure was .
that was a good fuckin ' movie .
uh-huh .
that vietnam movie ?
okee-dokee . it 's like this , krinkle ; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding , they walk up to window and the guy 's covered in coke . so they bring his ass in and me an ' nicholson go to work on him .
both you , idiots shut up , i ca n't understand shit ! now , what 's happened , what 's going on , and what are you talking about ?
you 're an actor , so act , motherfucker .
do n't blow it , elliot . he 's bluffin ' . he just told you so himself .
this guy 's gon na kill him .
he 's bluffin ya , elliot . ca n't you see that ? you 're an actor , remember , the show must go on .
whatta we gon na do ? he 's in an elevator .
we got ta get him outta there .
he knows something 's up .
how 's he supposed to see the wire ?
he saw the wire .
how the fuck could he know ?
he knows .
hope you 're a good actor , elliot .
you do .
you do more than try .
so you got ta get him to admit on tape that he 's buying this coke .
we have to show in court that , without a doubt , a successful man , an important figure in the hollywood community , is also dealing cocaine .
like gang-busters . now , remember , if you do n't want to go to jail , we got ta put your boss in jail .
this rabbit 'll do anything not to do time , including wearing a wire .
he 's so spooked he 'd turn over his momma , his daddy , his two-panny granny , and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him .
he produced `` coming home in a body bag '' .
to front for him . so elliot is workin ' out the deal between them and his boss , a big movie producer named lee donowitz .
suspect 's words -
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin ' . and , krinkle , you ai n't gon na fuckin ' believe it .
which was n't too hard , the guy was a real squid .
nicholson and i go to work on him . now er know somthing 's rotten in denmark , 'cause this dickhead had a big bag , and it 's uncut , too , so we 're sweatin ' him , trying to find out where he got it . scarin ' the shit outta him .
nicholson and i .
krinkle , you 're lookin ' at the two future cops of the month . we have it , and if i say we , i do n't mean me and him , i 'm referring to the whole department . have n't had a decent bust this whole month . well , we mighta come in like a lamb , but we 're goin ' out like a lion -
krinkle , this is it . we got it , man . and it 's all ours . i mean talk about fallin ' into somethin ' . you shoulda seen it , it was beautiful . dimes is hittin ' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers , i 'm hittin ' him form the right about not likin ' pussy anymore , finally he starts cryin ' , and then it was all over -
that is , of course , if you do n't catch aids from all your anal intrusions .
'course you 'll wan na fuck her in the ass . pussy just wo n't feed right anymore -
and just think , when you get out in a few years , you 'll meet some girl , get married , and you 'll be so understanding to your wife 's needs , because you 'll know what it 's like to be a woman .
but there is a bright side though . if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers , you 'll have so much experience to draw on -
you 're a fuckin ' star ! and you 're gon na be playin ' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin ' years for a captive audience -
or a supporting actor -
or a bit player -
you 're no longer an extra -
you got caught . it 's all fun and fuckin ' games till you get caught . but now we gotcha . ok , mr. elliot actor , you 've just made the big time -
no do n't sit here and feed us some shit .
but a fuckin ' baggie .
not a tiny little vial -
look , sunshine , we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
look in the hamper . linda 's been dumpin ' everybody 's stray clothes there lately .
i 'm tryin ' to find my jacket .
i 'll keep lover boy here entertained . you know the first thing i 'll do when she gets here . i think i 'll make her suck my dick , and i 'll come all in her face . i mean it ai n't nuttin ' new . she 's done it before . but i want you as a audience . marty , what the fuck are you doin ' ?
shit , man , you done fucked up again . next time you bogart your way into a nigger 's crib , an ' get all his face , make sure you do it on white boy day .
naw , man , it ai n't white boy day .
you see what you get when you fuck wit me , white boy ? you 're gon na walk in my goddamn house , my house ! gon na come in here and tell me ! talkin ' smack , in my house , in front of my employees . shit ! your ass must be crazy . i do n't think that white boy 's got good sense . hey , marty . he must of thought it was white boy day . it ai n't white boy day , is it ?
naw . it do n't feel too good but it 's alright .
you ok ? that stupid dumb-ass did n't break your nose , did he ?
pussy love pink rocks .
looky here , you want the bitches to really fly high , make your rocks with cherry seven-up .
you ai n't seen nothin ' like these rock whores . they ass be young man . they got that fine young pussy . bitches want the rock they be a freak for you . they give you hips , lips , and fingertips .
rock whores .
what was i sayin ' ?
with that terrible mug of yours if jayne kennedy told you to eat her pussy , kiss her ass , lick her feet , chow on her shit , and suck her dog 's dick , nigger , you 'd aim to please .
if it came down to who eats who , damn skippy .
you tell jayne kennedy to fuck it ?
i tell jayne kennedy , `` suck my dick or i 'll beat your ass ! ''
why you trippin ' ? we jus ' fuckin ' with ya . but i wan na ask you a question . you with some fine bitch , i mean a brick shithouse bitch - you 're with jayne kennedy . you 're with jayne kennedy and you say `` bitch , suck my dick ! '' and then jayne kennedy says , `` first things first , nigger , i ai n't suckin ' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush ! '' now , what do you say ?
well fuck you guys then ! you guys are fucked up !
then , after a while sisters use to gettin ' their little pussy eat . and because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves , you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere .
- because it 's good !
yeah , that 's right , laugh . it 's so funny , oh it 's so funny . there used to be a time when sisters did n't know shit about gettin ' their pussy licked . then the sixties came an ' they started fuckin ' around with white boys . and white boys are freaks for that shit -
look here . if i ever did eat some pussy - i would never eat any pussy - but , if i did eat some pussy , i sure as hell would n't tell no goddamn body . i 'd be ashamed as a motherfucker .
preach on , big d .
nigger , you lie like a big dog .
naw man , that 's some serious shit .
that 's bullshit .
naw man , i do n't be eatin ' that shit .
nigger , get outta my face with that bullshit .
read my lips .
you 're the one who wanted to drive fast .
no .
put it in your pants .
i 'm not wearing a bra .
please , they 'll be here any minute . just put it in your bra .
no way , jos .
they wo n't search you . i promise . you have n't done anything .

how do you know ? you been there ?
naw , they ai n't stayin ' here . but , i know who you 're talkin ' about . they 're stayin ' at the hollywood holiday inn .
maybe you can help me . actually , who i 'm looking for is a friend of ours from detroit . clarence worley ? i heard he was in town . might be travelling with a pretty girl named alabama . have you seen him ? are they stayin ' here ?
exactly room-mates .
sorta room-mates ?
yeah , i live here .
do you live here ?
naw , he ai n't home right now .
hello , is dick ritchie here ?
well , you go down beechwood ...
where 's that ?
he 's at the beverly wilshire .
do you know where we can find him ?
yes .
do you know a clarence worley ?
no .
are you dick ritchie ?
yes .
donowitz , he said .
what was the jew-boy 's name ?
shut your mouth . nick cardella was provin ' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy 's nutsack . what sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on nick cardella ? nick cardella 's a stand-up guy .
i did n't mean -
then where the hell do you get off talkin ' that kind of talk ?
no .
excuse me , mr. coccotti . do you know nick cardella ?
we 're going to think about it , cole . among ourselves . we 'll get back to you .
i understand . there 'd be no point .
well , sir , i do n't think the human mind was built to exist in two different ... whatever you call it ... '' dimensions . '' it 's stressful , you said it yourselves , it gets you confused . you do n't know what 's real and what 's not .
you said we were n't `` real , '' cole ...
no , sir ! i just want to do my part . to get us back on top ... in charge of the planet . and i have the experience , i know who the people are ...
the food , the sky , the certain , uh , sexual temptations -- you have n't become `` addicted '' have you , cole ? to that `` dying '' world '
i do n't want your `` women , '' you brainless twit ! i want to be well !
women will want to get to know you ...
uh , i think so . in the mental hospital .
him ? you saw that man ?
uh , what ?
well ?
we have a very advanced program , something very different , requires very skilled people .
no , sir !
uh , i did n't hear the ...
wake up , cole .
i went to the surface and i collected specimens like i was told .
we want you to tell us about last night .
this is it , james ... what you 've been working for .
we 're very close ! because of you !
you 're still a little ... disoriented .
but just until you recover your , uh , ... equilibrium .
cole , did you or did you not record that message ?
he 's drugged out of his mind ! he 's completely zoned out .
for a man in your position ... an opportunity .
we want tough minded people . strong mentally . we 've had some ... misfortunes with `` unstable '' types .
you do n't want to jeopardize that reduction , do you , cole ? have it taken away ?
to be determined by the proper authorities .
hey , no problem , it 's probably just another kidnapping featuring jeffrey 's shrink , pardon me , make that ex-shrink . this is your leader , a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for god knows what whacko irresponsible schemes , and now who knows what she 's painted out there on our wall ?
wow , a guy in a chevy is chasing her and some other guy i ca n't see .
she 's drawing attention to us , that 's what she 's doing . ... i do n't know what you 're up to this time , mason , but you 're gon na get us in deep shit !
what 's she doing ?
it 's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up .
what are you going to do with us ?
that 's him .
shut up !
i told you that fuckhead mason would get us into something like this .
uh , so that a vaccine can be developed that will , uh , allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth .
so that ... ? ? ?
to find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus .
and your only goal is ... ? ? ?
that the virus was taken from philadelphia to san francisco , then to new orleans , rio de janeiro , rome , kinshasa , karachi , bangkok , then peking .
meaning ... ? ? ?
san francisco , new orleans , rio de janeiro , rome , kinshasa , karachi , bangkok , then peking .
and it appeared sequentially after that in ... ?
it was released in philadelphia , probably on june 14 , 1995 .
let 's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june 28 , 1995 , that makes us know that ... ?
i got into trouble . i got arrested . but i still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but i did n't have anyplace to put it , so i ate it . it was the wrong year anyway , so i guess it does n't matter .
forced you ! why would someone force you to take drugs ?
they forced me to take drugs .
i think it was ... i 'm sure it was 2nd street .
it 's important to observe everything .
i 'll get the tickets and meet you ... in the gift shop .
right ! you 're right . i have to fix this .
james , if we 're identified , they 're going to send us someplace ... but not to key west !
i was here ... as a kid . i think you were here , too . but you ... looked just like you look now .
they may be looking for us , james . use this . you can fix it in the men 's room .
airports all look the same . maybe it 's ... james ! your moustache ! it 's slipping .
i know this place ! ... this is my dream .
on the walls -- they meant the animals when they said , `` we did it . ''
that 's what they were up to ! freeing animals !
i remember you ... like this . i feel i 've known you before . i feel i 've always known you .
i mean in my dream -- i did n't realize it was you . then ... i woke up and i ... i thought you were gone .
well , you look pretty different , too .
you were in my dream just now . i did n't recognize you .
in a few weeks , it will have started or it wo n't . if there are still baseball games and traffic jams , armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we 'll be so happy , we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police .
but maybe i 'm wrong . maybe you 're wrong . maybe we 're both crazy .
so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music . so we can appreciate what we have while we have it . forgive me , psychiatrists do n't cry .
why are we doing this ?
flowers ! what flowers ?
if we ca n't change anything ... because it 's already happened , then we ought to at least smell the flowers .
i have seen it , but i do n't remember this part . funny , it 's like what 's happening to us , like the past . the movie never changes -- it ca n't change -- but everytime you see it , it seems to be different because you 're different -- you notice different things .
shh -- do n't talk . hold still .
i think i 've seen this movie before . when i was a kid . it was on tv .
they got your message , kathryn . they played it for me . it was a bad recording ... distorted . i did n't recognize your voice .
you ... you could n't have heard me .
i could n't resist . i was so relieved . wait 'll they hear this nutty woman telling them ... they better watch out for the army of the twelve monkeys ...
you ... you left them a message ?
no superiors ! no scientists . no people from the future . it 's just a carpet cleaning company . they have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned .
a carpet cleaning company ?
it 's a carpet cleaning company ...
i ... i ... we need cash , james .
you want me to rob him ?
james ... do you remember ... six years ago ... you had a phone number ! you tried to call and ...
i want to be here . in this time . with you . i want to become ... become a whole person . i want this to be the present . i want the future to be unknown .
well , i ca n't . ... i mean ... i 'm trying to . i ca n't believe that everything we do or say has already happened , that we ca n't change what 's going to happen , that i 'm one of the three billion people who are going to die ... soon .
you said i had delusions -- that i created a world -- you said you could explain everything ...
you had a bullet from world war one in your leg , james ! how did it get there ?
... i had a dream about ... something like that .
what does this mean to you ?
it was n't a tv show ! it was real !
i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid . where a boy ...
james , you said he was hiding in the barn ...
it was ? i did n't ... know .
the boy in the well . how did you know that was just a hoax ?
i do n't know -- i do n't remember .
you disappeared ! one minute you were there , the next minute you were gone . did you run through the woods ?
no , not really . it 's ... it 's in my mind . like you said .
just like that ? you were in prison ?
i thought i was in ... prison again .
okay ... you were standing there looking at the moon ... you were eating grass ... then what ?
you mean , treat me ? cure me ? kathryn , those words on the wall -- i 've seen them before ... i ... i ... dreamed them .
we 're avoiding the police until i can ... .talk to you .
i do n't understand what we 're doing .
no , i want to turn myself in . where is he ? do n't worry -- it 's all okay now . i 'm not crazy any more ! i mean , i am crazy , mentally divergent , actually , but i know it now and i want you to help me . i want to get well ...
james ! that 's a policeman . pretend you do n't know me . if he sees you ...
no gun ! stars ! air ! i can live here . breathe !
you 're sure ?
the gun ! ... i lost it
give me the gun .
it would be great if i 'm crazy . if i 'm wrong about everything ... the world will be okay . i 'll never have to live underground .
first , it 's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running . okay ?
i need help all right . they 're coming after me .
it can be dealt with , but only if you want to . i can help you .
i 'm ... '' mentally divergent '' . i would love to believe that .
nobody is going to wipe out the human race . not you or jeffrey or anybody else . you 've created something in your mind , james -- a substitute reality . in order to avoid something you do n't want to face .
jeffrey mason said it was my idea about the virus . and suddenly , i was n't sure . we talked when i was in the institution , and it was all ... fuzzy . the drugs and stuff . you think maybe i 'm the one who wiped out the human race ? it was my idea ?
what made you think that ?
yeah , sort of , i guess . i ... i 'm sorry i locked you up . i thought ... i thought ... i think maybe i am crazy !
see -- you can drive after all !
no ! i ... do n't think so . i stole a car and they chased me . i hit a tree .
what have you done ? did you ... kill someone ?
you have to give yourself up , you know .
you smell so good .
that has your name on it . give him cash .
no . i want you to turn yourself in , james -- it 'll go much better for you if you do -- but i 'm not going to trick you .
you were going to run out off gas on purpose , were n't you ?
it was some kind of ... war . never mind , you would n't believe me . turn off here .
shot ! who shot you ?
i got shot . look -- there 's a gas station up ahead .
what 's the matter with your leg ?
i said i was too young to drive . i did n't say i was stupid .
i thought you did n't know how to drive .
we need gas .
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist .
the guy was a total fruitcake .
you know dr. mason 's son , jeffrey mason , do n't you , james ? you met him in the county hospital six years ago .
all i see are dead people . everywhere . what 's three more ?
jeffrey mason ?
mason ? ? ?
lock it now !
james , why do n't we ... ?
i told you what i want . lock the door !
i 've got one now .
you did n't have a gun before , did you ?
i did him a favor . now come on .
oh , jesus , james ! you killed him !
uh , no . yes . i mean , just some scrapes ...
are you hurt ?
the man ... with the voice . i recognized him . he 's from the present . he ...
who 's keeping an eye on you ?
they 're keeping an eye on me .
i 'm not going to `` do '' anything , i promise . but you need help , james . none of this is what you think it is .
look , i 'm warning you . you do anything , i 'm going to go crazy -- hurt people !
nevermind . it 's not real -- it 's a hoax . a prank . he 's hiding in a barn . hey , turn left here . left !
what do you mean -- when you were a kid ?
when i was a kid i identified with that kid , down there alone in that pipe ... a hundred feet down -- does n't know if they 're going to save him .
does that disturb you , james ? thinking about that little boy in the well ?
i just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates . so scientists can come back and study it and find a cure . so that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth .
what will you do ... when you find this ... secret army ?
a secret army . the army of the twelve monkeys . i 've told you about them . they spread the virus . that 's why we have to get to philadelphia . i have to find them -- it 's my assignment .
clues ? what kind of clues ?
my notes . observations . clues .
you 're flushed . and you were moaning . i think you 're running a fever . what are you doing ?
no , i think it was always you . it 's very strange .
it was n't me before , james . it 's become me now because of ... what 's happening . please untie me .
you were very upset . you 're always very upset in the dream , but i never knew it was you before .
and i was in it ? what did i do ?
about an airport ... before everything happened . it 's the same dream i always have -- the only one . i 'm a little kid in it .
we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours . what was the dream about ?
you were in my dream just now . your hair was different , but i 'm sure it was you .
ohhhh , that one ! can we hear that one ?
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ? something so bad ... ?
something bad . is that all the music ? i do n't want to hear this stuff ...
`` if something really happens '' ... like what , james ?
my father told me that . `` never cry wolf . '' then people wo n't believe you if ... something really happens .
what ?
`` never cry wolf ! ''
everybody 's got a gun . in this city ...
you 'd prefer that ? ... james ... you do n't really have a gun , do you .
you used to call me `` james '' .
it 's the next step . i checked out the baltimore information , it was nothing . it 's philadelphia , that 's where they are , the ones who killed everyone . zs that a radio ? does it play music ?
yes , i remember . why do you want to go to philadelphia ?
you told me you 'd help me . i know this is n't what you meant , but ... i was desperate ... no money ... bum leg ... sleeping on the streets . i probably smell bad . sorry about that . but then i saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture . i can read , remember ?
i ca n't believe this is a coincidence , mr. cole . have you been ... following me ?
1989. six years for you . there 's the sign ! right here !
cole ! james cole ! you escaped from a locked room six years ago .
i have to do this , james . you 're very confused .
no more drugs . please ...
it 's just a shot to calm you .
wait ! this is only 1989 ! i 'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. it 's not the right number yet . that 's the problem . damn ! how can i contact them ?
i have the ... strangest feeling i 've met you before ... a long time ago , perhaps . were you ever ... ?
what ?
james , where did you grow up ? was it around here ? around baltimore ?
no . that 's the reason they chose me -- i remember things .
perhaps it was a wrong number ...
it was some lady . she did n't know anything .
1995 is the future , james . this is 1989 .
no , 1995 is the past .
you think it 's july of 1995 ? that 's the future , james . do you think you 're living in the future ?
1995 ?
what year do you think it is ?
what year is it ?
do you know what year it is ?
july ? !
july .
this is april , right ?
why do you think there are n't any germs in the air , james ?
i have to go .
you 're afraid of germs ?
it 's so clean . no germs .
what 's wonderful about the air , james ?
i love this air . this is wonderful air .
hiding ?
underground .
a jail ? prison ?
i have to go .
you 've been in an institution , have n't you , james ? a hospital ?
you would n't understand .
why not ? most people have some id .
no .
you do n't have a driver 's license , james ? or a social security card ?
they wanted identification . i do n't have any identification . i was n't trying to hurt them .
i see . you do n't remember assaulting a police officer ... several officers ?
because i 'm a good observer . because i have a tough mind .
do you know why you 're here , james .
i need to go .
change what ?
it wo n't help you . you ca n't do anything about it . you ca n't change anything .
what kind of information ?
no , not possible . listen , i have to get out of here . i 'm supposed to be getting information .
have you been a patient at county ? have i seen you someplace ?
`` james '' ! nobody ever calls me that .
i 'm going to be completely honest . i 'm not going to lie to you . i ca n't make the police let you go ... but i do want to help you . and i want you to trust me . can you do that , james ? may i call you `` james '' ?
i need to go now .
mr. cole ? my name is doctor railly . i 'm a psychiatrist . i work for the county -- i do n't work for the police . my only concern is your well being -- do you understand that ?
no , no . i ca n't talk to them . it 's called , `` voice mail '' . i 'm supposed to leave messages . they monitor it from the present .
so you could talk to these scientists and they do what ? send you to the future ?
scientists . i 'm supposed to report in to them . they 'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time .
who would you call , mr. cole , who would straighten everything out ?
no ! look , i do n't belong here ! what i need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out .
does this bother you , mr. cole ?
listen , you dumb fuck ! the thing mutates we live underground ! the world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats . we 're like moles or worms . all we want to do is study the original ...
and that 's when i told you my father was this famous virologist and you said , `` hey , he could make a germ and we could steal it ! ''
bulishit ! you 're fucking with my head !
remember ? we were in the dayroom , watching tv , and you were all upset about the ... desecration of the planet . and you said to me , `` would n't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are ? '' you do remember that , do n't you ?
plan ? what are you talking about ?
i get it ! this is your old plan , right ?
i do n't have time to go upstairs . the police are looking for me . i need to know where it is and exactly what it is .
i just need to have access to the pure virus , that 's all ! for the future !
we need to talk . come on . upstairs . i am a new person ! i 'm completely adjusted . witness the tux . it 's armani . who chattered ? goines ? weller ?
listen to me -- i ca n't do anything about what you 're going to do . i ca n't change anything . i ca n't stop you . i just want some information ...
county hospital , right ? 1989. the `` immaculate escape '' -- am i right ? why , thank you -- you look wonderful , too .
monkeys . twelve of them .
excuse me -- what did you say ?
i 'm here about some monkeys .
that would be totally out of character . helping people is against my principles . see , he definitely does n't know me . now , i 'm going to go back and listen to my father 's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science while you torture this intruder to death .
you do know me . you helped me once .
never saw him before in my life . go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do .
not , `` what '' , babe ! when !
what ... ? ? ?
wooooo , they really dosed you , bro . major load ! listen up -- try and get it together . focus ! focus ! the plan ! remember ? i did my part .
what ... . ? ? ?
a lawsuit ? you going to sue them ?
it 's private .
what 're you writing ? you a reporter ?
you know -- your plan .
what are you talking about ? ? ?
wiping cut the human race ! that 's a great idea ! but it 's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals . i did n't say a word about `` you know what '' .
look at those assholes , they 're asking for it ! maybe people deserved to be wiped out !
not as bad as what they 're doing to kitty .
they hurt you !
i 've managed to contact certain underlings , evil spirits , secretaries of secretaries , and assorted minions , who will contact my father . when he learns i 'm in this kind of place , he 'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you ... properly . like a guest ! like a person ! sheets ! towels ! like a big hotel with great drugs for the nut case lunatic maniac devils ...
what 's that mean ?
why do n't i escape , that 's what you were going to ask me , right ? 'cause i 'd be crazy to escape ! i 'm all taken care of , see ? i 've sent out word .
if you know how to escape , why do n't you ... ?
of course not , i never thought you were . you want to escape , right ? that 's very sane . i can help you . you want me to , do n't you ? get you out ?
i 'm not crazy .
`` what about the germs ? '' i say . he goes , `` i do n't believe in germs . germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap ! '' now , he 's crazy , right ? hey , you believe in germs , do n't you ?
in the 18th century there was no such thing ! nobody 'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway . along comes this doctor ... semmelweiss , i think . he tries to convince people ... other doctors mostly ... that there are these teeny tiny invisible `` bad things '' called germs that get into your body and make you ... sick ! he 's trying to get doctors to wash their hands . what is this guy ... crazy ? teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em ? ... `` germs '' !
germs ? !
a telephone call ? that 's communication with the outside world ! doctor 's discretion . hey , if alla these nuts could just make phone calls , it could spread . insanity oozing through telephone cables , oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people , infecting them ! whackos everywhere ! a plague of madness . in fact , very few of us here are actually mentally ill. i 'm not saying you 're not mentally ill , for all i know you 're crazy as a loon . but that 's not why you 're here . why you 're here is because of the system , because of the economy . there 's the tv . it 's all right there . commercials . we are not productive anymore , they do n't need us to make things anymore , it 's all automated . what are we for then ? we 're consumers . okay , buy a lot of stuff , you 're a good citizen . but if you do n't buy a lot of stuff , you know what ? you 're mentally ill ! that 's a fact ! if you do n't buy things ... toilet paper , new cars , computerized blenders , electrically operated sexual devices ... screwdrivers with miniature built-in radar devices , stereo systems with brain implanted headphones , voice- activated computers , and ...
i need to make a telephone call .
what 'd they give you ? thorazine ? how much ? learn your drugs -- know your doses .
who am i supposed to shoot ?
they gave you a pardon , man . whatdaya want ?
it 's about obeying , about doing what you 're told .
hey , man ...
this part is n't about the virus , is it ?
hey , five minutes ago , thirty years ago ! yes , that phone call . i been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since i got back from that ... `` weird '' war we were in . you remember that ? here , take it , man ! you could still be a hero if you 'd cooperate !
the call i just made ? five minutes ago ?
the phone call , man . the phone call .
how did you find me ?
me ? are you kiddin ? you 're the one ! you were a hero , man . they gave you a pardon ! and whadda you do ? you come back and fuck with your teeth ! wow !
pulling out the tooth , man , that was nuts ! here , take this .
jo ... jose ? ? ? ?
cole ! oh , god , cole , where are we ?
jose !
yes , sir .
but you know what 's real now ?
i could n't call ! you sent me to the wrong year ! it was 1989 .
it 's a digital reconstruction of a message , cole , from a weak signal on our contact number . did you make that call ?
uh , that message ... me ?
well , the guard woke me up . he told me i volunteered .
i asked you , why did you volunteer ?
we 'll get to the spider later , mr. cole . right now , we want to know everything that you saw .
i mashed the spider , did n't i ?
and what we believe is what 's accepted as `` truth '' now , is n't it , owen ? psychiatry -- it 's the latest religion . and we 're the priests -- we decide what 's right and what 's wrong -- we decide who 's crazy and who is n't . ... i 'm in trouble , owen . i 'm losing my faith .
kathryn , you know he ca n't possibly know that . you 're a rational person . you 're a trained psychiatrist . you know the difference between what 's real and what 's not .
for god sakes , owen , listen to me -- he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die !
he kidnapped you , kathryn . you saw him murder someone . you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you , too . you were under tremendous emotional stress .
then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated , fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent , replaced the grill behind him and that he 's wriggling through the ventilation system right now ?
he was fully sedated !
you see what i mean ? you 're being defensive . is n't she being defensive , bob ?
i said it was bad judgment ! what else do you want me to say ?
two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a security officer with a fractured skull .
okay , it was bad judgment . but i have the strangest feeling about him -- i 've seen him somewhere and ...
he should have been in restraints . it was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple . why not just cop to it ?
i did n't think i was being defensive . i was just ...
do n't be defensive , kathryn , this is n't an inquisition .
this is a fucking experiment ! you 're our helpless little test animal , daddy . got that ? now -- what fucking virus have you come up with , you demented fucking maniac ?
please tell me , jeffrey , what exactly are you going to do ? i do n't have to tell you i 'm afraid .
you `` develop '' viruses and you 're calling me insane ? typical . what does this virus attack ? do n't tell me , you sick fuck , it does n't matter . have i ever `` developed '' a virus ? do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli ? do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements ? wow ! and i 'm crazy !
you 're insane , jeffrey .
what virus are we talking about , dad ?
she knew about it , jeffrey . she knew you were going to try this .
what ... virus ?
then how come she knows what 's going on ?
who cares what psychiatrists write on walls ? you think i told her about the army of the 12 monkeys ? impossible ! know why , you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous `` pretend-friend-to- animals '' ? ! i 'll tell you why : because when i had anything to do with her six years ago , there was no such thing -- i had n't even thought of it yet !
that woman is ... was ... your ... psychiatrist ? and now she 's spray- painting our building ?
ex-psychiatrist ! now , what about flashlights ? how many flashlights ... ?
your psychiatrist ? did you just say , `` your psychiatrist '' ?
why do n't we forget my goddamn psychiatrist and deal with the task at hand . this is important .
no ! absolutely not . do n't tell me anything .
you really want to know ?
one dozen bolt cutters ! whadda you gon na do with one dozen bolt cutters ?
i 'll be right here ... just in case .
no , thank you .
james cole . that 's everything we got . none of the james coles on the computer match him . no license , no prints , no warrants . nothing . you want me to go in with you ?
yes , please . you said he gave a name ...
you want to go in ? examine him ?
that would explain the bruises , i guess . the struggle .
were you listening ? we got two officers in the hospital . yeah , he 's in restraints , plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse . look at him ! still on his feet .
you have him in restraints .
negative for drugs . but he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs . no drugs . you believe that ?
he 's been tested for drugs ?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d. , and he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses . totally irrational , totally disoriented , does n't know where he is , what day it is , alla that stuff . all they got was his name . they figure he 's stoned out of his mind , it 's some kinda psychotic episode , so they 're gon na bring him ...
twelve monkeys , honey . guess you folks did n't turn on your radio this morning .
what ? what did you say ?
on your normal mornin ' , okay , plenty a time , but today , got ta take inta account your army-of-the-twelve-monkeys factor .
tight ? my watch says 7:30 .
might be tight .
nine thirty
things ai n't always the way they seem . you got to ask yourself ; is it worth it ?
any parting words of wisdom ?
same back at you .
no and i do n't plan on sticking around either . i do n't guess i 'll be seeing you again . take it easy .
we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .
more or less .
we 're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
we was born to die , boy . from the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head . you just do n't know where , or when , or how . do n't make sense worryin ' about the particulars .
you do n't fear death ?
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . people are afraid of what they ca n't see . i ca n't see nuthin ' , so it 's all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , a lick from a dog . the kiss of death . it 's all the same .
you afraid of the dark ?
night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it 's when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you 're afraid of .
you 're a hell of a pessimist , old man .
ai n't over yet . night is part of day ; separate , but equal . night is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
the day was n't so bad . we all got through it all right .
i wo n't hold my breath .
i 'm a little short . i 'll catch you next time .
ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?
think you 'll live that long ?
maybe one day i 'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise .
that 's 'cause i 've done a lot of living .
you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .
what do you want for free ?
i think i 've heard that before .
or maybe you just think you do . you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , there you are .
maybe i do .
i can see just fine . for example : you 're a young man who thinks he 's got someplace to be .
that a fact ?
just 'cause i ai n't got eyes does n't mean i ca n't see .
you sure seen a lot for a blind man .
see . ai n't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that 's where he belongs anyways . me and jesse , that 's my dog , not anymore , but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then . . .
he no !
he 's only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him ? i ca n't take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you ?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?
i hope you was n't pettin ' him none , was you ?
oh , jesus .
that 's 'cause he 's dead .
i think you 'd better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .
christ !
do n't forget to open it for me . i ca n't be opening my own bottle .
yeah , yeah .

yeah , sure . you got change ?

i ai n't got no eyes . you want to see ?
i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes .
what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?
i 'm sorry , i did n't --

no it wo n't . you just do n't know shit about statistics .
it will .
a coin 's got two sides . when you flip it there 's a fifty-fifty chance it 'll be heads or tails . boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it 'll come up each side .
it is not .

you listen to me , you fancy city man . you owe me money , and this car ai n't going nowheres until i get it . and if you take another five hours i 'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her . now get out of here ! you 're stinking up my garage .
i 'm taking my car , and i 'm taking it now !
take it . as soon as i get my money . fifty dollars for an almost new gasket . you do n't know what kind of a deal you 're getting .
listen you stupid fuck , i want my car .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .
what reputation ? you 're nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumble weed hick .
well , now , you just know all there is about bein ' a mechanic , do n't you ? i ca n't do unauthorized work . i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .
i did n't tell you to do it ! you ca n't just do unauthorized work .
yeah , but it was shot .
i did n't tell you to replace any gasket .
yep . for the hose . but while you was gone i replaced a gasket . that 's going to run you another fifty .
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty .
it 's going to cost you two-hundred dollars .
what ?
two-hundred .
listen , darrell , about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i 'm going i swear i 'll --
no charge .
that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .
you think bad , and bad is what you get .
you believe that ?
hell , i 've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . ai n't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out .
you 've been there ?
one of those days you feel like you been runnin ' in circles and you ai n't no closer to where you tryin ' to get than when you started ?
yeah , well , i 've been around the bend a bit .
hey there . i was beginnin ' to think you was n't comin ' back . you do n't look so good .
sweet talk me all you want , i still want my hundred-forty-five dollars .
you son of a bitch !
now that 's too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you 're gon na have to work this one off .
i do n't have a credit card . they took my wallet .
then you 're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole . now why do n't you just take your visa express silver card , call karl malden and have him send you the money lickity split .
listen , man . i got rolled half and hour ago for everything i had .
then you ai n't gon na have the car .
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i do n't have the money .
i do n't know , but it 's the reason i 'm living here and you 're just passing through . now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?
that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang .
that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?
that 's about an hour and a half longer than i usually spend looking for parts . you 're the one thinks that car 's so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?
about an hour and a half , because that 's all the longer i 've been gone .
a god damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half mustang . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
to replace a god damn radiator hose ! ?

damn . gon na be another hot one today .
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --

it 'd serve you right . jose , run get a mop and clean this mess up .
i think i burned my gun hand !
ned ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?
flo , i 'm just gon na help myself to a refill on the coffee .
let me get your change .
baby did n't die . just froze off all it 's finger and toes . just a little fingerless , toeless boy now . but the husband ; he sees what the wife 's done , so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it . now she died .
lord ! put the baby in the icebox . killed the poor thing .
'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring . that 's when she started shooting . ca n't blame her . the ring was all carlos left her when he died .
poor thing . is she all right ?
you pay toby no mind . he just likes to show off for his girl . give him a couple of hours , he 'll cool off . still want that beer ?
more like jenny is after every man she sees .
you know how that toby is . thinks every man he sees is after his jenny .
what was that all about ?
sheriff potter .
that was n't so bad . what 's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you ? it did n't hurt a bit .
john --
there you go , mrs. mckenna . just put it in there .
ca n't i ? you 're out in the desert , all alone , with a body in your trunk . what do you think , boy ?
do n't tell him anything . he ca n't do this .
. . .at the very least . i know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars . now , how much did you get ?
same thing you want . i want to be out of sierra ; to be able to do as i please . but that takes money .
what do you want ?
for the love of god would you two give it a rest ? lord almighty . in all my years i have never seen anything so pathetic . how far did you think you were going to get with this ? neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat . now use what little smarts you got . if i was going to bust you i would n't have waited until after you killed jake .
he killed him , sheriff ! i could n't stop him ! he made me come with him . he told me if i said a word he would kill me too .
is that the way you want it , boy ? a bullet in the head in the middle of the desert ? ends like this and you wo n't be able to spend a dime of that blood money .
john . . .
i could do that . 'course we 'd have to go back into town . there 'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened . a whole crowd of witnesses . that would n't be too pretty , now would it ?
i . . .
is that right ? ca n't say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit . i know i 've had my fill of this town . sixteen years i 've been the law and order here . so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place . help people , i guess . keep the peace . problem is there 's so much peace around here they do n't much need me . got a lot of speeders , but they 're speeding through miles of nothing so i ca n't hardly blame them . other than that , well , there ai n't much to steal . i reckon that the last big crime we had was , what would you say mrs. mckenna ? a murder ?
i had a fight with jake . i . . . i just wanted to get away for awhile . mr. stewart was kind enough to take me as far as montrose . i 'm going to take a bus to my sister 's . i thought i 'd stay with her for a few days .
taking a little trip ?
yes . yes it is .
that yours , mrs. mckenna ?
jake . no . no !
what are you afraid of ? i 'm the one 's got the gun . stay here .
oh my god , jake , no . if it is someone they 'll go away . or call the police . do n't go out there .
when did you buy a gun ?
what does it look like ?
jake , what is that ?
the wind is n't blowing .
i do n't hear anything . you were dreaming . or maybe the wind blew something over .
there 's someone in the house .
how could i ? i was sleeping .
you did n't hear something ?
what 's the matter ?
nothing , jake . absolutely nothing .
what the hell you looking at , girl ?
uh-huh
i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .
they look nice .
you have n't even looked at them once .
they look nice .
you never said anything . about the drapes .
i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
i put up new drapes , jake .
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . do n't you , grace ?
wrong number .
who was that on the phone ?
who the hell is this ! ?
jake . i thought you would be at work , dear .
fuck you ! do you hear me , john ! ? fuck you ! john . . . john ! ?
what do you say , jake ? should we trust her ? no ? i did n't think so .
for christ 's sake , john ! throw me the keys !
at least i 'll have company when i die . ai n't that right , jake ?
you idiot ! you 'll kill us both !
yeah , they 'll find you . dried up and twice dead .
someone will find me .
walk to where ? we 're fifty miles to the nearest town . it 's going to be over one-hundred degrees today . how far do you think you 're going to get ?
john , if you do n't throw me the keys , then i 'll just walk away . walk away and leave you here .
why do n't you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck ?
throw me the keys and i 'll pull you up .
and you 're not one to lie , are you ?
no . i swear it .
bullshit , grace . you were going to drive off and leave me here .
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up .
you closed it , did n't you , grace ?
it 's . . . it 's locked .
it 's not locked . i left it open when i took out jake 's body .
the trunk . it 's locked .
what for ?
john , throw me the keys .
john , you have to throw the keys up to me .
where the hell am i going to go ?
john ! can you hear me ? are you still there ?
i 'll get it .
grace , listen to me . in the trunk of my car is a rope . it should reach down here . got get it , throw it down and i 'll climb up .
i 'm here .
i ca n't make it . grace ? grace ! ?
can you climb back up .
i think i busted my leg .
are you all right ?
grace !
john !
i think you 're a lying , back stabbing bitch . but it 's nice to know you care .
i do n't want to go to mexico , john . i want to be with you . do n't you think i care about you ?
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again ? you take your hald of the money and run . you might want to try mexico . with all that dough you 'll live like a queen .
but i want to say with you ,
the police do n't know that . and it 's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck . i 'll take you as far as california . if we can even make that . after that i 'm cutting you loose .
he was a crooked bastard . he would have killed us .
< u > we < /u > killed jake . and it 's a big difference . you kill an old man , that 's one thing . nobody cares about an old man . you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you . never .
what difference does it make ? you killed jake .
are you kidding ? i 'm not going down with you for killing a cop .
but you said we could be together .
now we dump jake , split the money , then you 're on your own .
now what ?
well , nothing .
you could give me the gun .
is that the kind of girl you think i am ? what can i do to make you relax ?
you killed a man for no reason !
you 're tense . what are you all uptight about ?
i know . he was to take the fucking money .
he was going to --
jesus , grace . did you have to kill him ?
just drive .
you 're crazy , you know that ! ? you 're fucked up ! ?
it 's our money . he had no right to take it .
thirty-thousand , that 's all . we would have been free and clear . you did n't have to kill him .
he was going to take the money .
you killed him !
i shot him .
he can kill us . i do n't know about you , but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars .
he ca n't prove anything , john . he ca n't turn us in .
you heard me . count it out .
what ?
give him the money .
it does n't matter . he was there and he let it happen . he ca n't take us in .
not me . us .
that 's all talk . he 's got nothing on us . he let you kill jake .
no , you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so i could go to a hanging alone .
damn you ! what did you do that for ? he ca n't prove anything .
one-hundred-thousand dollars . a little more .
you liar ! you wanted him dead . you seduced me into killing him !
sheriff potter , please . i ca n't go to jail . i wanted no part of it .
grace ! just . . . let me handle this . sheriff , i 'm telling you there 's nothing in that trunk . if that 's not good enough for you , then i 'd be happy to open it . just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant .
john . . . ?
funny thing .
had push it in . funny thing ; it would n't start .
yeah . good thinking .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep in the garage . figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away . might buy us some time .
i . . . nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . hurt like hell . . . that 's all .
john ! ? what the hell 's the matter with you ?
put some clothes on him . when i get back we 'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert . it 'll takes days for anybody to find him .
wait . what about . . . him ?
to get my car .
where are you going ?
get it , and put the money in it . pack up anything else you want to take with you .
never needed one . i 've never been anywhere . i 've got a backpack .
you got a suitcase ?
let him watch . i want him to know what he 's missing .
what about him ?
let 's do it here .
no .
let 's go in the bedroom .
we 're going all the way . together .
if you want .
i told you . i knew it was there . did n't i tell you ?
there 's easily a hundred-thousand in there . more than that .
do n't yell at me ! i know it 's here ! i know it !
you 're calling jake stupid ? you ! ?
if it is n't here , why would he wear that stupid key ?
this is good . this is real good . this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us . they 'll probably just lock us up for being idiots .
it 's got to be here . i heard him talk about it . he bragged about it . six steps out , three left .
there is n't ! there 's nothing under here but more floor . jesus fucking christ ! we killed a man for nothing but floor .
there has to be !
nothing . there 's no safe under here .
do n't yell at me !
oh , that 's great . we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you 've never seen . that 's fucking brilliant !
i 'm not sure where it is . not exactly . i never saw it . i just heard him talk about it .
you do n't know ? jesus christ ! do n't you think you should have found out before we killed him ?
i do n't know .
where 's the safe ?
you could have hit him , or kneed him in the balls .
what was i supposed to do ?
why the hell did n't you do anything ?
after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .
grace . . . grace ?
we do n't have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away .
you said you could n't kill anybody .
the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake . but i 've had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we 've got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you 're what i want .
are you sure ? about me , i mean ?
i do n't give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there 's only one way to do that .
is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
i could if i had jake 's money .
i thought you could n't leave . i thought you could n't get your car .
i mean it , grace . i 'm getting out of here , and i want to take you with me .
because i know you 're full of shit .
why ? am i making you hot , or does the truth scare you ?
stop it .
i 've thought about you every second since i left . i can still taste you on my lips .
except i ca n't get you out of my head , grace .
there is no us , remember ?
what about us ?
i do n't think we have anything to talk about .
i wanted to talk .
i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now . is there something you wanted ?
jesus christ ! listen to yourself ! i ca n't do it , grace . i ca n't do it .
it 's not like he 's a young man . he 's had time to live .
shit !
is it so bad ? it would be quick . he would n't even have to feel it .
kill someone . i ca n't do it .
what are you talking about ?
i do n't know what i was thinking , but i ca n't do it .
john , please --
i think this heat is making me crazy . i was crazy to come back here , i 'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town , and i 'd sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute in this place .
john ? john where are you going ?
we 'd have to kill him .
if the key 's on him , to get the key we 'd have to . . .
it 's not a combination lock . it takes a key . he keeps it on him all the time . i mean all the time . it scratches up against me when we do it .
i . . . nothing . just something he said . so if the money 's in a safe we 'd have to get the combination --
lied ? what do you mean ?
one-hundred-thousand ! ? that son-of- a-bitch lied to me .
near as i can figure must be about a hundred-thousand .
how much money has he got ?
yeah , a bird in a gilded cage .
you live pretty good .
he 's got money . in a floor safe in the living room . i 've never seen it , but he talks about it all the time . more like brags . he loves his money . would n't think of spending some of it on me .
from ?
he does n't give it to us . we take it .
you think jake 's going to give me money just so i can take you out of here ?
jake .
where ?
i know where we could get the money . a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars .
grace , i ca n't . i ca n't even get out of here myself . i need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic .
please . i wo n't hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i do n't care . i just want to get out of here .
i ca n't .
take me with you .
beautiful . beautiful beaches . blue water and clear skies as far as you can see .
is it pretty ?
yeah .
have you ever been there before ?
from here ? i do n't know . far . far enough .
how far is it to california ?
whatever it takes .
is that so bad ? it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy . for awhile , anyway . i mean , i would . . . do things for him . i guess i 'm no good that way . i guess i tried to sucker you along like that . do you hate me for it ? i would n't blame you if you did . but maybe it 's like you said : you just got to do whatever it takes to get out .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of .
you just walk away .
i do n't know how .
you could just leave him .
all this nothing ? i 've spent my life in this stinking desert . it does n't get to jake like it got to me . he does n't mind being out here . he does n't mind being nothing but a land broker . big fish in a small pond , he says . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
i 'm still here , are n't i ? see this ?
and i take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .
yeah , i guess you 're right .
i 'm guessing no .
depends on what you call love . when i was growing up i had nothing . i learned to want everything . i wanted more than sierra anyway . jake was my ticket . he 's not much ; he 's older than me , different than me , but he 's got more money than half this town put together . i courted him . i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ?
did you ever ?
no .
you love him ?
yeah , but i like the sun . i grew up on a reservation . the sun , the desert ; they were like a religion to us . jake 's the same way . he loves the desert . i guess we 're alike that way . that 's about the only way .
does n't the heat bother you ?
if he says that 's what happened , jake , it must be true .
damn it , grace ! tell him .
maybe i just want to hear you say it .
you know what i want .
that 's not an answer . what is it you want ?
still playing ?
you never did answer my question .
i 'm just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my fortune . thanks for the lemonade .
maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he 's made of .
i think i can find my own way back to into town .
really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i do n't go for being jerked around .
games ?
all right , grace . no more games .
such as ?
i have ideas .
no more drapes to hang . now what should we do ?
nothing like a little liveliness .
i like them . i was sick of looking at this room . i think they add a little life .
like they 're made of polyester .
beautiful ?
like you .
you can let go of me now . i 'm safe . how do they look .
lift me down .
what ?
there . all done . lift me down .
the same thing you do .
it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want . what is it you want ?
my face tell you all that ?
come here .
nice house for a shaman 's daughter . you must be good .
those are white words , not ours .
a medicine man ?
from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .
where 'd you learn to do that ?
a little of this , a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes .
what do you do anyway ?
i guess it must .
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house .
thank you .
nice place you got here .
good , 'cause i liked what i saw .
i guess . i 've got an ego same as any man .
did you like it ; me watching you ?
i did n't say it bothered me .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
that 's good . cools you right off . i saw you watching me .
i could n't stay in this place . i would n't . i 'd just pick up , do whatever i had to do , and get out .
somewhere else . i 've never been anywhere else . just once . years ago . went to the state fair . it was nice , but it was n't nothing .
i pack up and go somewhere else .
what happens if you lose ?
if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .
you just travel around , no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .
i do n't know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i 'll head to santa barbara . i might be able to pick up some work there .
where you headed ?
i guess i 've got wander in my blood .
you 've been around .
all over . chicago , miami , detroit . just lately albuquerque .
where you coming from ?
and here i 've made you all hot and sweaty .
not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take .
least you can leave .
yeah , my luck . i get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert .
good luck it did n't happen a few miles back . maybe they never would have found you . day like today you 'd be dead for sure .
did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
drove into sierra ? what for ?
i just drove in this morning .
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day .
why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ?
you 're not from around here , are you ?
you 're welcome , grace .
thank you , john .
i . . . ca n't . . . argue . . .
'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i do n't hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things .
yes , i have .
i saw these in the penny 's catalog , and i just knew i had to have them . you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ?
that a fact ?
i just got tired of looking at the old drapes . had them long as i can remember .
it 's nothing . really .
that 's all right . i got it .
oh , this is n't my car . it 's down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just did n't think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
was n't nothing .
no trouble at all , really .
it 's very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it 's so hot .
you should be more careful .
accident .
what happened to your hand ?
no , i 've got it .
do you want me to carry your pack for you ?
i got it .
you sure you can manage ?
jesus .
may i carry your package , grace ?
it 's grace .
my cup runneth over , beauti --
you 're pretty full of yourself , are n't you ?
maybe , but if you did n't i think you would have kept on walking .
maybe i do n't want you to .
i do n't know your real name .
do you have to call me that ?
my name is john . now i 'm not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
that 's right on my way .
i 'm just going to my car .
can i give you a hand , beautiful ?
two-hundred dollars . . . that 's how i put a price on murder .
two-hundred dollars .
you know what kind of woman grace is . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra . what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she was n't doing the same for you ? what 's she to you , jake ; a woman who would have you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
you 'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life .
think about it . how do you think i got in here ? did you hear any glass break ? did you hear a door splinter ? how did the evening end ? after you went to bed did she linger a bit ? maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked ? is that what happened ?
what are you babbling about ?
it 's not me you have to worry about . it 's her . she wants you dead , jake . she wants you dead and she wants your money .
not from where i stand .
i do n't blame you . what man would ? i admit it , okay ? i came back here and i made it with grace . but if you kill me you 're making a big mistake .
you 're right . i do n't give a damn about her . but to fuck a man 's wife behind his back ? that just makes a fool out of him . i do n't like being made a fool of .
what difference does it make if i slept with her . you do n't care about grace .
a drifter , a loner , a trouble maker like you ? just passing through town , need money so he busts in on an , old man . only this old man 's got himself an automatic , and he knows how to use it . a man 's got to protect his home . his wife . you 're dead , boy , and your own mother would n't convict me .
what are you . . . you ca n't . . . you ca n't kill me .
sense ? if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it .
you 're not talking sense .
is that what happened ? did you even make it out to the desert , or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets ?
christ , jake , please --
then maybe this afternoon . when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead .
nothing happened with me and grace this morning .
do n't jake me , boy ! it 's a big house . odd that you would know your way , except maybe you 've been in the bedroom before . maybe with grace to keep you company .
come on , jake --
this morning when i came in on you and grace , you swore you had n't so much as been near the bedroom . now you make straight for it .
wh . . . what are you talking about ?
i 'm curious about something . i 'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom 's at .
damn it , jake . if i do n't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me . and if it comes down to me or grace , then i pick grace . you were going to give me thirteen-thousand . give me two- hundred . i 'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it . but i need the money . i 've got to have the money .
that 's a lot of talk . a whole lot of talk .
yeah , well , a couple of hours ago i just about killed some guy over a girl . not for money , for a girl . and she was just going to stand there and let it happen , or let him kill me . same way grace played us this morning . i do n't like that , jake . not twice in one day . and maybe i 'm so pissed i 'd twist the next off my own grandma to get out of here .
that 's a thick change of heart .
it 's the truth , jake .
liar .
i came to kill her .
you came to take my wife from me ?
i came for grace .
there 's another reason ? it better be good .
that 's not the reason i 'm here . i swear it .
and then with jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars . or maybe two-thousand . or twenty-thousand . who 's to stop you ? not jake mckenna , 'cause old jake would be dead .
jake --
you thought you 'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham ! wail off and clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper .
wait a minute . just listen to me --
maybe you heard old jake 's got some money stashed away and you thought you 'd help yourself to a little .
it 's not like that .
fifty dollars more . that 's a lot of money when you do n't have a dime . and where 'd you plan on getting the money from ? maybe you thought you 'd pay your friend jake mckenna a visit .
he did more work on the car . he wants fifty bucks extra for it .
darrell giving you problems ?
you could say . i do n't even have it yet .
trouble with the car again ?
yeah , well , me too .
no .
maybe not this time , but somebody 's going to get dead around you .
that 's what i like about you , jake . you 're an honest man .
all i have in the world .
you think that 's a lot of money ?
thirteen-thousand dollars . had you done it . is n't that what we agreed on ?
jake , how much were you going to pay me to do the job ?
shut up !
and next time , next time somebody is going to get dead .
drop it , jake .
came close this time and it scares you .
shut up .
i hate loving her . i hate the kind of her person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays . i hate letting her use me . but i love her too much to do otherwise . and i certainly love her too much to kill her . i could n't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy .
you love her , but you hate her ?
i guess i have what you 'd call a love-hate relationship with grace .
you know so much about killing why do n't you do it yourself ?
i know all right . i know you 're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man 's wife . you 've probably bagged a few at that . you 'd probably lie , cheat and steal without thinking twice . from that you 'd just turn and walk away . but to kill ; to get that blood on your hands . you ca n't wash that off . you 'd be a marked man for life . just like cain . and you 're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints . ai n't that right , boy ?
you know what i mean .
you 're out in the desert , the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles , and you say the time was n't right ? what 's the matter ? you were hoping to get it on home video ? a keepsake for the grandkids . thank god i waited , or i never would have gotten it on tape .
the time was n't right .
you did n't kill her ?
no .
is the job done ?
i went to your place . we talked , just like you told me . we drove out into the desert . . .
and tell her what ?
this is what you do : go to the house to see her .
be quiet , boy . i 'm thinking . it ca n't be done at the house . it should be . . .
you want to do this yourself ? i do n't have to do this , you know .
how the hell should i know ? i 've never had a wife killed before . i guess i should have hired a professional .
what should i do ?
the sooner it 's over , the sooner you 're on your way . now listen to me : it 's got to look like an accident ; that 's the thing . if it does n't , then it 's no good . i wo n't get a dime , and it 's my neck that 'll be on the chopping block while you 're living it up somewhere .
i guess i might as well get this done with .
if you ca n't trust the man you 've hired to kill your wife . . . ?
do we shake hands ?
do n't say that . i had a marriage of convenience with grace , and look where that 's lead . well , looks like we got ourselves a pact .
i 'm not your boy , jake . i do n't like you , and i do n't like what you are . i got no choice but to do business with you . this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience .
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .
you 're not buying a car , for christ sake . you 're having your wife killed . i 'm the one who 's neck is stuck out . it 's thirteen , or it 's nothing .
that 's a bit much .
i need thirteen .
maybe . . . ten-thousand . and that 's a maybe .
how much could you get ?
twenty-thousand ? i do n't have that kind of money . i wo n't get the insurance until months after she 's dead . i do n't imagine you 'll want to be around after poor grace 's demise . twenty-thousand ; that 's more money than i could ever get my hands on .
make it twenty .
i put it at fifty-thousand dollars , minus your cut , of course . which is ?
how do you put a price on murder ?
just to get out of here ? that does n't seem much for a murder .
for that i 'd kill a nun on easter sunday .
and for that you 'd kill grace ?
this morning i did n't know how badly i 'd want to get out of this fucking town .
let 's say i do want her dead . what is it you want ? this morning you were n't a killer .
the slimy bastard who 's going to do it for you .
and what does that make you ?
because i think you 're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
what makes you say that ?
you meant it .
a man does n't always mean the things he says .
bullshit . you wanted me to kill her .
that was just loose talk . i do n't want anybody dead .
you 're the one who brought it up . this morning . in your car .
you 're talking like a mad man .
i 'm not rambling .
i think this heat 's getting to you the way you 're rambling on .
do n't play simple with me , jake . you want me to spell it out for you ? i 'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money .
i did ?
you said you 'd cut that up with the man who did her in .
i do .
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife . fifty-thousand dollars .
about what you said this morning .
sweet grace ? what about her ?
about things . about your wife .
talk ? about what ?
i was hoping we could talk .
now what can i do for you ?
is n't that illegal ?
i do all right . real estate is n't a bad game such as it is around here . the trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it , and overvalue when you sell . you can turn a few dollars that way .
nice office you 've got .
you just seem to attract trouble , do n't you ?
i had a problem getting my car back .
i 'm surprised to see you . i thought you 'd be halfway to vegas by now .
no .
hungry ?
no .
another accident ? you 've really got to be more careful . can i get you a drink ?
just ran into a little trouble .
good lord . what happened to you ?
this is a joke , right ? you just want to rattle me . right ?
how do you know if you 've never tried ?
i 'm not a murderer , mr. mckenna .
because i 'm sick and tired of her little games . because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again . because i 've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her , and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it .
why would i kill her ?
would you kill her ?
would i what ?
would you ?
mad like a dog in heat , i bet you were . i can tell you got a temper on you .
like you do n't know .
i bet she led you on good , did n't she ? taking you up to the house with that smile of hers . bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once . then me busting in like some wild bear . bet you had a fire going under you .
ca n't live with them , and you ca n't shoot 'em .
she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you do n't think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ? women .
that 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . do n't be offended , lad . a man who 's got no ethics is a free man . i envy you that . beside , i can hardly blame you . that grace has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? eh ?
hey !
ah , i can smell it on you .
wait a second --
it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples .
i hope so . listen , mr. mckenna , about your wife : if i had known she was married --
you a sailor man ? that 'd be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .
got work . i know a man who 's got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .
live there ?
i 've got to make a stop in vegas , then i 'm heading to santa barbara .
where you headed ?
my car overheated . i pulled in to have it fixed .
what brings you to sierra ?
john stewart .
i 'm a solid man .
jake mckenna . that 's a solid name .
i guess we 've never been introduced proper . jake mckenna .
yeah , i know . more careful .
you 've got to be --
accident .
what happened to your hand ?
is this what it 's all about ? you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you ? forget it . you want to take my head off , mister , i wo n't even try to stop you . i deserve it for being an idiot . but if you 're not , i think i 'll be on my way .
i have half a mind to --
grace , tell him .
a lot that means .
i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .
did n't much look like you were hanging drapes .
i . . i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all .
now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i 'll break you in half .
husband . . . ?
i 'm her husband .
who the hell are you ?
you stay away , jenny . i aim to mess him up , and that ai n't a thing for a woman to see .
toby ! toby tyler , leave him alone !
i said come on !
i want to stay .
stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of .
honest , toby . i just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox .
you shut your mouth , girl , and get back over to our table . now , i 'm not going to ask you again , mister . what were you doing with my girl ?
aw , toby , we were n't doing nothing . we was just talking .
i asked you a question .
get away from me !
do n't be afraid of him none . i do n't care what he does to you , we can still be together .
will you shut up !
toby tyler , it do n't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he 's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself , 'cause we love each other and we gon na run off , and i 'm gon na have his love child .
what 's your name anyway ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
you 're too late , toby . we 're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind .
no , i do n't want to take you for a ride . what i want is for . . . hey , you do n't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars i could --
eighteen . well , i 'm gon na be eighteen in two years , but that do n't mean you ca n't take me for a ride if you want .
how old are you ?
that 's what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it 's cool . want to take me for a ride ? desert 's kind of lonely this time of day .
get it through your head , little girl ; i 'm not going for you . if this toby likes you , then if i were you i 'd marry him . you 're not going to get much better in this town .
he 's not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i ai n't spoken for . not yet that is .
i was n't going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .
but you was going to fight for me .
i hate to bust your bubble , but i was n't defending you .
for defending my honor this afternoon .
for what ?
hey , mister . mister . i just . . . i just wanted to thank you .
you 're too quick for me .
you ai n't from oz . oz is in that one movie .
oz .
you 're not from around here , are you ? where you from ?
i 've had time to get over it .
gee , that 's sad . do n't that make you sad ?
she 's dead .
you like patsy cline ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she do n't put out no more new records .
how about i pick one out for you ?
that country shit all sounds the same to me .
got any requests ?
accident , and yeah , i got to be more careful .
what happened to your hand ?
i wan na play a song on the juke . you got a quarter ?
what ?
hey , mister . you got ta quarter ?
i 'm gon na beat you so bad you gon na be eatin ' nothing but soup the rest of your days . rain dogs is gon na be prettier than you when i 'm done . i 'm gon na mess you up so bad you gon na make your own momma sick . i 'm gon na . . .
nooo !
this means something to you ? jenny means something to me .
i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
mexico ? you 're going to mexico ?
give it to me !
now , what 's this ?
my honor , that 's what i 'm fighting over . now get up off the ground , or do i have to whoop you where you lie ?
you stupid punk ! you do n't even know what you 're fighting over !
i 'm doing what any man would do if he 'd been offended . i 'm beating you up .
what the hell are you doing ? are you crazy ?
get up , mister ! do n't ever let it be said toby tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance .
yeah , i know . you 're tnt . just like dynamite . when you go off somebody gets hurt . all right . let 's do this .
oh , that tears it , mister . i 'm gon na bust you up but good . i 'm gon na bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up , and then . . . and then spread them all around . that 's what i 'm gon na do . you do n't know what you 're dealing with , mister . i 'm crazy . i 'm psycho crazy .
i was n't sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?
that 's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it was n't over , but you did n't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
oh , shit !
mister !
stand up , mister , or i 'll beat you where you sit .
i was n't hitting on your girl !
stand up .
christ , i do n't believe this .
not before i settle with you .
fine . i was making time with your girl . now i 'm all scared , and i 'll never make that mistake again . now go away .
'cause i 'm just like dynamite . and when i go off somebody gets hurt .
they 're not very imaginative ?
you know who i am ? toby n. tyler . my friends call me tnt . you know why ?
you 're fucked .
what ? you want to fight ? over her ?
mister , i 'm calling you out .
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .
you expect me to believe that ?
look , pal , i was n't making a play for your girl .
make time ? is everybody in this town slap happy ?
that 's not the way it looked to me . looked to me like you was trying to make time with her .
i was n't doing anything .
hello ? hello ! ? operator , i got disconnected . hello . . .
fucking kid . and look at you ; breaking fucking pencils . you 're a neanderthal .
and john , do n't make me come look for you .
yes , mr. vesci .
do you understand me you little fuck ?
a hundred and . . . now you listen to me you deadbeat , little punk : i do n't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller . you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and i want it . i do n't care how you get it , or where from , but i want it on my desk tomorrow , or i 'll show you what real bad luck is .
a hundred-forty-five really .
let me get this straight : you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
i had to beat it before the cops showed up . i do n't have a cent to my name . i ca n't even get my car out of the garage . i tell you , mr. vesci , if it were n't for bad luck i would n't have any at all . so , i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car . i 'll pay it back with the rest of the money .
you 're the gambler . you tell me .
with a shotgun . it kills him , and it shreads the money . i mean , what are the odds ?
the old lady ?
no . he gets shot by the old lady .
let me guess . this robber ; he gets your money .
you do n't know the how , mr. vesci . and that 's not the half of it . i 've got your money , and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed .
that 's a shame , john . a real shame .
i know , mr. vesci . i know . i was on my way to you , it 's just . . . what a day i 've had . you 're not going to believe what 's happened to me . i had the money , i swear i had it . i was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere .
john , what a surprise . i expected to be seeing you , not talking to you over the phone .
and you 're taking ?
nobody 's going to hang . we 're all gon na walk away with a little something . i ai n't a greedy man . and , hell , you did all the work . one-hundred-thousand dollars . split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand . give or take .
you ai n't passing these test , son . if i ca n't trust you i 'm gon na have to arrest you . . .
thirty-thousand dollars .
what 'd you think , boy ? that you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to ? not by a long shot . you 're just the most gullible . how much did you get ?
sure you do . everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house . it 's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him . not for lack of trying .
that 's what this is all about ? a shakedown ? you picked the wrong people . we do n't have any money .
killing jake mckenna 's got to amount to something . he was n't much of a man , but that do n't give you the right to murder him . and do n't tell me you did n't , 'cause i know you did . i was there . like i said ; i been watching you .
i did n't do anything .
shut up ! the both of you . ai n't neither one of you too smart . especially you , boy . do n't you think i had my eye on you since first you rolled into town ? you smell like trouble . stink of it like a ripe cesspool .
you bitch ! you were in on it froom the start !
and as soon as i see that you 're on your way .
there 's nothing in the trunk , sheriff .
i think you might just want to do as i say .
what for ?
now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me .
sure , sheriff .
just step from the car . nice and slow .
i do n't understand what the --
why do n't you step out of the car , son ?
nope . no problems up the road .
is there a problem up the road , sheriff ?
just cool down , son . i ai n't accusing you of anything . serves toby right to get his ass whooped . if you had n't done it , somebody else would 've .
sheriff , he did n't give me any choice . if i had n't defended myself- -
suppose you 've had all you can of sierra . what with that ruckus you had with toby . oh yes , i heard all about that .
not taking a drive , sheriff . heading out of town .
nice night for a drive . morning really . i guess that 's about the only way to keep cool ; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day .
maybe not for you , sheriff , but i think i 've had my fill of your little town .
stay as long as you like , son . no rush .
wish i could help , sheriff . but if you 'll excuse me i 'm going over to harlin 's to pick up my car . then i 'm getting the hell out of this place .
that 's too bad . i was hoping you were there . maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away . or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when jamilla shot that biker .
would n't know anything about it .
there was a young man over at jamilla 's today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers .
not as bad as it looks .
just curious . that 's a nasty cut you 've got .
no , sir . and i 'm not going to be around long if that 's what you 're worried about .
saw you at the truck stop this morning . you 're not from around here .
like i said ; you really ca n't blame the boy . some people do n't know how to avoid trouble . know what i mean ?
i guess .
yep . tore him up good and spat out little , refined pieces of him . nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man .
jesus !
his father worked in a strip mine north of here . toby 's school class went up to the mine one day . school takes field trips up there every year . big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground . anyway , on this particular day toby 's dad up and falls into the machinery .
what happened ?
he is at that . no so much a fault of his own . poor boy had quite a trauma as a child .
yeah . what are you going to do ? that toby 's a hot head .
kids .
no police !
senor , you need a doctor .
no police ! wait until i 'm gone .
but , senor --
no police .
no !
i call the policia .
soda . you know .
hablar slowly , por favor . my ingles no es bien .
soda . you got any soda ?
eh ?
got any cold soda ?
you know i wo n't be seeing you .
you < u > are < /u > crazy , you know . be seeing you , old man .
things ai n't always the way they seem . you got to ask yourself : is it worth it ? day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart ! then you better know what it is you 're doing . < u > are you a human being < /u > -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin ' around ?
time 's up . any last words of wisdom ?
you got a lotta philosophy in you , old timer but you do n't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap . one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam , next it 's the joint . now it 's a woman ? i 'm hep to you .
well , do n't say i did n't warn you when things go your way .
no and i do n't plan on sticking around either .
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man 's plans . we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .
more or less .
so , we 're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they ca n't see . i ca n't see nuthin ' , so it 's all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it 's all the same to me .
you afraid of the dark ?
night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it 's when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you 're afraid of .
difference between you and me , old man , is i see the glass half full , you see it half empty .
ai n't over yet . night is part of day ; separate , but equal . night is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
your lies are old , but you tell 'em well .
i 'm a little short pops . i 'll catch you next time .
... but ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?
i got things to do .
well , people got ta get by somehow . that 's the curse . the mines done it . all that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! everybody 's got a mother . you do n't rip up your mother . you do n't rip up the earth and take everything out . it 's like the cracker jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want ... . '' ...
musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50 's . this town 's all inbreeding .
so now you 're going to tell me where i lost my eyes . you do n't think i know where i lost my eyes ? i was there when i lost them . i lost them in the war . the war in the joint . there 's always wars in the joint . cause i was a code talker in the joint and in the war too . mmmm , nothing like the smell of a naked lady . be careful , boy .
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war ?
all them miners last century . hungry ghosts , killed off all the indians . up at the mine . earth ran red with blood , think i 'm fooling around here . white sky was on fire . grown men cried like babies . i saw a flash , then darkness descended upon me . they put me in the joint . took my eyes . i cursed them . white people ca n't seem to stay away from indians . you got ta watch where ya put your fingers . pussy pussy pussy , indian pussy .
who 's cursed ?
cocksucker motherfucker ! cops . i hear you . always sneaking around . thinks i ca n't see him . well he 's right . motherfucker . but that ai n't mean i do n't know what 's going on around here . they 're all cursed . yes sir .
... and everything is nothing too .
what ?
seems like i do but only cause end of the day we 're all eyes in the same head . and everything is everything .
you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .
what do you want for free ?
i think i 've heard that before .
or maybe you just think you do . just another small town . one guy chasing you . you go big town . just gon na have four guys after you instead . kiss kissy kiss . it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? cause you got ta remember you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , that 's where you gon na be .
maybe i do .
that a fact ?
just 'cause i ai n't got eyes does n't mean i ca n't see .
you sure seen a lot for a blind man .
see . ai n't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that 's where he belongs anyways . me and jesse , that 's my dog , not anymore , but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then ... a companion that 's loyal , that 'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him ... i miss him . i 'll see ya later , unless i come across something worse .
hell no !
he 's only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him ? i ca n't take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you ?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?
i hope you was n't pettin ' him none , was you ?
oh , jesus .
that 's 'cause he 's dead .
i think you 'd better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .
christ !
do n't forget to open it for me . i ca n't be opening my own bottle .
all right , old man . christ .
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ?
yeah , sure . you got change ?
do n't be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .
i said i was sorry .
lost my eyes in vyee-et-nam . lost them fighting the commies . fought the war and lost my eyes fightin ' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me .
christ no !
i ai n't got no eyes . you want to see ?
i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes .
what 'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on ? sunnin ' myself ?
i 'm sorry , i did n't --
hell no , i ca n't do that myself . i 'm blind . ca n't you see that ?
you ca n't do that yourself ?
yeah i want something . i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop .
you want something ?
do n't call me old man . ai n't you got no respect , boy ?
you want something , old man ?
hey ! you there !
this means something to you ? jenny means something to me .
i 'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
mexico ? you going to mexico ?
give it to me !
now , what 's this ?
my honor , that 's what i 'm fighting over . now get up off the ground , or do i have to whoop you where you lie ?
you idiot ! you do n't even know what you 're fighting over !
i 'm doing what any man would do if he 'd been offended . i 'm stompin ' your ass .
yeah , i know . you 're tnt . just like dynamite . when you go off somebody gets hurt . all right . let 's do this .
oh , that tears it , mister . i 'm gon na bust you up but good . i 'm gon na bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up , and then ... and then spread them all around . that 's what i 'm gon na do . you do n't know what you 're dealing with , mister . i 'm crazy . i 'm psycho crazy .
i was n't sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?
that 's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it was n't over , but you did n't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
oh , shit !
mister !
stand up , mister , or i 'll beat you where you sit .
i was n't hitting on your girl !
stand up .
christ , i do n't believe this !
not before i settle with you , chickenshit !
fine . i was making time with your girl . now i 'm scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?
'cause i 'm just like dynamite . and when i go off , somebody gets hurt .
let 's see ... they 're not very imaginative ?
what ? you want to fight ? over her ?
mister , i 'm calling you out .
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .
you expect me to believe that ?
then maybe you should 've . look , pal , i was n't making a play for your girl .
make time ? is everybody in this town on drugs ?
that 's not the way it looked to me . looked to me like you was trying to make time with her .
i was n't doing anything .
two-hundred dollars ... i 'll do it ! i 'll kill her !
two-hundred dollars ?
you know what kind of woman grace is , jake . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior . what 's she to you , jake ; a woman who wants you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
you 'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life .
do n't jake me boy ! it 's a big house . you probably did n't even make it out to the desert this afternoon ...
come on , jake --
what are you talking about !
how the hell did you know where the bedroom 's at ?
damn it , jake . there is a guy coming to kill me , and if it comes down to me or grace , then i pick grace . you were going to give me thirteen-thousand . give me two-hundred . i 'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it . she showed me the perfect place . there wo n't be enough left for an autopsy . but i need the the money . i 've got to have the money .
you have a lot of talk in you , whole lot of talk .
maybe i do n't like being played , like she played us today . maybe i do n't like that at all , jake . i 'm just pissed enough , maybe i 'll rip the neck off my own grandmother .
that 's a thick change of heart from this afternoon .
it 's the truth , jake .
shhh ! liar .
you came to take my wife from me ?
i came for grace .
... and he thought he 'd clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper ... and then maybe borrow $ 200 or $ 20,000 , or $ 200,000 ...
wait a minute . just listen to me ...
no , but it do n't matter anyway when you 're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i 'm telling sheriff potter about this drifter , did n't have enough money to fix his car . and darrell happened to find his gun , and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away , and figgered he might try to break in and steal it !
it 's not what you think , jake .
i guess this is what they call `` ironee '' ? hunh ?
i like darrell . he may be an idiot , but he 's my half brother . we own harlin 's together , yeah , that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out .
that 's my gun ... that fucking darrell !
no !
next time you 'll do just fine .
i know you 're not surprised i 'm back here , cause you can read my mind and all .
... i do n't know . tell her you had to see her . tell her you do n't care if she 's married or not , you had to be with her . sweet talk the woman . a young buck like you must be good at that . then ... maybe shift the conversation . get her thinking about that jeep of hers . she loves that thing . maybe the only thing she does love . she 'll want to take you for a ride .
and tell her what ?
oh yeah sure . why do n't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i 'm at it . i < u > know you < /u > ... this is what you do : go to the house to see her .
come to think of it , how 'bout some money upfront ?
be quiet , boy . i got to figure this thing . i 'm thinking . it ca n't be done at the house . it should be ...
you want to do this yourself ? i do n't have to do this , you know .
how the hell should i know ? i 've never had a wife killed before . jesus christ ! < u > you < /u > want this job , you do n't know how to do this ? i guess i should have hired a professional .
how do you want it ?
if you ca n't trust the man you 've hired to kill your wife ... ? the thing is it 's got to look like an accident ; that 's the thing . if it does n't , then it 's no good . i wo n't get a dime , and it 's my neck that 'll be on the chopping block while you 're living it up somewhere .
do n't say that . i had a marriage of convenience with grace , and look where that 's lead ... well , looks like we got ourselves a contract .
i 'm not your boy . i do n't like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . let 's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .
we 're not talking about buying a car jake . we 're talking about killing your wife . it 's thirteen , or it 's nothing .
that 's a bit much .
i need thirteen .
maybe ... ten-thousand . and that 's a maybe .
how much could you get ?
no , i hate loving her . i hate the kind of person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little `` games '' she plays . like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me . the bitch . she loved to play . she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it . she tortures me . but she 's family . she 's my little girl . my baby . i could n't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . no . not me . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy ... how much you want ?
you love her , but you hate her ?
well , i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with grace .
the slimy bastard who 's going to do it for you ... you 're a jealous man jake . if you ca n't have grace to yourself ... well , you 're not the sharing kind .
and what does that make you ?
because you 're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
what makes you say that ?
you meant it .
a man does n't always mean the things he says .
bullshit . you wanted me to kill her .
oh , that was just loose talk . husband gettin ' pissed off . i do n't want anybody dead .
well then , i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town . you 're the one brought it up . this morning . in your car .
you 're talking like a madman .
i 'm not rambling .
boy i think this heat 's getting to you the way you 're rambling on .
do n't play simple with me , jake . you 're a betting man . you want me to spell it out for you ? i 'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money .
i did ?
you said you 'd cut that up with the man who did her in .
i do .
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife . fifty-thousand dollars .
about what you said this morning .
sweet grace ? what about her ?
about things . about your wife .
talk ? about what ?
i was hoping we could talk .
what can i do for you , lad ?
this is a joke , right ? you just want to rattle me . right ?
how do you know if you 've never tried ?
i 've done a few things but i 'm not a murderer , mr. mckenna .
would you kill her ?
would i what ?
would you ?
mad like a dog in heat , i bet you were . i can tell you got a temper on you .
like you do n't know .
`` you ca n't shoot 'em ! '' i like that . i bet she led you on good , did n't she ? taking you up to the house to hang drapes . oh that 's a good one . bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face . i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . then me busting in like some wild bear . ha ! bet you had a fire going under you .
ca n't live with them , and you ca n't shoot 'em .
she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you do n't think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ? women .
that 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . do n't be offended , lad . a man who 's got no ethics is a free man . i envy that . beside , how can i blame you ? that grace sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? eh ?
hey !
ah , i can smell it on you .
wait a second --
it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples .
i hope so . listen , mckenna about your wife : if i had known she was married --
you a sailor man ? that 'd be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .
got work . i know a man who 's got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .
live there ?
california ...
darrell 's a moron .
oh ? darrell taking good care of you ?
an overheated car .
`` bobby cooper . '' what brings you to superior , coop ?
bobby cooper .
i 'm a solid man .
that 's a solid name .
i guess we 've never been introduced proper . jake mckenna .
yeah , i know . more careful .
you 've got to be --
accident .
say , what happened to your hand ?
yeah ...
after you huffed off , grace lied so bad , i got so pissed off , i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead . sorry i lost my cool like that . it 's a funny thing , women .
i 'll give you a lift , son . too hot to be walking ... people die out here , y'know .
what the fuck do you want ?
it ai n't broke .
you broke my nose !
you ca n't just walk in here and walk out , you sonufabitch ! i 'm gon na tear you a new asshole !
grace , tell him .
a lot that means .
i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .
did n't much look like you were hanging drapes .
easy , chief . i ... i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all .
now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i 'll break you in half .
i 'm her husband .
who the hell are you ?
who the hell is this ! ?
get away from me !
do n't be afraid of him none . i do n't care what he does to you , we can still be together .
will you shut up !
toby tucker , it do n't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he 's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself , 'cause we love each other and we gon na run off , and i 'm gon na have his love child .
what 's your name anyway ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
you 're too late , toby . we 're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind .
no , i do n't want to take you for a ride . what i want is for ... hey , you do n't think you can get $ 150 from your parents , could you ?
eighteen ... well , i 'm gon na be eighteen in two years , but that do n't mean you ca n't take me for a ride if you want .
how old are you ?
that 's what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it 's a cool car . want to take me for a ride ? desert 's kind of lonely this time of day .
get it through your head , little girl ; i 'm not going for you . if this toby likes you , then if i were you i 'd marry him . you 're not going to get much better in this town .
he 's not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i ai n't spoken for . not yet that is .
i was n't going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .
but you was going to fight for me .
i hate to bust your bubble honey , but i was n't defending you .
for defending my honor this afternoon .
for what ?
hey mister . mister , i just ... i just wanted to thank you .
you 're too quick for me .

yeah , like al capone on tax day . get the keys ?
i do n't want no dirty money . i run an honest business .
that 's none of your business . get the keys .
two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills . and this morning you was broke .
you got the money ?
i want my car .
what the hell ... oh , it 's you . might 've figgered . listen i got a waitress coming over . what do you want ?
we 're closed . come back when the sun comes up .
open up !
what you want ?
when i work on a car , i work on a car .
and you had to go into the trunk , did n't you ?
well , that key 's not gon na work . i had to pop the lock . you did n't leave me the trunk key .
what the fuck did you do to my trunk ?
darrell . i 'll get you your money . i just have to get something out of the trunk .
darrell .
look , harlin .
what 's the matter ? the fight gone out of you ? i 'm just gon na smash a headlight . maybe two .
no ! okay ! okay !
listen to me you sorry sonufabitch . you owe me money , and this car ai n't going nowheres until i get it . and if you take another five hours i 'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it . is that clear ? now get out of here 'fore i call the sheriff , < u > who knows me < /u > .
listen you stupid fuck , i want my car .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .
what reputation ? you 're nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumbleweed hick .
the goddamn sign on the wall . i ca n't do unauthorized work ? what am i suppose to do ? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .
what sign ?
well , now , you just know all there is about bein ' a mechanic , do n't you ? did n't you read the sign .
i do n't give a fuck ! i did n't tell you to do it ! you ca n't just do unauthorized work .
yeah , but it was shot .
i did n't tell you to replace any gasket .
yep . for the hose . but while you was gone i replaced a gasket . that 's going to run you another fifty .
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty .
it 's going to cost you two-hundred dollars .
what ?
two-hundred .
listen , darrell , about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i 'm going i swear i 'll --
no charge .
that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .
you think bad , and bad is what you get .
you believe that ?
hell , i 've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . ai n't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out .
you 've been there ?
one of those days you feel like you been runnin ' in circles and you ai n't no closer to where you tryin ' to get than when you started ?
yeah , well , i 've been around the bend a bit .
hey there . i was beginnin ' to think you was n't comin ' back ... you do n't look so good .
i want my hundred and forty-five dollars .
what sign ? fuck the sign . i want my car .
you ai n't got no credit card but you got a lawyer . sweet talk me all you want . did n't you read the sign ? it says ...
you son of a bitch ! i 'll have my lawyers shut you down .
... got no day , got no date . probably ai n't worth a duck 's fart . this one here cost me $ 3.75 and it 's got every doodad you can imagine . no sir i 'll stick with this .
now that 's too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you 're gon na have to work this one off .
i do n't have a goddamn credit card .
then you 're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole . you can keep that dollar . now why do n't you just take your american express gold card , and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split .
listen , man . i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had .
then you ai n't gon na have the car .
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i do n't have the money .
i do n't know , but `` it 's the reason i 'm living here and you 're just passing through . '' now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?
`` that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . ''
that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?
actually , it 's been about three hours . you 're the one thinks that car 's so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?
about an hour and a half , because that 's all the longer i 've been gone .
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
to replace a goddamn radiator hose ! ?
hundred-fifty .
how much ! ?
well ... you got your parts , you got your labour ... let 's call it a hundred-fifty bucks .
bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now .
what the hell happened to my car ?
another accident ? you got to be more careful .
just banged my head . it was an accident .
do n't look like nothing .
nothing .
hey , your ... what the hell happened to you ?
hey .
i 'll be back in a couple of hours . and be careful with her , will you ?
diner up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
i 'm very interested in this but is there someplace ...
you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i do n't know if you can still see it , but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower .
accident .
ninety-two . course half hour from now might be seventy-two . these clouds move around a lot .
jesus . twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already .
twenty-after-ten .
time .
how much time ?
got ta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one , or close enough . gon na take time .
great !
yeah , i can fix it .
okay , i 'm stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?
somewhere else ? mister , somewhere else is fifty miles from here . only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut ...
if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?
well , you know so much why do n't you just fix it yourself ?
i know it 's busted . what did i just tell you ?
it 's your radiator hose . it 's busted .
so ?
ok. darrell ... could you just take a look at my radiator hose . it 's busted .
darrell --
look , harlin , i 've got places to be .
damn . gon na be another hot one today . sometimes i do n't even want to get out of bed . course do n't want to get out for the cold one 's neither . then of course the clouds come in ...
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --
so ?
but he 's dead .
'cause harlin used to own it .
then why do you call it harlin 's ?
yep .
you own this place ?
doubt it . he 's dead . the look out 's a cemetery .
will he be back soon ?
he 's up at the look out .
harlin around ?
nope . darrell .
you harlin ?
no ! no police .
i call the sheriff .
soda . you know .
hablar slowly , por favor . my ingles no es bien .
soda . you got any soda ?
eh ?
got any cold soda ?
he < u > ca n't < /u > help you now , honey !
< u > jake < /u > ...
and love 's a funny thing . sometimes i do n't know if i want to love you ...
and i love you too .
'cause i love you .
why 's that ?
grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope . it should reach down here . go get it , throw it down .
can you make it back up ?
i busted my leg !
bobby ? are you all right ?
thank you . thank you . i ... i knew you would n't leave me , grace .
but we all need that too . hold him .
hope is a four-letter word .
save the mom routine , will ya grace . it does n't work with me . one , two , three ...
my mother died in this canyon .
time to go for a walk , jake .
i think you 're a lying , back-stabbing psycho bitch , and one day you 'll kill me . but it 's nice to know you cared ...
i do n't want to go to mexico , bobby ! please , i really want to be with you . do n't blow this . do n't you think i care about you ?
when you 're finished with me , i 'm next ! i been there , baby . i been there with other cunts ... sorry , not anymore . i 'll take you as far as california . if we can make that . after that you 're on your own . try mexico . with all this bread , you can live like a queen .
you lied to me all along ! lies , all lies . your mother , your father , what story are you on now ? how come the town did n't know you was his daughter ?
i was just baiting him ! bobby , i had to tell him that to get his guard down . just like you told jake you was going to kill me !
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again ?
do n't leave me . i want to say with you , bobby .
well , nothing . we dump jake , we split the money , then you 're on your own .
i believe in this moment , that 's all . there is nothing else . come on . he must weigh 300 pounds .
you do n't believe in anything do you , bobby ?
i think nothing happens . you 're dead meat . that 's it .
you could give me my gun back .
do n't you think i would 've done it if i wanted to ? what can i do to make you relax , baby ?
you think now that jake 's dead , there 's all that money there and i do n't need you anymore , and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and ... pop !
no grace , my hand 's bothering me .
< u > i do n't know why < /u > !
why ?
do n't you really want to know ? was jake my daddy ? was i fucking my own daddy ? do n't you want to know that ?
let it go , baby . it 's the past . i got a past ...
do n't you want to know ... ? i bet it 's burning a hole in your brain just now ?
ask you what ? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next ?
so , are n't you going to ask me ?
he was a scumbag ! ... he wanted < u > me < /u > , bobby . these guys do n't let go ! even when they 're < u > dead < /u > ... you do n't know what it was like , bobby . those two , they were the same .
he was a < u > cop < /u > , grace , they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop ...
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake 's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life ... no thanks .
he was in love with you grace . he would 've done what you wanted , you could 've made a deal and ...
get real bobby . he was gon na kill you < u > and < /u > me .
what are you talking about ?
you know i thought you 'd left me back there .
you already have .
hawaii . i 've read all about it . i 've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet . oh , god . i 'd kill to go there .
what the hell ? why not ? where should we go ?
anywhere ?
we 're going to buy a boat of our own baby , and sail it wherever we want to go .
but i thought --
i 'm not sailing his boat .
then will you take me on your friends ' boat with you ?
i want a place where only the vultures will find him ... it 'll be over soon , grace .
ca n't we just dump him fast someplace ?
we 've still got some dead weight to get rid of .
you spent a day in superior . i wasted my entire life there . i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders .
i do n't know about that ?
you do n't know what it feels like to be free of that place .
hey ! take it easy . want to get us killed ?
it should be just up ahead . hold on ... there ! there it is !
i ca n't see it .
i 'm not coming back .
good thinking . what 's all this ?
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . people 'll think maybe me and jake went away . buy us some time ... i know a back road we can take .
i ... nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . hurt like hell .
bobby ? what the hell 's the matter with you ?
no ! you get it !
the money 's right here ! get the key !
after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .
grace ... grace ?
we do n't have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away . it was your idea , remember ? i 'm doing this for you . i 'm doing this so you can fly ... fly like a bird .
you said you could n't kill anybody .
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you 're what i want . the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake . but i 've had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we 've got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
are you sure ? ... about me , i mean ?
i do n't give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there 's only one way to do that .
is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
i could if i had jake 's money .
i thought you could n't get your car .
i mean it , grace . i 'm getting out of here , and i want to take you with me .
because i know you 're full of shit .
why ? am i making you hot , or does the truth scare you ?
stop it .
except i ca n't get you out of my head , grace .
there is no us , remember ?
what about us ?
i do n't think we have anything to talk about .
i wanted to talk .
it 's not like he 's a young man , bobby . he 's had time to live . it 'd be quick . i mean , he would n't even have to < u > feel < /u > it ... i mean , sometime in the middle of the night , when it 's quiet ... when he 's asleep , you could just come up behind him when he 's pounding on me and ...
i ca n't kill , grace . i ca n't kill anybody .
kill him .
if the key 's on him , how do we get the key ?
it takes a key . he keeps it on himself all the time . i mean < u > all the time < /u > . it scratches up against me when we do it .
one-hundred-thousand ! ? that son-of-a-bitch .
oh yeah . there 's nothing else with jake . he do n't trust banks . he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed . he loves it so much , he would n't think of spending any of it on me . i never seen it but i know he 's got more than a hunnert thousand at least ...
in < u > cash < /u > ?
at night . he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . i heard him . my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there . maybe more .
what do you mean ?
jake hides it . in a safe . in the floor . in the bedroom . he counts it . he loves to sit there and count it .
where ?
... you could get me money . i 'll get you out of here .
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he do n't want me goin ' anywhere ...
you do n't have any money put away , do you ?
darrell ? you know he and jake are ...
honey , baby , i < u > ca n't < /u > . i ca n't even get out of here < u > myself < /u > . believe it or not , i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic ...
please . i wo n't hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i do n't care . i just want to get out of here .
oh yeah . it 's beautiful , beautiful beaches . blue water and clear skies as far as you can see .
is it pretty ?
oh yeah . it 's far , it 's another world .
yeah .
yeah . what do you want . life , right ? have you ever been to california ?
i 'm sorry ...
after he got his divorce , he forced me to marry him ... but when i saw her body , i swore to her on my soul that some day i 'd get jake for what he did to her ...
you 're sick too ... he loved to do things to me . control me . my mom ... it tore her up cause she could n't do nothing about it . she become alcoholic ... and the funny thing is -- i liked it . i liked being controlled by jake . the truth was as far out and crazy as he got , i wanted < u > more < /u > . i wanted to go all the way . women say they do n't want to be taken like , < u > really taken < /u > -- that 's bullshit -- they do . the first time he finished with me , he said i was a woman now . i was 14. then he started crying like a baby ... wanted me to hold him . it 's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years , but still want to hold him , comfort him ... they found my mom right down there at the bottom of apache leap . she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil ... sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane . but i 'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident . she was born on this earth and she loved it . she was like me . she just wanted to fly away .
yeah .
he < u > was < /u > a shaman ... in the mine . we had nothin ' after he died . jake took us in , gave us a little money . he used to call me his `` little halfbreed '' ... he kept mom on the side y'know , cause he was married someplace else . he had kids in phoenix i think , no one knew him around here ... but the thing was ... you see ... ... he was raping me the whole time ... for years . he loved to do things to me . believe it or not , he used to say he was in love with my ass . y'ever been in love with a woman 's ass ?
you mean the shaman ?
nothing i understand better than a mess .
it 's just such a mess . with jake i mean ...
try me .
you 'd never understand .
grace , i 've been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you 're becoming the queen of hot and cold .
get out of town , bobby , as quick as you can .
do n't feel like nothing .
nothing .
what 's the matter ? ... grace ?
is that so bad ? it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy . for awhile , anyway . i mean , i would ... do things for him . i guess i 'm no good that way . i guess i tried to sucker you along like that . do you hate me for it ? i would n't blame you if you did . but maybe it 's like you said : you just got to do whatever it takes to get out .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of .
walk away .
i do n't know how .
you could leave him .
all this nothing ? it does n't get to jake like it gets to me . he says he do n't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
i 'm still here , are n't i ? see this ?
i take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .
yeah , i guess you 're right .
i 'm guessing no .
i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ?
is that why you 're with him ?
depends on what you call love . i grew up on a reservation . a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . that 's where they stick indians , bobby . that 's where they leave us to die . my brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he could n't take it anymore . there 's no hope there ... jake was my ticket out . mom and me .
did you ever ?
no .
you love him ?
yeah , but i like the sun . i grew up on a reservation . the sun , the desert ; they like a religion to us . jake 's the same way . he loves the desert . i guess we 're alike that way . that 's about the only way .
does n't the isolation bother you ?
they hear you comin ' . they wo n't bother you . just do n't sneak up on 'em .
are there snakes out here ?
guys like me take those chances . let 's go .
how do you know he 's still not here ?
yeah , well i said i was an idiot . whatta you say we get out of here , take a drive somewhere , talk ...
maybe i just want to hear you say it .
you know what i want .
that 's not an answer . what is it you want ?
still playing ?
you never did answer my question .
i 'm just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my mind , remember ? thanks for the lemonade .
maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he 's made of .
i think i can find my own way back to into town .
really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i do n't go for being jerked around .
and what would that be ?
i have an idea .
no more drapes to hang . now what should we do ?
nothing like a little liveliness .
i like them . i was sick of looking at this room . i think they add a little life .
beautiful ?
like you .
you can let go of me now . i 'm safe . how do they look ?
lift me down .
what ?
there . all done . lift me down .
the same thing you do .
it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want . what is it you want ?
my face tell you all that ?
come here .
nice house for a shaman 's daughter . you must be good .
those are white words , not ours .
a medicine man ?
from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .
where 'd you learn to do that ?
a little of this , a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes .
what do you do anyway ?
i guess it must .
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house .
thank you .
nice place .
good , 'cause i liked what i saw .
i guess . i 've got an ego same as any man .
did you like it ; me watching you ?
i did n't say it bothered me .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to .
that 's good . cools you right off . i saw you watching me .
i pack up and go somewhere else .
what happens when you lose ?
if you 're going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .
i never played tennis . you just travel around bobby -- no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .
cooper . bobby cooper . oh you know , whatever pays best . little bartending , used to teach tennis , played a little competition ... .
so , what is it you do , mister ... ?
i do n't know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i 'll head to santa barbara . i might be able to pick up some action there .
where you headed ?
i guess i 've got wander in my blood .
you 've been around .
all over . chicago , houston , detroit . just lately dallas .
where you coming from ?
and here i 've made you all hot and sweaty .
not until my car 's fixed . i do n't know how long that 's going to take .
you 're lucky you did n't break down in the desert . day like today , you 'd be dead in no time . when you leaving ?
did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
drove into superior ? what for ?
i just drove in this morning .
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day .
why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ?
you 're not from around here , are you ?
you 're welcome , grace .
thank you , bobby .
that 's all right . i got it .
oh , this is n't my car . it 's down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just did n't think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
was n't nothing .
no trouble at all , really .
it 's very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it 's so hot .
you should be more careful .
accident .
what happened to your hand ?
no , i 've got it .
do you want me to carry your pack for you ?
i got it .
you sure you can manage ?
jesus .
may i carry your package , grace ?
it 's grace .
i like that about me , beautiful .
you 're pretty full of yourself , are n't you ?
maybe , but if you did n't i think you would have kept on walking .
maybe i do n't want you to .
i do n't know your real name .
do you have to call me that ?
my name is bobby . now i 'm not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
that 's right on my way .
i 'm just going to my car ?
can i give you a hand , beautiful ?
sounds like it . i wish i could help sheriff , but i just want to get my car and get on up the road .
there was a young fellow over at jamilla 's today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .
yeah , fell down and hit a rock . not as bad as it looks .
that 's a nasty cut you got there .
no , sir . i 'm not going to be around long if that 's what you 're worried about .
seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today . you 're not planning on staying are you ?
get in .
harlin 's .
where ya goin ' ?
son . little excitement out at the reservation this morning . wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun . bia handled it . i went by for backup .
morning , officer .
shit i 'm sorry ! ... you ca n't believe the strain i 'm under . i 'm just under a lot of strain here .
what 'd you say to me !
a hundred and ... now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk : i do n't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller . you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and < u > i want it < /u > . i do n't care how you get it , or where from , but i want it on my desk tomorrow , or i 'll show you what real bad luck is .
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .
... now , let me get this straight . two years you give me problems with your fuckin ' payoffs . now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
yeah , if you could send it care of ...
but which i can get . no problem . look , i can sell my car in vegas . blue book it 's worth 16 at least . i just need the 150 , uh ...
which you do n't have .
mr. arkady , honest , i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed . so now i do n't have a cent to my name . i ca n't even get my car out of the garage . i tell you , mister ... if it were n't for bad luck i would n't have nay fuckin ' luck at all , you know ? so , i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car out of this garage , see ? the bus depot here has a western union thing . and of course i 'll pay it back with the rest of the money .
with a < u > shotgun < /u > ! she kills < u > both < /u > of 'em , and ... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces . not one bill is left alive . i mean , what are the odds ?
the old lady ?
no . two of them . two robbers . and they < u > both < /u > get nailed ... get shot by the old lady .
... and let me guess . this robber -- he gets your money .
right , mr. arkady . and that 's not the half of it . i got your money , and i go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then ... well , it gets < u > robbed < /u > !
`` arkady ''
and that 's not the half of it , mr. arkadin ...
that 's a shame , bobby . a real shame .
i 'm sorry . it 's just ... you know ...
keep your change . bus three-twenty-three . leaves at seven fifty two , tonight .
the ticket is 30.55 .
twenty-seven , fifty . that 's all i got .
30.55. twenty more will get you back .
one way .
one way , or round trip ?
how much ?
how about ciudad juarez ? you could take a local , arrives in two hours , and transfer in albuquerque . it 'll get you across the border .
i do n't care , just get me there .
mexico is a large country . where in mexico would you like --
i ... mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that 's where i have to go .
but , in particular ?
out of here .
where to ?
i need a ticket .

shasta ! now why 'd you go and scare the nice man like that ? sorry about that , mister . let 's see , you want $ 3.25 . you try to have a nice day now , would you ?

son of a bitch !
flo , i 'm just gon na help myself to a refill on the coffee .
let me get your change .
more like jenny is after every man she sees .

what was that all about ?
my lord , that little baby of yours virgil , has gotten cuter'n a bunny 's nose .
... but i bet the story she < u > did n't < /u > tell you was the best story of all . how old crazy jake < u > was really her papa < /u > . and she < u > liked < /u > fucking papa ! and now she 's killed the sonufabitch ! just like she 's gon na kill you !

shhhh ! just like your mama , always scared of things ...
jake , do n't go out there . call the sheriff .
there 's someone in the house .

you did n't hear something ?
what 's the matter ?
no ! no ! please !
you broke her heart ! you broke your mama 's heart . you stole me ! that 's right . fuck it away . but it ai n't ever goin ' away , cause your mama -- she 's like a hungry ghost baby , she wo n't go away , she wo n't leave ya alone .

nothing , jake . absolutely nothing .
what the hell you looking at , girl ?
i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .
they look nice .
you have n't even looked at them once .
they look nice .
you never said anything . about the drapes .
i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
i put up new drapes , jake .
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . do n't you , grace ?
wrong number .
who was that on the phone ?
you stay away , jenny . i aim to mess him up , and that ai n't a thing for a woman to see .
toby ! toby tucker , leave him alone !
i said come on !
i want to stay .
stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of . i ai n't never taken no drugs , mister , and ...
honest , toby . i just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox .
you shut your mouth , girl , and get back over to our table . now , i 'm not going to axe you again , mister . what were you doing with my girl ?
aw , toby , we were n't doing nothing . we was just talking .
i axed you a question .
i want my lawyer !
get out of the car , spread them . you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to < u > shut the fuck up < /u > ! you commie motherfucker . either way you 're goin ' to the can .
what fuckin grocery store , you fucking shithead idiot ! you call yourself a police ...
what 's that ? ... '' concealed '' is a definite no no in this town , ivan . you know anything about jamilla 's grocery store ?
what ? you trying to bribe me , mister ? just cause you russians ai n't commies anymore , do n't think money can buy everything ...
i am russian , da ! i am also < u > rich < /u > russian , da ? maybe we work something out , my friend sheriff ?
whoa , what kind of accent you got there ? you one of them russians ?
vat ? i am going 5 miles an hour ! i am looking town . i not even moving .
where 's the fire sweetheart ? do n't know how they work things in nevada , but we got speed limits in this state .
yes .
is that the entire message ?
ask if he can check how many sick days i 've taken since i 've worked here ?
proceed .
i had to put him down .
wow .
i was in an accident once too . a horse almost trampled me to death .
oh .
no sir he is not . i read about you in the paper .
is noel in ?
yes ?
i have a lock on the door .
what about jeb ?
i 'll keep it in my office room .
i 'm listening .
do you see any telletubbies around here ? ... do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? ... do you see a little asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it ? ... no ? ... well that 's what you see at a toy store ? any you must think this is a toy store , cause you 're in here shopping for an infant named jeb . one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person 's valuable time ...
what did i say ?
no , no , no , no no ... you need to go now .
no .
four .
how old is jeb ?
my son jeb . it 's a gift for him .
once again please ?
you 've made a considerably wise decision .
wrap it up .
it 's like you resent us david . resent the life you have .
i do n't know megan .
why ?
that counts .
i had a nightmare one night and i did n't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . i think that was the first time . does that count ?
maybe it was n't a specific moment , maybe it --
it 's finished . i won .
what about the game ?
think carefully ?
i 'm not sure .
my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?
soft and wet . that 's very interesting .
we 're supposed to be honest .
what was that ?
soft and wet , by the artist formerly known as prince .
my turn . what 's your favorite song ?
i did n't know that . mine 's still brown .
as a color , not as rust . you know , a rust colored paint or wood ?
rust ?
... i think rust .
jeremy what the hell are you doing ?
he did n't do anything . he just told me his theory ... it 's sad when patients get like that . they loose reality .
jesus .
oh . elijah price came to visit me at the center today .
out again ?
yes .
would you like to try going --
he 's dealing with a lot of things . i think he needs to find answers himself .
he 's just laying in bed . he 's pretty upset . he wo n't talk .
you use your sleeve .
what do i do when i 'm around someone i know ?
not often , but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they do n't know how long the shadow really is . they do n't know how far away the real limits are standing ... they stop out of fear .
... when you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or two ? do something they did n't know they were capable of ?
i was hoping you would call me , but ... anyway i decided not to wait . i was thinking , it might be nice to go to dinner together .
i remember you .
my name is megan inverso . we went to college together .
yeah ? megan where are you calling from ?
yes . is this david ?
megan ?
oh .
i 've come to a decision .
matching shirt and shorts . it was brutal .
oh shit ...
the mitchell barbecue three years ago .
when was the last time i wore pink ?
no that 's it .
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while i 'm up ? ... when was the last time you wore pink ? when was the last time you drank soup standing up ? final call for strange questions at two in the morning .
yes .
is that what you wanted to ask me ?
it means we 're probably to tired to remember .
that 's strange is n't it ? not remembering one fever ... or a cold ... or a sore throat . what do you think that means ?
... i ca n't remember .
megan , do you ever remember me getting sick ?
not a specific day . what 's this about ?
do you remember me getting sick ?
okay .
i have n't been sick this year . i know that .
i do n't know . it 's been a while .
oh .
he 's asleep .
is jeremy okay ?
i know .
i do n't want to drag this out too long for jeremy .
i 'm still going to new york . just not this second .
what does that mean ?
i do n't think i got the job in new york .
no . and i have been sick . i spent a week in a hospital when i was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning . two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool . they were dunking me . i swallowed water . they did n't know it and they almost killed me . heroes do n't get killed like that . normal people do .
are you finished ?
you have a problem , elijah . my wife is right . somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it .
i never said you could n't be killed . i never said that .
stop messing with my life elijah . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right .
that 's not what i witnessed david .
i must have felt some lump in his back when i bumped him . most guns have a black or silver handle . i had a fifty-fifty shot at the color .
the car accident you were in ... was there anyone else involved ?
quick .
one last question .
i have to go now .
or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants .
the guy might not have been carrying anything .
it 's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they 've done something wrong ... or the level of what they 've done wrong .
okay , i do n't want to play this game anymore .
characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
listen . i got to be on the sidelines during the game ... you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at --
you 're skill .
i do n't know what you 're asking ?
have you ever tried to develop it ?
yes .
telling when people have done something wrong ?
like what ?
you have good instincts when it comes to things like that ?
i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t.v .
but not a knife ?
i thought he was carrying something .
you thought he was carrying a knife ?
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .
how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
i got you a seat in the seven hundred level . it 's nose-bleed territory , but at least you wo n't get spit on .
that guy in green . sometimes people carry weapons in here . then they drink too much . they 're team is n't doing so well , bad things happen ... we do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying . if he 's carrying , he 'll step out of line .
is there a problem ?
just give me a minute .
you could have poured coffee in starbucks , you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings , you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet ... you could have been one of ten thousand things ... but in the end , you chose to protect people . you made that decision ... and i find that very , very interesting . now all i need is your credit card number .
are you for real ?
why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world ... you chose protection ?
we 've already begun .
we 're not proceeding anywhere together .
not money . but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution .
what do you want ?
i 've come to understand that ... an ill advised purchase in the parking lot .
it 's for last week 's game .
i see guys like you all the time in my work . you find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story , utterly convincing ... and somewhere in there , you slip it in ... 'i just need your credit card number ' , 'i just need a small down payment . '
you 've misunderstood .
what 's this about ? this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ?
technically no . i gambled that you would attend the church service . i just waited for you .
at the church ... you were following me were n't you ?
what was your idea elijah ?
this city has had its share of disasters . well publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as i waited and watched the news over the years ... and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed . and just like that , an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality .
the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head .
you forgot the `` now i 'm going to tell you what the hell is going on '' step . see usually that comes before the , `` it 's over '' step . and it always , always comes before the `` you can go '' step . what is over ?
you assumed wrong .
i assumed because of the train .
was it serious ?
in college . a car accident .
what 's he talking about ?
your answer to my question . it 's one thing to have never been injured in your life , but to state that you 've never taken ill , well that 's a whole new level .
skeptical about what ?
seventy-five percent ? that 's not nearly good enough for me . i 'm extremely skeptical .
seventy-five percent .
how certain are you that you have n't been sick in your life ?
i do n't know for sure . ... i do n't think so .
you 've never been sick ?
yes he is .
he 's kind of a miracle .
i 'm very proud of him . he 's been through a lot in his life . a lot of ups and downs , a lot of bad spells . a couple i 'd thought had broken him ... i mean emotionally . they were bad ... but he made it . yes he did .
he 's doing well today .
we are .
he 's spoken of you . he says you 're becoming friends .
it 's a pleasure to meet you . i 'm david dunne .
i am . i 'm helping him with the sale .
just now . they want you to come down to his school .
when ?
there 's a message for you at the office . your kid was hurt .
yeah ?
consider him packed . i did n't like his attitude ... struttin around with a cane and shit .
send him packing . i 'm not walking all the way over there .
he 's got the most beautiful eyes ... the hell kind of question is that ? he 's a guy .
what 's he look like ?
dunne , it 's jenkins , we got a guy at gate 17c with a bogus ticket . says he knows you . he wo n't tell me his name .
jeremy if you pull that trigger i 'm going to leave ! i 'm going to go to new york .
do n't be scared .
jeremy listen to what --
i 'll just shoot him once .
i 'm not . i just did n't connect it .
you 're lying .
that was me they were talking about . i almost died . that was me .
elijah was wrong .
you wo n't get hurt ...
you 're secret identity . that man was right .
know what ?
i know now .
do you know why ?
that 's great .
i 'm not scared .
i see .
i 'm sleeping in my room .
there 's no more left ?
all of it .
how many did you put on that time ?
get mom .
what do you do if something happens ?
two hundred and seventy .
how much is it ?
i lied .
how much did you take off ?
what if he was n't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him ?
no jeremy .
i mean if you knew karate ?
no .
how much can you lift ?
you put too much . that 's two hundred and fifty pounds .
what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year ?
no .
what if you worked out everyday for six months ? you think you could beat him then ?
no .
you think you could beat up mike tyson ? i mean before he started wiggin out and eating people 's ears ?
there 's nothing to do .
i 'll help you .
i 'm going to work out .
what things ?
jeremy . i 'm going in . i have to do some things .
just one --
why 'd you do that ?
just play one set of downs . i told them you were great .
i 'm going to go in .
in under six seconds . i 've heard .
he going pro in the draft . they say he can run the fifty --
how about your room then ? if you get scared like before , you can come back in here ?
i wo n't make any noise .
i think it 's be better if i was alone .
i want to sleep here tonight .
jeremy , why do n't you go sleep with your mom ?
that 's what i said to my son . he said , there 's always two kinds . the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there 's the real threat . the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind .
he does n't look very threatening .
is david dunne there ?
yeah , hello .
this kid is six foot two , two hundred and forty pounds . he runs the fifty in under six seconds . he 's going to be a god .
not really .
i 'm meeting a player from temple university . he 's a cornerback . you like football ?
you represent someone in philadelphia ?
but i 'm afraid of water , so that 's been holding my career back a little bit .
is that right ?
what a coincidence ? i 'm a male synchronized swimmer and i 'm looking for representation .
it 's my field . i represent athletes . i 'm an agent .
you like sports ?
no .
did you get up from your seat ?
no .
was your family traveling with you ?
yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?
in the passenger car ?
against a window .
where were you sitting on the train ?
fine .
you are in the emergency room of the university of pennsylvania hospital . you were in a serious accident . how 's your vision ?
okay .
how are you feeling ?
i believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- i believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- i believe your husband is one of those individuals .
for a second there i thought you were a fanatic .
i own a comic book museum . it 's called the limited edition .
is this a religious thing ?
and what was that explanation ?
there have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years . i 've followed each one of them ... a seven-three-seven crashes on take off . one hundred and seventy-two die . no survivors ... a hotel fire downtown . two hundred and eleven die . no survivors ... and am amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city . one hundred and thirty one die . one survivor . he is unharmed . i 've spoken with your husband about his survival . i suggested a rather unbelievable explanation . since then , i 've come to believe , that my explanation , however unbelievable , is in fact , true .
... and everyone lived happily ever after .
any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .
you and my mother would have a special connection .
football was n't the kind of life i wanted ... for ten years i 'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it was n't that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . i 've seen way too much of it in my job ... i can barely take it when my clients are in pain . i do n't hate the game . i admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , i was in awe of how he could play it , but i could n't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it 's not a thing many people would understand .
how so ?
... see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he could n't play football anymore . if that had n't happened , we would n't have been together .
now you 're going to have to tell me more .
how did you get together ?
twelve years .
how long have you been married ?
we 're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this . it works the quadriceps .
on a bench , across the street .
where is it ?
well , go get it then .
forget why . do you want it or not ?
why ?
... i got a present for you .
you ca n't do anything about that . you might fall between that chair and this television . if that 's what god has planned for you , that 's what 's going to happen . you ca n't hide from it in your room .
i 'm not going out anymore . i 'm not getting hurt again . this was the last time . i told you .
no more sitting in this room . i 've let it go on long enough .
innocent of what ?
you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man , you big asshole .
on account of they seen you was beatin ' on their friend .
if they was just here for the fuckin ' , how come they lit out the back window ?
like whores ?
ai n't you seen enough blood for one night ? hell , alice , they ai n't loafers nor tramps nor bad men . they 're hard workin ' boys that was foolish . why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way ...
for what they done ? skinny gets some ponies an ' that 's ... ?
i fined 'em instead .
you ... you ai n't even gon na ... whip 'em ?
but what they done , they ...
whippin ' ai n't a little thing , alice .
a whippin ' ? that 's all they get ? after what they done ?
all she done was ... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker ... she gave a giggle . that 's all . she did n't know no better .
no ?
she 's gon na live . she did n't steal nothin ' , she did n't touch his poke .
thank god .
rain 's coming .
what you gon na do when somebody comes to collect ? fuck 'em ? fuck 'em a thousand times ? the kind of people who 'll come after that thousand , they wo n't tolerate if you do n't have it . they wo n't just cut your face up a little . stupid cunts !
we was ... lyin ' .
you told them cowboys you had it .
we ai n't got it . we ai n't got no money .
where 'd you get the money , huh ?
i told you , he do n't have no wife , not aboveground , anyhow .
he said ...
what wife ? he do n't have no wife .
that kid ... he 's just a ... boy . and that other one , bill , being true to his wife ...
what did you think , they come clear up from kansas to fuck us ?
i did n't think they 'd really do it .
ah , i see .
do n't matter . they burned the table in '78 for firewood .
billiards , eh ? even though i do n't really wish to play ?
down the street and across . greely 's beer garden and billiard parlor . just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards .
now this strawberry alice person , tell me again .
a wise policy . but if you did , i can assure you , the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand ... in awe . whereas , a president ... i mean , why not shoot a president ?
i would n't point no pistol at nobody , sir .
why , if you were to point a pistol at a king or a queen , sir , i can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied ...
just wondered . anybody could be scared .
little bill come out of kansas an ' texas , boys . he worked them tough towns .
we never seen him up against any ... like these ones ... killers .
maybe he ai n't so tough .
asked what they looked like , that 's all . christ , maybe he 's tough but he sure ai n't no carpenter .
he did n't say nothin ' , huh ?
little bill ? he did n't say nothing . like i said , he was buildin ' his porch . have you seen that thing ?
what 'd he say ?
'course he 's coming .
he 's coming ai n't he ?

uh ... yeah . yeah . she 's uh ... watchin ' over the little ones .

yeah , i guess .
i admire that , you being true to your wife . i 've seen a lot of ... of men ... who were n't .
yeah . see ?
your wife ?
you 're a beautiful woman an ' ... if i was to want a free one , i guess i 'd want you more than them others . it ai n't ... see ... i ca n't have no free one on account of my wife ...
i ... i guess not . i did n't mean i did n't want one 'cause of you bein ' cut up . i did n't mean that .

you know how women kin lie ... i knock 'em around a little , ask 'em where the money is , they say they do n't have none ? ... but they coulda squirreled away that much , the five of 'em . maybe .

huh ? hullo , skinny . snuck up on me . how do you like her ?
hit your finger , huh ?
you boys are off of the spade outfit . got your own string of ponies ?
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin ' , but nobody 's gon na pay good money for a cut-up whore .
hell no . leastways , they wo n't pay to do it .
you figure nobody 'll want to fuck her .
damaged property . like if i was to hamstring one of their cow ponies .
property .
this here 's a lawful contract ... betwixt me an ' delilah fitzgerald , the cut-whore . now i brung her clear from boston , paid her expenses an ' all , an ' i got a contract which represents an investment of capital .
no ?
shut up , alice . little bill , a whippin ' ai n't gon na settle this .
i 'll see you ... in hell , you three fingered asshole .
`` deserve '' do n't mean shit , little bill .
i do n't ... deserve this ... to die this way . i was ... building a house .
i have done that ... killed women and children ... i have killed most everything that walks or crawls an ' now i have come to kill you , little bill , for what you done to ned . now step aside . boys .
i guess you are three-fingered jack out of missouri , killer of women and children .
he should have armed himself if he was gon na decorate his saloon with the body of my friend .
well , uh ... it ai n't loaded .
there ai n't no snakes in here , mister hendershot .
uh ... yeah . yeah .
i guess you just carry it for snakes an ' such .
i ... i guess i might ... but like i said , i ai n't armed .
well , mister hendershot , if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an ' a liar , an ' if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul ... well , i guess then , you would show me your pistol right quick an ' shoot me dead , ai n't that so ?
uh , william ... uh ... hendershot .
what 's your name ?
like i said , i ...
you 're spillin ' your whiskey , mister .
i ... dunno . i mean , i guess not . no , they ai n't carryin ' no guns .
them friends of yours in the back , they carryin ' pistols ?
well ... uh ... i ... i ai n't got no , uh , firearms .
ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the county office day or night . i guess you did n't read it with the weather an ' all .
uh , no . no , i ai n't drunk .
uh ... hang the ... uh ... carpenter . i ...
what ?
maybe you should ... hang the carpenter .
huh ? oh . another one , huh ? shit , i guess i 'm clean out of receptacles .
uh ... sheriff ... uh ...
i do not like assassins an ' men of low character like your friend english bob ... but bob ai n't no coward who will cry to your face an ' then ...
no , ... but i ca n't abide them kind ... an ' you will find a lot of them in the saloons ... tramps an ' drunk teamsters an ' crazy miners ... sportin ' pistols like they was bad men , but not having no sand nor character ... not even bad character .
did you ... kill him ?
`` well , jim , '' i says , `` it makes me sick to see a man struttin ' around and packin ' two pistols an ' a henry rifle and cryin ' like a baby . ''
give it to him .
r-r-r-really ? you r-r-really w- wwant ... ?
would n't be no good if it was n't . you got to cock it though .
is ... is it ... loaded ?
them 's the keys . all you got ta do is shoot me an ' you an ' english bob can ride out free as birds .
then he will kill you . that is why there are so few dangerous men like old bob there ... an ' like me . it ai n't so easy to shoot a man anyhow ... an ' if the sonofabitch is shootin ' back at you ... well , it 'll unnerve most fellas . look here , let me show you somethin ' . see this here pistol ?
but ... if he does n't miss ?
he will be hurryin ' and he will miss . that there is as fast as i can pull an ' aim an ' hit anythin ' more'n ten feet away ... unless it 's a barn .
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first ...
well he was n't gon na wait for corky to grow no new hand . he walked over real close , bein ' drunk , an ' shot him through the liver .
you ... you mean ... english bob killed him while ... ?
bam ! that walker colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end .
and ?
well , that bullet whizzin ' by panicked corky , an ' he done the wrong thing ! pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe . meantime , bob aims good and squeezes off another ... but he 's so drunk he misses again an ' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar . well , now the duck of death is good as dead 'cause this time corky does right an ' aims real good , no hurry ...
some folks did call old corky `` two gun '' but not because he was sportin ' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that walker colt he carried . an ' the only insultin ' he done was stickin ' that big dick of his in some french lady that old bob was sweet on ... well , one day corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knows what 's happening bob takes a shot at him ... and misses on account of he 's drunker than hell .
but he was called ...
first off ... corky did n't carry two pistols , though he should of .
you were there ?
well , mister beauchamp , i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran ... an ' i did n't see you there ... nor no woman , nor no twogun shooters nor nothin ' like that .
i believe that to be an accurate description of the events , sir ... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which ...
duck , i says . `` you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman , corcoran , '' said the duck . `` you must apologize . '' but two gun corcoran would have none of it and , cursing , he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns . ''
duke .
meaning the duck himself , i guess .
uh ... i can assure you , mister daggett ... the events described within are based ... on the accounts of eye witnesses and ...
well , mister beauchamp ... from what i read of this here book , i 'd have to say the writin ' ai n't a whole lot different from the pitcher .
uh ... it 's ... uh ... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ... ah ... take certain license in depicting the cover scene ... for ... ah ... purposes involving the ... ah , market place .
uh ... duke .
that is you there , ai n't it , bob ? the duck of death ?
d-d-d-duke . the d-d-duke of death .
the ... duck of death .
a book , huh ? i guess that means you can read ... an ' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms ... but then , like you told old andy there , you ai n't armed , are you , bob ?
it 's only a b-b-b-book ...
letters ?
n-no . i wr-wr-wr-write ... i wr- wrwrite ...
you work for the railroads too , mister beauchamp ?
lemmee see that schofield , kid .
n-no , sir ?
did n't scare little bill though , did it ?
he said how you was really three fingered jack out of missouri ... an ' bill said `` same three fingered jack that dynamited the rock island and pacific in '69 killin ' women and children an ' all ? '' an ' ned says you done a lot worse than that , said you was more cold blooded than william bonney or clay alisson or the james brothers an ' how if he hurt ned again you was gon na come an ' kill him like you killed a u.s. marshall in '73 .
not on purpose . but he started hurtin ' him worse ... makin ' him tell stuff . first ned would n't say nothin ' ... but little bill hurt him so bad he said who you was ...
an ' little bill killed ned for what i done ?
a cowboy come in sayin ' you killed quick mike in the shit house at the bar t ...
then ... what ?
l-lies ... at first . about how you was just passin ' through and did n't kill nobody ... an ' little bill kept askin ' questions , mixin ' him up , catchin ' lies ... an ' then he 'd beat on ned an ' ned would cry and lie some more an ' then ... then ...
what 'd ned say ?
about where you an ' him was ... an ' where you was from ... an ' what your names was ... an ' ...
the questions little bill asked him ... what sort of questions was they ?
they got a sign on him in front of greely 's ?
in front of greely 's . it says , `` this here is what happens to ... ''
a sign on him ?
they got ... a sign on him says he was a killer .
good example ! good example of what i 'd like to know ? he did n't even kill nobody ... he could n't do it no more .
n-no . he ... he beat him up . he was making him ... answer questions ... and beating him up ... and then ... ned just died . little bill did n't mean to kill him ... he said he was sorry an ' all ... but he said it was a good example anyhow .
he hanged him ? shot him down ?
little bill . the ... the bar t boys caught him and little bill ...
who killed him ?
nobody did n't kill ned , he went south yesterday . he did n't even kill nobody . why would anybody kill ned ?
they ... they killed him . i ... thought you know that . i thought you knew because ...
no he ai n't . he went south yesterday .

she gave me the evil eye .
sally ?

we done stuff before for money , ned .
easy , huh ? hell , i do n't know that it was all that easy then ... an ' we was young an ' full of beans . bill ... if you was mad at 'em ... if they done you wrong ... i could see shootin ' 'em ...

how long since you shot a gun at a man ? nine ... ten years ?
should be easy killin ' em ... supposin ' they do n't run off to texas first .
we ai n't bad men no more , bill . hell , we 're farmers .
naw , son , i did n't kill nobody .
i guess you did n't kill nobody then .
before i met your maw , god rest her soul , it used to be i was kinda ... wicked ... drinkin ' spirits an ' gettin ' into scrapes an ' all . only she made me see the error of my ways an ' ... i ai n't like i was no more .

i ca n't spot 'em myself but you could . that red-haired one , you could spot a half-mile off , i bet .

that ai n't what i mean .
we 'll bury him .
well , suppose he does ?
maybe .
he 's gon na die , ai n't he ?

we done that stuff .
all of it . about him , an ' you an ' uncle pete ... about robbin ' the rock island pacific ... an ' about them missouri banks .
depends what he told you . about bill , you mean ?
we do n't need him . the two of us could do it .
i do n't kill nobody without him .
three days ? we could kill 'em tomorrow .
we 're gon na need more food ... at least three days worth ...
that was your idea , i wanted to ...
shit , kid , you pulled your pistol ... right outta the lady an ' out the back window .
well , i guess i woulda at least pulled my pistol an ...
he ai n't as tough as you , kid .
he did n't even pull his pistol , huh ?
he would n't of took no beating like that if it had n't of jammed . he would n't just give it over an ' not shoot no one .
move the candle closer , i ca n't see .
his pistol must of jammed .
plenty of times .
jesus . you done this before ?

how many you killed , kid ?
well , i got ta know what kind of fellas i 'm ridin ' with , do n't i ? in case of a scrape .
i do n't like the question .
how many men you killed ? ai n't you gon na answer ?

he 's blind , for chri ...
fuck you .

you was right to change your mind , kid .
oh , them . hell , i seen them .

well , this here 's ned logan ... ned , this here 's the schofield kid , nephew of pete sothow an ' ...
thought you was followin ' me .
what was you shootin ' at us for , anyhow ?
there 's more .
keyser soze
and ?
a boy came across a body on the beach this morning . thrown clear when the boat burned . shot once in the head . two guys from the f.b.i . just identified him . +
bear with me here ...
who ?
they tell me you got the cripple from new york in there . he mention keyser soze
i do n't get it .
he did n't know . no one doing the deal knew except a few key people . this guy says they were real hush about it . whatever it was it was highly sensitive .
what was the money for ?
we know , but our man says no way on the dope . this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next ' day . they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
there was ninety-one million -
you can stop looking . there was no coke . i 've been in l.a. county with a guy they
yeah .
i 've been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ?
jack . what are you doing here ?
he says the hair is longer and lighter .
& lt ; & lt ; do n't be stupid. & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; are you sure ? & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; it is longer than that . and not so dark . & gt ; & gt ;
+ the nose is sharper . smaller too . + & lt ; & lt ; and what about the hair ? you said something earlier about it. & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; it was smaller than that . sharper. & gt ; & gt ;
he says he knows his face . he sees it when he closes his eyes .
& lt ; & lt ; keyser soze . keyser sate . i 've seen his face . i see it when i close my eyes. & gt ; & gt ;
no good . he needs guarantees . he says ... his life is in danger ... he has seen the devil ... looked him in the eye .
& lt ; & lt ; no , no , no . i need a guarantee from the ridiculous man . i am going to be killed . i have seen the devil and looked him in the eye. & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; i 'll tell you everything . i'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it . just tell this man i want protection . real protection. & gt ; & gt ;
not dope . something else . some what ? .. he does n't knob what they were buying . but not dope ... people .
he says they were buying it does n't make sense . i 'm sorry , i 'm a little rusty . they were there to buy something .
& lt ; & lt ; we were there to buy a man and take him back to hungary. & gt ; & gt ;
edie , please .
i do n't know what you came here for , but we wo n't have any part of it .
that 's enough , edie .
alright .
come home , dean .
dean , i love you . do you hear me ?
they ruined me tonight .
i love you .
they 'll never stop .
do n't give up on me now , dean .
no . it 's never going to stop , period . it wo n't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us . it 's finished . i 'm finished .
give me some credit . i got you this far , let 's go to the grand jury . this is never going to stop if we -
time for what , edie ? time to look into me a little more , that 's what . no matter how well you cover my tracks now , they 'll find out who i am .
they just said they wanted time .
goddamnit .
they want more time to think about investing .
edie , please . i do n't want to hear this right now . what did renault and fortier say ?
i'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday .
just forget about it .
... and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he ca n't release you ? can you believe that ? you were n't even charged . new york police - jesus . i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d.a . first thing in the morning .
you 've come far . you 're a good man . i love you .
i 'm having a stroke .
now remember , this is another kind of business . they do n't earn your respect . you owe it to them . do n't stare them down but do n't look away either . confidence . they are fools not to trust you . that 's the attitude .
a hijacker like dean , here ? or something more creative ?
umm ...
so what is it you do , mr. kint ?
a glass of water would be nice .
i hope so , too , mr. kint . can i get you something to drink ?
i hope i did n't disturb you .
i know who he is .
i do n't know . this is bad .
come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
yeah . he said he did jobs for him . indirect stuff . always five times more money than the job was worth .
i do n't know . who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york ?
this is not right .
i do n't want to know .
fuck you . i'11 never shit right again . so who did it ? own up .
i had a guy 's fingers in my asshole tonight .
it was the feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , customs comes down on n.y.p.d . for some answers - they come up with us . they 're grabbing at straws . it 's politics - nothing you can do .
so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?
how many times have you been in a line- up ? it 's always you and four dummies . the p.d . pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they 'd line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line-.up ? a public defender could get you off of that .
this whole thing was a shakedown .
forget him . it 's not important . i was trying to make a point .
do your friend a favor , fenster , keep him quiet .
i 'd say you 've gotten on his main and central nerve , mcmanus .
the way i hear it , soze is some kind of butcher . no pity .
it 's bullshit . this guy could be l.a.p.d . i think it 's a setup .
they fucking know everything .
everybody i ever worked with , did time with .
right there . freeze .
do n't move , you fuckers .
we all go . how about it , keaton ?
then who goes ?
i 'm sure you can understand my hesitation .
why you got ta go and do that ? i 'm trying to make a point .
you are a criminal .
you 're fuckin ' a right , no p.c . well screw p.c . no right . no goddamn right . you do some time , they never let you go . treat me like a criminal , i 'll end up a criminal .
doubtful . with all that coke , they 'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two . even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat , we get nothing .
can we stealth these guys ?
it 's a logistical nightmare . close quarters , no advance layout , ten men , maybe twenty .
dig .
keaton , we got ta go . they 're gon na find him .
what do you care what he says ?
why do n't you just calm down '
his name is verbal kint . i thought you guys knew him .
how do i know that ? how about it , pretzel-man ? what 's your story ?
he 's alright .
the word i got is you hung up your spurs , man . what 's that all about ?
you heard right .
if i 'm going in , i want a stake .
did you hear what he just said ?
me too .
i can run . i got no problem with that .
what are we gon na do ?
yeah , i was gon na tell you to shut up .
roger really . people say i talk too much .
hockney was just a bad bastard . good with explosives . mean as a snake when it mattered .
i know you . you do n't think i know you 're on the take . this whole fucking precinct is dirty . you do n't have a fucking leg to stand on .
just do what i tell you .
what if i
i want you to find edie . both of you find some place safe . tell her what happened - everything . she knows people . she 'll know what to do . if we ca n't get kobayashi my way , she 'll get him her way .
keaton , i ca n't just -
hungarian ?
russian , i think . i do n't know .
what-are they speaking ?
who 's keyser soze ?
what is this ?
something - i do n't know . i ever tell you about the restaurant i wanted to open ?
what is it keaton ?
we 'll make it .
do n't do this . send her a card - something .
we 'll make it .
not if we do it my way .
no killing ?
maybe more .
three million ?
they 're pretty pissed off . they 'll do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they wo n't let me in without you .
fenster and hockney ?
mcmanus wants to go in shooting . i said no way .
how are they going to do it ?
forget it . i'11 probably shit blood tonight .
well , i 'm sorry .
i'11 be alright .
you okay ?
i was out of line .
okay , okay . you say it 's the real thing ? that 's cool .
you watch your mouth .
do n't tell me you do n't need this . is this your place ?
tough break .
they - they do n't know me . you do . they wo n't take me unless you go . look at me . i need this .
what 's with you ? what do you care whether i come or not ?
you have to come .
never heard of him .
some guy in california . his name is redfoot .
what fence ? who ?
mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct . they 're coming out for one job - thursday . they 're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america . fenster and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff .
they - that 's bullshit . they do n't operate anymore .
hurt you , you sonofabitch ? i could kill you .
do n't hurt me .
if you 'll just let me -
get out .
they 're gon na do a job . three million dollars , maybe more .
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but do n't think we 're friends . i 'm sorry , but i have other things -
i wanted to talk to you . the other guys -
what the hell do you want ?
verb - roger , this is edie finneran . edie , this is roger kint , he was at
how do you do ?
i walked . ninety days , suspended .
you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ?
county . i was in for fraud .
we 've met once or twice . last time was in ...
hey , that was your mistake , not mine . did you ever think to ask me ? i 've been
you know damn well , dead-man .
with what ?
this i had to see myself .
let 's say for example -
what time is it ?
ready ?
i 'd have to say my spine was broken , keyser .
how are you , keaton ?
am i ? 92 92 int . hallway - fiftieth floor
you 're lying .
no matter . kill away , mr. mcmanus .
edie finneran . she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition . i requested she be put on the case personally . she flew out yesterday .
what did you say ?
we 'll see .
i am sorry , mr. mcmanus . f implore you to believe me , mr. keaton . mr. soze is very real and very + determined .
neither do we .
mr. so- my employer has made up his mind . he does not change it .
we know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . i 'm offering you the chance to call this off .
ahh , mr. hockney . do join us .
a strange threat . i can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . pity about mr. redfoot .
listen to me , cocksucker . there is no keyser sate . if you say his name again , i'11 kill you right here .
mr. soze will be most -
the answer is no .
mr. redfoot knew nothing . mr. soze rarely t works with the same people for very long , and they never know who they 're working for . one can not be betrayed if one has no people .
what about redfoot ?
mr. soze made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until i came to see you . it seems mr. keaton 's attorney , ms. finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point .
you set up the line-up .
i work for keyser sate .
do n't jerk me off . we all know what this is . you do n't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i 'm working for . now let 's cut the shit . who 's the man ?
my employer wishes to remain anonymous .
who 's your boss ?
my employer requires your services . one job . one day 's work . very dangerous . i do n't expect all of you to live , but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit .
tell him we 'll meet .
he wants to meet you . he called last night and asked me to set it up . what do i tell him '
we want to meet him .
some limey . he 's a middle-man for somebody . he does n't say and i do n't ask .
who is he ?
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer .
you did n't know .
get a grip . i did n't know .
ai n't it a crime ? call if you 're interested .
a little of both .
business or personal ?
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later .
i shivved him .
i hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . i used to run a lot of dope for him . fuckin ' shame he got shivved .
a friend of mine in new york tells me you knew spook hollis .
take your time . enjoy l.a .
i 've got a ton of work and no good people .
we 're on vacation .
nothing . something i - forget it .
what ?
a rumor is not a rumor that does n't die .
waste of time .
i'11 find him .
keyser sate or not , if keaton 's alive he 'll never come up again .
no matter . he 'll have to know how close we came .
which is shit .
i know what i wanted to know about keaton .
where ?
someplace else , then .
he wo n't go into the interrogation room .
i want to see him .
two hours , tops .
when does he post bail ?
what'the fuck is that ?
weapons . misdemeanor two .
did they charge him with anything ?
the d.a . came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . kint 's lawyer comes in and five minutes later , the d.a . comes out looking like he 'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man . they took his statement and cut him a deal .
what do you mean i ca n't see him ?
kobayashi .
his name was arturo marquez . a petty smuggler out of argentina . he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking . he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach . they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again . get this - edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings .
i do n't think he does . not exactly , but there 's a lot more to his story . i want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that was n't there . above all , i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead .
that 's crazy , dave and it does n't matter . he has total immunity and his story checks out . he does n't know what you want to know .
you know damn well what i think .
and i am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions .
if it was a dope deal , where 's the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ?
no , no , no , no , no .
this wo n't be an ' interrogation , just a ... friendly chat to kill time .
even if i was to let you talk to him , he wo n't talk to you . he 's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
maybe so , but i 'm no rat , agent kujan . you tricked me , that 's all . i wo n't keep my mouth shut 'cause i 'm scared . i'11 keep it shut 'cause i let keaton down by getting caught - edie finneran too . and if they kill me , it 's
where are you going to go , verbal ? you gon na run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know they 'll get you out there .
i'11 take my chances , thank you . it 's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop .
you posted twenty minutes ago . captain leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p. , unless you turn state 's .
i 'm not bait . no way . i post today .
is he keyser soze i do n't know , verbal . it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but i know keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . stay here and let us protect you .
you think he's.. ?
you 're not safe on your own .
you know what it 's like , agent kujan , to know you 'll never be good ? not good like you . you got good all fucked around . i mean a stand up guy . i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything 'cause i was a cripple . shit , i was n't
why lie about everything else , then ?
i did n't know . i saw him die . i believe he 's dead . christ
it was all keaton . we followed him from the beginning .
if he 's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it wo n't matter . it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york , was n't it ? tell me the truth .
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . customs has been
i knew him . he would never -
he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you did n't see him die .
this is all bullshit .
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he could n't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
edie ...
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran .
no , no , no , no , no .
no .
keaton was keyser soze
no ...
no , verbal . you were n't friends . keaton did n't have friends . he saved you because he wanted it that way . it was his will .
because he was my friend .
i do n't buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly do n't believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?
edie .
why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why '
he wanted me to live .
verbal , he left you behind for a reason . if you all knew soze could find you anywhere , why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat ?
but how - wait . you 're saying soze sent t us to kill someone ?
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .
i do n't
but keaton had . edie finneran was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .
i said i never heard of him .
his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians . most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey . the money was n't there for dope . the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them .
i never heard of him .
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser soze and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .
it was keyser soze , agent kujan . i mean the devil himself . how do you shoot the devil in the back ?
but keaton ...
i was afraid , okay ? somehow , i was sure it was keyser soze at that point . i could n't bring myself to raise my gun to him .
then why did n't you help him ?
i do n't understand what you 're saying . i saw keaton get shot , i swear to you .
you know . you 've known this whole fucking time . give it to me .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
try to reef lying to me now . i know everything .
yes you do . you know what i 'm getting at . the truth . try to tell me you did n't know . try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton .
i do n't .
do n't shine me , verbal . no more stalling . you know what i 'm getting at .
i do n't have a minute . are you saying it was keyser soze ? you told the d.a . you did n't know who it was .
wait a minute .
a man in a suit with a slim build . tall .
i tried , believe me , but keaton would n't have it . it was too far-fetched for him . keaton was a grounded guy . an ex-cop . to a cop , the explanation is never that complicated . it 's always simple . there 's
why did n't you say anything ?
i wanted to . i thought we could make it .
kobayashi told us where we could find fenster .
what call ?
mcmanus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .
then what ?
what happened ?
give a guy a break , huh ?
you 're stalling , verbal .
the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing i had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than i did . they knew all of us .
can we just get back to kobayashi ?
oh , but it 's not . if i had n't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , i never would have took off for new york . i never would have met keaton , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .
this is totally irrelevant .
that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois .
gee , thanks , dave . bang-up job so far . extortion , coercion . you 'll pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker . the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me they 'll bail me out ? fuck you . you think you can catch keyser soze ? you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out ? if he comes up for anything , it will be to get rid of me . after that , my guess is you 'll never hear from him again .
so why play into his hands ? we can protect you .
where 's your head , agent kujan ? where do you think the pressure 's coming from ? keyser soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where i am right now . he 's got the front burner under ' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . immunity was just to deal with you assholes . i got a whole new problem when i post bail .
if there is a keyser soze he 'll be looking for you .
i 've got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ?
turn state 's evidence . take the stand on this and we 'll hear it out .
you tell me , agent kujan . if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?
and this is why you never told the d.a .
i came clean . i told it like it happened on the boat . so what if i left out how i got there ? it 's got so many holes in it , the d.a . would 've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal .
keaton always said : & quot ; i do n't believe in god , but i 'm afraid of him. & quot ; well i believe in god , and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze .
do you believe in him , verbal ?
and why leave this out when you talked to the d.a . ?
right .
came from redfoot .
kobayashi .
so this lawyer ...
convince me . tell me every last detail . 52 scene deleted 52 53 int . hospital - day 53 + kovash 's room is now filled with people . jack baer stands next to daniel metzheiser , a balding man in his forties . next to him is doctor plumber . across from her is ridgly waiters .
no . but i 'm sure keaton 's dead .
is he the one that killed keaton ?
there was a lawyer . kobayashi .
not from me , you piece of shit . there is no immunity from me . you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind . every criminal i have put in prison ,
the d.a . gave me immunity .
you think i do n't know you held out on the d.a. ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes .
what lawyer ?
he was n't behind anything . it was the lawyer .
i do n't think you do . but you say you saw keaton die . i think you 're covering his ass and he 's still out there somewhere . i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he 's using you because you 're stupid and you think he 's your friend . you tell me he 's dead , so be it . i want to make sure he 's dead before i go back to new york .
i do n't know about that .
do i ? keaton was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force . + in every case , witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify . when they t finally did nail him for fraud , he spent + five years in sing sing . he killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death . of course i ca n't prove this but i ca n't prove the best part either .
you got him wrong .
let me tell you something . i know dean keaton . i 've been investigating him for three years . the guy i know is a cold- + blooded bastard . l.a.p.d . indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force , so do n't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold . +
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t keaton . it was n't like that . sure he knew , but edie had him all turned around . r i 'm telling you straight , i swear . +
come on . keaton was a cop for four years . who else would know the taxi service
that was all fenster and mcmanus .
sure . and i 'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service was n't his idea
he loved her .
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you 're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her .
you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , i 'm telling you .
heartwarming . really , i feel weepy .
i 'm not a rat .
i'11 get right to the point . i 'm smarter than you . i'11 find out what i want to know and i'11 get it from you whether you like it or not .
no .
the first thing i learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let 's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you 're guilty , you know you 're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?
i'11 be sure to mention that to him .
there 's nothing in there about ruby .
i know ruby . he 's very big on respect . likes me very much .
he did n't have my lawyer .
you know ruby is in attica ?
you know a religious guy named john paul ?
you know a dealer named ruby deemer , verbal ?
well i do have the weapons charge . i 'm looking at six whole months hard time .
oh , i know . sweet deal you have . total immunity .
that 's been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .
according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else .
i just want to hear your story .
you trying to get a rise out of me , agent kujan ?
keaton was a piece of shit .
sure . fifteen years ago , but he was a good thief anyway , the cops would n't let him go legit .
he was a corrupt cop , verbal .
i know he was good .
i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man .
i told the d.a . everything i know .
verbal , i know you know something . i know you 're not telling us everything .
sure . and i appreciate that . and i want to help you , agent kujan . i like cops . i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my c.p . was -
verbal , you know we 're trying to help you .
counselor , you 're bluffing . shall i push for misdemeanor two ?
counselor , you 're insulting me .
weapons . misdemeanor one .
you 're joking .
mr. kint will plead guilty to weapons possession .
i'11 take my chances then . i'11 feel safer without a job if a man like mr. kint is behind bars .
then prosecute . i will be very impressed to see if the district attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy . i would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged & quot ; faceless people in city hall & quot ; you mention .
counselor , i will prosecute your client .
immunity .
may-i be frank , counselor ? i suspect your political power as much as i respect it . i do n't know why mr. kint has so many faceless allies in city hall , and i do n't care . the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here .
no provisions , nothing . my clients testimony for his immunity .
the district attorney 's office will comply provided -
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings . in exchange , his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible .
ah . how did they treat you ?
yes .
good . you ever been inside a hospital ?
i 'm fine .
abrams . yes . how are you today ?
abrams ...
mr. abraham ...
as far as we know , nothing .
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr. thompson ?
very good .
how good 's your intelligence ?
nothing .
what did he find ?
she 's the only nurse who is n't testifying for the doctors .
why did he go to see mary rooney ?
yes .
i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ...
if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?
all right . but let 's keep the price down . i 've called ed concannon . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we 're going to trial .
so what i want to do is stop it here . i 'm going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .
no . absolutely , and we 're going to see that it is not .
i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i do n't want the archdiocese exposed .
neither does he . that 's where he loses . this man 's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
no -- we do n't want this case in court .
this is a nuisance suit . he 's looking for small change . he 's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we do n't want to go to court .
... tell me about this case .
the man 's an ambulance chaser ...
four cases in three years ...
accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight . since then he 's been on his own . four cases before the circuit court . he lost them all . he drinks .
he was accused of jury tampering .
that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she 's in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she 's tied to a machine , she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her : her doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way . i came in here to take your money . i brought snapshots to show you . so i could get your money . i ca n't take it . if i take it . if i take that money i 'm lost . i 'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . i ca n't do it . i ca n't take it .
what is the truth ?
and no one will know the truth .
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .
yes . it would be .
that was our insurance company 's recommendation .
because it struck me how neatly 'three ' went into the amount . two hundred ten thousand . that would mean i keep seventy .
yes .
you thought it was just .
we thought it was just .
how did you settle on the amount ?
it 's a generous offer , mr. galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ...
does that mean i 'm back for awhile ?
they want to settle . it means a lot of money .
what does it mean ?
that 's the call that i 'm waiting for .
frank galvin 's ... who 's calling please ? bishop brophy 's office ...
this is going to drive the ante up .
... a mrs. doneghy called ... i told you that .
you know what that would mean ? to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he 'll testify ?
it looks that way .
... he wants to testify ... ?
mickey told him to call . 'he 's some very hotshot surgeon at mass . commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye . you meet him at the hospital . '
gruber ...
... that was a dr. david gruber 's office ...
... yes . get her on the phone ...
... here 's your mail , call mrs. doneghy ...
mickey told me to come back to work .
what are you doing here ?
tell us .
my god , we tried to save her ... you ca n't know ... you ca n't know ...
you reached down into death . now , is n't that right ?
yes !
... to save her and to save the baby . is that ...
... we did everything we could ...
... a patient riddled with complications , questionable information on her , on her admitting form ...
yes .
... you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . is n't that what you did ?
well , we ...
and what did your team do ...
that 's right .
... and her heart stopped and she was n't getting oxygen .
she threw up in her mask . let 's cut the bullshit . say it : she threw up in her mask .
she 'd aspirated vomitus into her mask ...
tell me one ?
well , many reasons , actually ...
why was n't she getting oxygen ... ?
it 's a common medical expression , it 's a crash program to restore the heartbeat . dr. marx cut an airway in her trachea , to get her oxygen , her and the baby ... ms.nevins ...
`code blue , ' what does that mean ... ?
we went to code blue ...
what did these people do when her heart stopped ?
mary rooney , the obstetrical nurse ...
ms. nevins , nurse-anesthetist ; dr.marx , of course ...
dr. towler , who was in the operating room with you ?
thank you . when debby ...
when she ...
anything special about the case ?
yes .
you were there to help dr. marx deliver her baby . were you not ?
yes .
answer affirmatively . simply . keep those answers to three words . you were n't `part of a group , ' you were her anesthesiologist . is n't that right ?
... i was one of a group of ...
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy ...
i was her doctor .
say it .
yes .
whatever the `truth ' is , let 's hear that . you were her doctor .
do n't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth .
no , actually , she was referred to me . she was dr. hagman 's patient ...
and you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you 'd ruin their lives .
objection !
your honor ... ! your honor ...
... almost nine minutes ... causing brain damage .
we 've touched on this , his own witness has said ...
... to get her heartbeat back ... ?
objection , we 've ...
frank galvin . we 've met before .
ed concannon .
objection .
i did .
do you , indeed . i 'll bet you do . fine . fine . we 'll save the court the time . we will admit the doctor as an `expert witness , ' fine .
sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , i am available . i am seventy-four years old , i am not board-certified . i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done .
yes , we 've heard that . doctor : you testify quite a bit against other physicians ? is n't that right ? you , you 're available for that ? when you 're paid to be there ?
i 'm on the staff of ...
uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ?
i am seventy-four years old .
how old are you ?
`methodology and techniques of anesthesiology . ' yes .
... of anesthesiology ?
meth ... methodology and technique ...
what book is that ?
through , through his book .
how is that ?
i know of him .
do you know dr. robert towler ... ?
i 'm just an m.d .
orthopedics ?
no .
neurology ?
no .
... i 'm sure it is , but this is massachusetts , doctor . certified in internal medicine ?
no , i am not . it 's quite common in new york state ...
are you board-certified in anesthesiology , doctor ?
just as you are , sir ...
engaged to render an opinion . for a price . is that correct ? you 're being paid to be here today ?
that is correct . i was engaged to render an opinion .
dr. thompson , just so the jury knows , you never treated deborah ann kaye . is that correct ?
i 'm going to uphold that .
thank you , your honor . further : ms. costello is a rebuttal witness . as a `surprise witness ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form . it 's unsubstantiated and we ca n't accept a copy in preference to the original ...
... one moment , mr. concannon ...
thank you , your honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana , u.s. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code : 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' and , your honor , having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the xerox form .
you may step down .
no further questions .
i 'll rule on that presently . proceed .
objection ! this is ri ... expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right ...
mr. galvin , rebuttal ?
nothing further , your honor .
mr. concannon ... ?
my doctors did n't want a settlement at any price . they wanted this cleared up in court . they want their vindication . i agree with them . but for today the offer stands . before we begin the publicity of a trial . for today only . when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn . as long as you understand that . it 's got to be that way .
huh !
your honor , bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars .
after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . dr. towler called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said ... he said he 'd fire me . he said i 'd never work again ... .who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ? i wanted to be a nurse ...
and why , please tell us , would you think that ?
i thought i would need it .
... what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears ? this is a ... why ? why would you do that ?
because i kept a copy . i have it right here .
you did n't write that figure . and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years ?
yes , i , yes , i signed it , yes . but i , i did n't write that figure .
you 've just said you signed it .
that 's not my handwriting .
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
i do . yes .
`they lied . ' indeed ! when did they lie ? and do you know what a lie is ?
they lied .
you know these doctors could have settled out of court . they wanted a trial . they wanted to clear their names .
i ...
then , please , which is correct ? you 've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago . four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago ? which is the lie . when were you lying ?
i ... yes .
and was n't that an oath ... ? these are your initials here : k.c . when you signed this chart you took an oath . no less important than that which you took today . is n't that right ? is n't that right ... ?
i . . ..
now . i 'd like to ask you something : four years ago , when you were working as a nurse , are you aware that drs . towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
yes .
... sworn before god you would tell the truth ?
yes .
just now ...
yes .
in fact , you 've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . you 've just sworn to that . is n't that right ?
no .
you would not ... ?
i would n't do it .
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime .
it 's a crime .
you are aware of the penalties for perjury ... ?
i understand . i went to the bar association . they tell me you 're going to be disbarred .
if i could accept the offer right now , i would . they took it back .
you guys , you guys , you 're all the same . the doctors at the hospital , you ... it 's 'what i 'm going to do for you ' ; but you screw up it 's `we did the best that we could . i 'm dreadfully sorry ... ' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives .
i 'm going to win this case ... mist ... mr. doneghy ... i 'm going to the jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and i 'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars .
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...
i swear to you i would n't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case ...
you ruined my life , mister ... me and my wife ... and i am going to ruin yours ... you do n't have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years ... my wife 's been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .
it 's all right , mickey .
i 'm going to have you disbarred . i 'm going to have your ticket . you know what you did ? do you know what you did ?
hold on a second .
you said you 're gon na call me up . you did n't call me up . who do you think you are ? who do you think you are ... ?
it 's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...
what is this going to cost ?
we just ...
i completely understand ...
... we told them we did n't want it to come out this way .
i doubt we 'll have to go to trial ...
... the archdiocese called up , they said who was our attorney , 'cause the case is coming to trial ...
i was telling your wife , we have a very good case here .
... that 's all right .
please sit down . i told your wife . i 'm sorry that we have to meet out here . i 've got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers .
it 's a common medical term .
'code blue ' ...
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life 's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what code blue means ?
actually , yes . it 's by no means bad , i ...
she getting good care over there ?
... i made a detailed physical examination of the patient , sir , yesterday evening , i ...
easthampton hospital for women . excuse me , what is that , a joke ? let me tell you something , doctor , those men at catherine laboure . men who are known not only in this city , but the world , were trying to save a woman 's life . they were there , and here you are , four years later , read some hospital report , and say ...
i am on the staff of ...
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ?
i am seventy-four years old .
is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ?
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart .
... that 's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance ... she ...
why is that ?
they gave her the wrong anesthetic .
i ... um ...
the doctors were not negligent .
i ... given the limits of your question , that 's correct .
then you 're saying there 's no negligence , based on my question ?
i ... in that small context i would have ... i would have to say 'no . '
well ...
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice ?
no . no . thank you . you go home .
you sure you do n't want me to stay on .
yes ... i ... yes .
you know ... sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth .
no . no thank you , doctor . you go home .
i 'm afraid that 's not true . will you want me to stay on till monday ?
no , you did fine .
i did n't do too well for you .
it 's my opinion it took him much longer . nine ... ten minutes . there 's too much brain damage .
now , dr. towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she 's in the state she 's in today .
dr. thompson . from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy-six . in your opinion , what happened to deborah ann kaye ?
there 's nothing they can do to me .
these people play very rough . they do n't want to lose this case . there 's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , i ...
... what difference would ...
... apartment . no , no . please . you do n't know who we 're dealing with , i , please believe me , they ...
... i made a reservation at ...
yes . yes . i think so . i hope you 'll be comfortable . i 'm putting you up at my ...
from what i 've seen , mr. galvin , you have a very good case ...
i 'm going to take you to the home to see the girl ...
that 's what i 'd planned to ...
i have some errands to run , and then i thought we 'd spend the evening ...
it was good of you to meet ...
dr. thompson ... ?
thank you .
negligent . yes ... it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anaesthetic ... the type you gave her ... would have been negligent ... ?
she threw up in her mask , yes . but she had n't eaten one hour prior to admission .
... page 414 , 'if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to deborah ann kaye ? she aspirated into her mask ?
yes .
and you wrote that ...
i. yes . it is .
'practice and methodology in anaesthesia . ' general textbook on the subject . is that correct ?
yes . i wrote it .
dr. towler ; page 406 , 'contraindications to general anaesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic . ' does that sound familiar ?
to do right . is n't that why you 're doing it ?
uh , why , why are you doing this ?
... that 's perfectly all right .
thank you ...
... the case with anyone . and i 'll meet you tuesday , and we 'll go over your testimony ...
i understand .
we have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps . please do n't , do n't discuss ...

what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party ... ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge ...
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of ...
whose side are you arguing ... ? i thought that you wanted to do something . i do n't have any interest in the woman 's 'estate ' -- no offense , but we all know where the money 's going to ... i have an interest in the hospital ; and i do n't want those bozos working in the same shop as me . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . they turned the girl into a vegetable . they killed her and they killed her kid . you caught 'em . now : how many others did they kill ?
the most respected ...
i read the file . yeah . marx and towler . i know who they were .
do you know who her doctors were ?
her doctors murdered her . they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life . her doctors murdered her .
) i 'm sorry ... ?
her doctors killed her .
uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , dr. gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st. catherine 's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ...
why ?
yes .
you 're going to settle out of court ?
yes .
... and you 're going to do that ?
the archdiocese called , they want to settle ... her estate ...
right . who called ?
they called , they 're going to settle , what i want to do is build up as much ...
... deborah ann kaye ...
... deborah ann kaye ...
i read the hospital report on your client .
that 's perfectly all right . i 'm kind of rushed . do you mind if we walk while we talk ?
i appreciate -- a man as busy as --
yes ? galvin , right ?
dr. gruber ...
well , maybe you better do that , then . you know you guys are all the same . you do n't care who gets hurt . you 're a bunch of whores . you 'd do anything for a dollar . you got no loyalty ... no nothing ... you 're a bunch of whores .
you think i 'm pushy now , wait 'til i get you on the stand ...
you know , you 're pushy , fella ...
then why do n't you testify ?
i do n't owe them a goddamn thing .
i do . who is it ? the doctors . what do you owe them ?
who says that i 'm protecting anyone ?
who are you protecting , then ?
i did n't do it , mister .
who put my client in the hospital for life .
and ask me what ?
i can subpoena you , you know . i can get you up there on the stand .
then why are n't you testifying for their side ?
nothing happened .
you know what happened .
i 've got nothing to say to you .
i want someone who was in the o.r . we 're going to win the case , there 's no question of that . it 's just a matter of how big ...
... you got your doctor 's testimony . why do you need me ?
he 's the assistant chief of anesthesiology , massachusetts commonwealth . he says your doctors , towler and marx , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we do n't know is why . what went on in there ? in the o.r . that 's what we 'd like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang ... someone got distracted ... what ?
no .
i 'll just take a minute . deborah ann kaye . you know what i 'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a dr. david gruber , you know who he is ?
i told the guy i did n't want to talk to ...
i 'm joe galvin , i 'm representing deborah ann kaye , case against st. catherine laboure .
noted . thank you . miss costello was a rebuttal witness . her sole rebuttal was the document , which has been disallowed ...
exception !
overruled ...
i object , your honor ...
mr. concannon ... ?
nothing further , your honor ...
you are n't going to get a mistrial , boy . we 're going back this afternoon , we 're going to try this case to an end . now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail .
damn right i 'm done . i 'm going to ask for a mistrial and i 'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . i 'm going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass .
are you done ?
and do n't give me this shit , 'i was a lawyer , too . ' 'cause i know who you were . you could n't hack it as a lawyer . you were bag man for the boys and you still are . i know who you are .
galvin , look , many years ago ...
no , no , you listen to me . all i wanted in this case is an even shake . you rushed me into court in five days ... my star witness disappears , i ca n't get a continuance , and i do n't give a damn . i 'm going up there and i 'm going to try it . let the jury decide . they told me sweeney he 's a hard-ass , he 's a defendant 's judge . i do n't care . i said , the hell with it . the hell with it . i 'll take my chances he 'll be fair .
listen to me , fella ...
i 'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you 're losing my case for me .
i got a letter from the judge advocate 's office on you today , fella , you 're on your way out ... they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case . now this is it today .
i 'd just like to get to the point , mr. galvin . let 's not waste these people 's time . answer the question , mr. witness . please . would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence ?
if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way ...
yes , mr. galvin ?
i believe that 's the law ... is it not , mr. galvin ... ?
what ?
sustained . yes . the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records .
thank you , your honor , i 'll continue . dr. thompson . did you examine deborah ann kaye last night at the northern chronic care facility ?
do we have time this morning to ... all right . mr. galvin , you want to continue now , or we can resume with dr. thompson this afternoon .
defense ... ?
ready , your honor .
is the plaintiff ready ?
i do n't have a week . this case never should have come to trial . you know better . you 're mr. independent . you want to be independent ? be independent now . i 've got no sympathy for you .
i could subpoena him if i had a week .
that happens .
i had a witness disappear on me .
you should have taken their offer . especially if you were unprepared .
i need an extension for my case .
that 's perfectly all right .
thank you for seeing me .
what is it ?
i 'm sure you would .
and it seems to me , a fella 's trying to come back , he 'd take this settlement , and get a record for himself . i myself would take it and run like a thief .
i was n't disbarred , they dropped the pro ...
... that 's true . sometimes they change , sometimes they do n't . now , i remember back to when you were disbarred ...
... things change .
that 's it ... ? come on , guys ... life is too short ... you tell me if you 're playing 'chicken , ' or you mean it . frank : i do n't think i 'm talking out of school , but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand ... and that 's a lot of money ... and if i may say , you have n't got the best of records .
i know full well she ca n't , frank . you see the padre on your way out and he 'll punch your ticket . you follow me ? i 'm trying to help you .
my client ca n't walk , your honor .
i 'm sure it is , frank : and let me tell you something . if we find it so complex , how in the hell you think you 're going to make a jury understand it ? see my point ? let 's talk a minute . frank : what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ?
this is a complicated case , your honor ...
now , have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother .
i was held up .

' but in their heart they 're saying , 'maybe ... maybe ... '
and are they going to get it ?
jimmy ! that 's why the court exists . the court does n't exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice .
i think i will .

' ... and they got depositions from the nurses , everybody in the operating room , the scrub-nurse ... 'all these guys are god . i saw them walk on water ... '
i 've got my dr. gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ...
forget it . you ca n't prove it . sister 's testimony is no good . jury knows we win she gets the cash .
admittance form is wrong .
you got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance .
we 've got her sister . testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital . this is the point .
i have to try this case . i have to do it , mick . i 've got to stand up for that girl . i need your help . mick , will you help me ... ? will you help me ... ?
frank , but not now . frank . you 're trying to wipe out some old business . but not now . i understand . but you go call 'em back . you call the bishop back .

yes .
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ...
we , yes . yes . they , they present their side , and i get the same chance . to cross-examine ... to ... to ...
what does it mean ? i ... i mean we , you have other tactics ...
i 'm going to see you get that chance .
we just ca n't do it anymore . this is our chance to get away .
... and i have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field ... there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor 's negligent ...
he saw her at the northern care ...
... but dick , he 's looking for two years in tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out . he 's a good man . he 's only trying to do what 's right .
... i understand ...
my doctor told me that i got to move out west ... that 's when we filed in court . we did n't want to sue ...
... i understand ...
i do n't want to leave her . dick ... the , the ... and father laughlin , he said that it was god 's will ...
... fifty thousand dollars ?
you know how beautiful she was ? her husband left her , and he took her kids ... . they , they , they 'd let you die in there . they do n't care . nobody cares . the patriot home , the chronic care ... in arlington ... ? they 'd take her in . perpetual care . they 'd take her . fifty thousand dollars they want . an endowment .
yes . yes , i have .
... you saw her ?
... i know . i went ...
but what can we do ? she do n't know who 's visiting her ...
... i 'm sure you do ...
... we , we love her , dick and me ...
it 's not a good case . it 's a very good case . a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child , she 's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
it 's locked ?
it 's locked .
i 'm ... mrs. doneghy ? i 'm frank galvin ... why did n't you go in ?
you saw kat in new york ... ... or is she in town ? is she in town ... ?
what ?
in new york ?
i just saw her .
she did ?
she told me .
i , what are you talking about ? i talked to her this morning , and she said ...
i spoke to her , and everything is all right .
yes .
a single hour .
i did .
and did you write the numeral `one ' down on the record , standing for one hour ?
yes .
one hour .
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital .
what did she say ?
yes .
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
kathy costello . that 's my maiden name .
these are your initials , 'k.c . ' ?
yes .
yes .
you were the admitting nurse at st. catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night deborah ann kaye was admitted ...
yes ...
kathy price ...
that 's a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law 's a nurse . what did you do , stop ?
i used to be a nurse .
yes .
mrs. simmonds .
mrs ...
who told you that ?
you 're really ... you , are you the one they told me was the nurse ?
thank you .
four . you 're great with these kids .
how old is he ?
uh-huh . my nephew 's going to be staying with us in a few months , so i stopped by .
you live in the neighborhood ?
i 've been meaning to come in a long time .
hi . how are you doing ?
hi .
that 's for sure , frank .
it 's a long road that has no turning .
yeah .
well , well , well . huh ?
thanks , franky .
i want to buy you a drink .
... everybody . mike says , `pat , you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer , and then you go in the back and get laid ? ' `that 's correct . ' mike says , `pat . have you been in this bar ? ' pat says , `no , but my sister has ... ' everyone . buy yourself one too .
another , frank . . . ?
because she was anemic . it 's right there on her chart . her brain was getting less oxygen anyway ...
huh . and why is that ?
yes .
wait , wait , wait , you 're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ... ?
brain damage could have been ... it did n't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two ...
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat ...
we 'd gone to 'code blue , ' we were administering electro ...
what happened in those three minutes ... ?
... we were trying to restore her heartbeat .
what happened in those three ...
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ...
... they start again three minutes earlier ...
as i 've said we had some more ...
four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped . and they resume seven minutes ...
we , we were rather busy ...
but those notations stop ... ... four-and-one-half minutes after deborah ann kaye 's ...
yes , the roving nurse ...
... of the procedures ...
yes .
... there are notations every thirty seconds ...
yes , that 's correct .
you have a record of what happened in the operating room ...
yes .
dr. towler ...
okay . now , so he 's in jail . he , finally , he gets to see the light , he calls up harrington , he says he thinks he made a mistake . as if by magic , charges against him are dropped , he 's released from jail . p.s . he 's fired from the firm , his wife divorces him , he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years . you like that story ?
me , too .
before he can get there here comes this federal marshal , and franky 's indicted for jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he 's gon na be disbarred , his life is over . jimmy , gim me another drink . how are you ?
huh .
that frank was working on . yeah . he thought franky needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so franky finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him ' franky , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he ca n't be comforted . he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they 've disappointed him , he 's going to the judge to rat them out .
the big boy did ... ?
... and he 's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns , harrington , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr. stearns , he tried to fix a case .
yes .
a huge law firm . okay ? they put him in the firm , he 's married , everything 's superb . franky , he 's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire , some fuckin ' place , 'you must drop by with pat and me ... ' okay ... ?
should i ?
stearns , harrington , you know who that is ?
so far you 're great . you got a cigarette ?
how 'm i doing so far ?
franky ca n't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he 's going to see you later . i 'm mickey morrissey , we 're supposed to get to know each other .
i 'll give you another complication : he still is .
ah ? that complicates the problem .
i can give you one thing : he was in love with her .
no . we have ways of digging out knowledge . but it takes longer . he is suffering from acute melancholia , together with a guilt complex . he blames himself for what happened to the woman . and we know little of the background .
he wo n't talk .
it is hard to say . six months , at least . perhaps a year . it depends to a certain extent on him .
doctor , how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this ?
no , there 's nothing you have to say to me . i 'm getting out , scottie . for good . i ca n't stay here . i 'm winding up her affairs , and mine . i 'm going to get as far away as i can . probably europe . and i 'll probably never come back . good-bye , scottie . if there 's anything i can do for you before i go ...
i -- i --
he had no right to say that . it was my responsibility . you did n't know her . i should n't have got you involved .
natural fear . her grandmother went insane and took her own life . and the blood is in madeleine . scottie , i ask you to watch her closely .
why did she never tell her daughter ?
her mother told me most of then before she died . i dug out the rest for myself , here .
how do you know all these things she does n't know ?
she is not my wife .
and when she goes to those places ...
nothing .
knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores , or an old house an eddy street , or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor ?
but she does n't know , about her background . she never heard of carlotta valdes .
well , that explains it . anyone could develop an obsession for the past , with a background like that .
great-grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death - was madeleine 's grandmother .
carlotta valdes was what : your wife 's grandmother ?
something else . my wife , madeleine , has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta . she inherited them . never wore them , they were too old-fashioned ... until now . now , when she is alone , she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently , curiously ... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror ... and goes into that other world ... is someone else again .
oh , yes . you noticed the way she does her hair .
but you knew about this .
i did n't know where she was going to lead you .
there are things you did n't tell me .
yes .
that 's carlotta valdes .
you 've done well , scottie . you 're good at your job .
all right . you wo n't know what to look for at first , scottie . even i , who know her so well , can not tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ...
ernie 's .
we 're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we 'll dine at ernie 's first . which is easier ?
how can i see her , to know her ?
scottie , i need a friend ! someone i can trust ! i 'm in a panic about this !
it 's not my line .
i want you .
i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they 're dependable , good boys --
yes , but carefully . i 'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care . scottie --
have you talked to the doctors at all ?
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day . where did she go ? i have to know , scottie . where she goes and what she does , before i got involved with doctors .
well ?
watched her come out of the apartment , someone i did n't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way i did n't know ; and get into her car , and drive out to ... golden gate park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore , the portals of the past . sat there a long time , not moving ... and i had to leave , to got to the office . that evening , when i came home , i asked what she 'd done all day . she said she 'd driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake . that 's all .
where 'd she go ?
more and more in the past few weeks . and she wanders . god knows where she wanders . i followed her one day .
how often does this happen ?
i 'm not making it up . i would n't know how . she 'll be talking to me about something , nothing at all , and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank ... and she is somewhere else , away from me ... someone i do n't know . i call to her and she does n't hear . and then with a long sigh she is back , and looks at me brightly , and does n't know she 's been away ... ca n't tell me where ... or why ...
no .
no , it sounds idiotic , i know . and you 're still the hard-headed scot , are n't you ? always were . do you think i 'm making it up ?
i did n't mean to be that rough .
then you 're of no use to me . i 'm sorry i wasted your time . thank you for coming in , scottie .
i 'd say you 'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist , psychologist , neurologist , psychoanalyst , or plain family doctor . and have him check you both .
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife , what would you say ?
no .
scottie , do you believe that someone out of the past , someone dead , can enter and take possession of a living being ?
someone dead .
from whom ?
i 'm afraid some harm may come to her .
then ?
not what you think . we 're very happily married .
no ... no , thanks . a bit early in the day for spirits . well , i guess that about covers everything , does n't it ? i never married ; i do n't see much of the `` old college gang '' ; i 'm a retired detective -- and you 're in the shipbuilding business . what 's on your mind , gavin ?
would you like a drink now ?
no , acrophobia is n't a crippling thing . it just means i ca n't climb steep stairs or go to high places , like the bar at the top-of-the-mark . but -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars in this town .
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers . and you 've quit the force . a permanent physical disability ?
no , i 'm all right .
should n't you be sitting down ?
i 'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ... the freedom .
like all this .
san francisco 's changed . the things a that spell san francisco to me are disappearing fast .
and you like it .
almost a year .
how long have you been back ?
no . but one assumes obligations . my wife 's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father 's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it , i 'd come back here . i 've always liked it here .
you do n't have to do it for a living .
no , to be honest , i find it dull .
interesting business .
i married into it .
how 'd you get into the shipbuilding business , gavin ?
no . she 's in fine shape . nothing to worry about . but she does n't know . you understand that . she does n't know what she did .
did she hurt herself ?
hello ?
she ... went into the bay .
what happened ?
no , she 's all right . she 's still here . but i 'll get her home soon .
scottie , what happened ? she 's not home , yet .
hello .
too late ... too late ... there 's no bringing her back .
love me ... keep me safe ...
i was safe when you found me , there was nothing you could prove ! but when i saw you again i could n't run away , i loved you so ! i walked into danger and let you change me again because i loved you and wanted you ! scottie , please ! you love me now ! love me ! keep me safe !
i loved you , madeleine .
what are you going to do ?
and the necklace . carlotta 's necklace . that was your mistake , judy . one should n't keep souvenirs of a killing . you should n't have been that sentimental .
some money .
oh , judy ! ! when he had all her money , and the freedom and the power ... he ditched you ? what a shame ! but he knew he was safe . you could n't talk . did n't he give you anything ?
look at the scene of the crime . go on in .
what are you going to do ?
i made it .
we 'll find him .
i do n't know ... switzerland ?
ah , yes ! i was a set-up . i was the made-to-order witness . where is he now ?
your accident ...
and you were such an apt pupil ! what fun you two must have had , playing games with me ! why me ? why did he pick on me ? ! !
yes !
did he train you ? rehearse you ? teach you what to say and what to do ?
why ? since you 'd tricked me so well up to then ? ! ! you played his wife so well , judy ! he made you over , did n't he ? just as i 've done . but better ! not just the hair and the clothes ! the look ! the manner ! the words ! those beautiful phony trances ! that jump into the bay ! i 'll bet you 're really a strong swimmer , are n't you ! are n't you ! !
i wanted to stop it , i ran up to stop it --
took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?
dead . he 'd broken her neck .
and she was the one who died . not you . the real wife . you were the copy , you were the counterfeit . was she dead or alive when you got there ?
yes !
but you knew , that day , that i would n't be able to follow you did n't you . who was at the top when you got there ? elster ? with his wife ?
scottie , please ... !
i 'm going to . it 's my second chance .
you ca n't . you 're afraid !
we 're going up the tower .
no ! let me go !
we 're going up the tower , madeleine .
go up the stairs , judy . i 'll follow .
no !
you look like madeleine , now . go up the stairs .
take me away ...
and i could n't follow her . god knows i tried . one does n't often get a second chance . i want to stop being haunted . you 're my second chances , judy .
-- and wanted to go on loving you . '' and i said , `` i wo n't lose you . '' but i did .
scottie --
... we stood there and i kissed her for the last time . and she said , `` if lose me , you 'll know that i loved you --
so am i , but it has to be done . i have to tell you about madeleine , now .
i 'm scared .
i ca n't do it alone . i need you , to be madeleine for a while . then , when it 's done , we 'll both be free .
why ?
i need you .
no , i do n't want to go . i want to stay here .
madeleine died here .
but why ? why here ?
i told you . i have to go back into the past . once more . for the last time .
scottie , why are we here ?
to complete my cure .
where are you going ?
no , it 's all right .
i feel like driving . are you terrible hungry ?
we 're going awfully far .
oh , yeah . there .
ca n't you see ?
how does it work ?
scottie !
all in good time .
oh ! you 're supposed to fasten it !
i 've got it . he bends down and bites the back of her neck .
i 'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks . and ... let 's see ... to start ...
no , ernie 's is fine .
i 'm suddenly hungry . would you rather go somewhere else ?
too late . i 've got my face on .
that 's what i had in mind .
oh , no . you 'll muss me .
come here .
is that the best you can do ?
mmmm .
well , after all , it 's `` our place . ''
you 've got a thing about ernie 's , have n't you ?
ernie 's ?
wherever you 'd like ...
where shall we go for dinner ?
we tried it . it did n't suit me .
it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck . i told them . i told you .
well ?
all right . then i 'll do it . because i do n't care about me anymore . i just want you to love me .
yes .
the trouble is , i 'm gone now . for you . and i ca n't do anything about it . i want you to love me . if i let you change me , will that do it ? if i do what you tell me , will you love me ?
judy , please it ca n't matter to you ...
ah , no !
the color of your hair ...
yes . yes , i do .
you do n't even want to touch me .
no , it 's you too , judy . something in you .
i know . because i remind you of her . the one that 's dead . and not even that , very much .
judy , i want to tell you : these few days have been the first happy days i 've had in a year .
no , you would n't let me . and i do n't want to go ...
you can .
i wish you 'd leave me alone . i want to go away .
we 'll take it ! will it fit ?
i do n't like it !
judy , you 've got to do this for me ! please !
no , i do n't want any clothes ! i do n't want anything ! i want to get out of here !
judy , it ca n't make much difference to you . i just want to see how you 'd look and i know it wo n't be the same , but --
it 's a horrible idea ! is that what i 'm here for ? to make you feel that you 're with someone that 's dead ?
judy --
ah , no ! ! ! i do n't want to be dressed like someone dead !
judy , i just want you to look nice . and i know what kind of suit would look well on you .
you want me to dress like her ?
but why ?
they 're none of them right .
but i loved the second one she wore . and this one -- -- is beautiful .
i 'm trying to buy you a suit .
scottie , what are you doing ?
no , it 's not right .
but i like that one , scottie .
i want to ! come on !
but scottie , you do n't have to !
there 's ransohoff 's . nothing but the best . come on .
honest ?
okay . now we 're going to buy you some clothes .
yes --
no , there . there 's a good one . do you like that ?
i like that one .
i suppose i could phone the store in the morning , and say i 'm sick .
will you , judy ?
please ! and do n't look at me .
why ? !
no , judy , i 'm not going to move ! please ! stay in the chair !
that 's not very complimentary , either .
no .
why ? because i remind you of someone ? that 's not very complimentary . and nothing would ... happen ...
yes .
as friends ? we 'd just see a lot of each other as friends , and you 'd `` take care of me '' ?
i just want to see you as much as i can !
no ? then what ?
no .
oh , i understand , all right . i 've been understanding since i was seventeen . and the next step is , as long as you 're going to see me tomorrow , why do n't you stay the night .
no , judy , you do n't understand .
oh , well , thank very much . but no thanks .
i 'll take care of you .
and what will i live on ? my oil wells in texas ?
do n't go .
tomorrow m -- but i have to go to work . i 've got a job .
tomorrow morning .
tomorrow night ? well --
can i see you tomorrow ?
thank you again . good-night .
okay .
mmm .
an hour ?
oh , no ! give me time to change and get fixed up !
i 'll get my car and be back in half an hour .
well ... i 've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , i 've been picked up before . okay .
because i 'd like to have dinner with you .
because i remind you of her ?
just dinner .
dinner ... and what else ?
then will you for me ?
no , you do n't owe me anything .
well , i feel i owe you something for all this ...
why ?
will you have dinner with me ?
i told you ! my name is judy barton ! i come from salina kansas . i work at magnin 's ! i live here ! my gosh , do i have to prove it ?
i want to know who you are .
listen , what is this ? what do you want ?
salina , kansas !
but before ! where did you live before ! ? !
i told you ! right here !
no , a year ago ! where did you live a year ago ! ! ?
about three years .
but you have n't lived here long .
it 's a place to live , that 's all .
-- and how you happen to be living here .
just a girl , i work at magnin 's --
who you are --
judy barton .
your name . and --
what do you want to know ?
well ... you do n't look very much like jack the ripper ...
you wo n't have to .
i warn you , i can yell awfully loud .
let me come in .
well , it 's not going to work . so you 'd better go .
you 're not far wrong .
i 've heard that one before , too . i remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with , but she ditched you for another guy , and you 've been carrying the torch ever since , and then you saw me and something clicked . huh !
why ?
you .
what about ?
just let me talk to you .
i 'm not going to hurt you ! i promise ! please !
listen , i 'm going to yell in a minute !
no , please ! i just want to talk to you !
0h , i thought so ! a pick-up ! well , you 've got a nerve , following me right into the hotel and up to my room ! you beat it ! go on ! beat it !
no , i happened to see you come in , and i thought --
do you live here in the hotel ?
no , there are just a few things i want to ask you , and --
is this some kind of gallup poll , or something ?
my name is john ferguson , and --
what for ? who are you ?
could i ask you a couple of questions ?
please . because i love you . he stares at her , sees the pleading look in her eyes , and lets go . she turns and walks away toward the church , slowly , her head bowed . he watches her go and starts to move after her . then slowly , as she goes , her head begins to go up until finally , as she walks , she is staring high above her . and then , suddenly , she breaks into a broken run .
why ?
let me go into the church alone .
i wo n't lose you .
and if you lose me , you 'll know that i loved you and wanted to go on loving you .
yes .
you believe that i love you ?
madeleine ! !
let me go ! let me go ! !
it had to . we 're in love . that 's all that counts . madeleine --
it 's not fair , it 's too late . it was n't supposed to happen this way , it should n't have happened ... !
please let me go .
madeleine --
to the church , i must go there .
where ?
let me go .
why ?
you ca n't .
there are things i have to tell you , about how we met , and why we are together . but they can wait . the only important thing now is that i love you and i 'm going to keep you safe .
too late ... there 's something i must do ...
no ... we 're together ...
i love you too ... too late ... too late ...
my love ... because i love you .
not merely as it was a hundred years ago . as it was a year ago , or six months ago , whenever you were here to see it . madeleine , think of when you were here !
yes .
and it 's a all real .
here with you .
i stood alone on the green , searching for something , and i started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , i was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and i fought to wake up ...
go on with your dream . what was it that frightened you ?
no , never ! i 've never been there ! scottie , what is it ? i 've never been there !
madeleine , a hundred miles south of san francisco there 's an old spanish mission , mission san juan bautista . it 's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum . now , think hard , darling . you 've been there before . you 've seen it !
no , never !
you 've been there before . you 've seen it .
it 's all there . it 's no dream .
yes ? ! but --
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old california days , and a saloon ... dark ... low-ceilinged ... with hanging oil lamps .
at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
go on .
there was a village square , a green with trees ... and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister . across the green : a big , grey , wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above ... a small garden , and next to it , a livery stable ... with old carriages lined up inside .
tell me .
but clear ... so very clear ... for the first time ... all of it ...
yes --
it was the tower again ... and the bell , and the old spanish village ...
it was a dream , you 're awake , you 're all right , now . can you tell me ?
i did n't wake him . i do n't want him to know ...
where 's your husband ?
only this far .
no , do n't go away !
i had the dream . the dream came back again ...
why ? what 's happened ?
i should have phoned ... but i wanted to see you ... be with you ...
all the time .
do n't leave me ... stay with me ...
i 'm so afraid ... ... you wo n't let it happen ...
i 'm here , i 've got you ...
i 'm not mad . i 'm not mad . and i do n't want to die , but there 's someone inside me , there 's a somebody else , and she says i must die ... scottie , do n't let me go !
and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if i 'm mad ? that would explain it , would n't it ?
if i could find the key ... find the beginning put it together ...
no !
but i 'm the woman in the mirror !
of the woman in the mirror . would you know her if you saw her ?
no .
a portrait ? do you ever see a portrait ?
this part is dream , i think . there is a tower and a bell and ... a garden below ... but it seems to be in spain ... a village in spain . and then it clicks off , and is gone .
what else ?
no . it 's new and clean , and waiting .
there 's a name on the gravestone .
i know .
how do you know ?
i do n't know . an open grave . i stand by the gravestone looking down into it . and it 's my grave .
where ?
a grave ...
what else ?
no ... it 's in shadow .
would you know the room ?
a room ... there is a room , and i sit there alone ... always alone ...
what do you remember ?
vaguely ...
but the small scenes , the fragments in the mirror : you remember them .
yesterday .
there is so little i know . it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored , and fragments of mirror still hang there , dark and shadowy , reflecting a dark image of me ... and yet not me ... someone else , in other clothes , of another time , doing things i have never done ... but still me ... and i ca n't stop to ask why , i must keep on walking . at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness , and i know when i walk into the darkness , i 'll die . but i 've never come to the and ; i 've always come back , before then . except once .
and you 'll go on saving me ? again and again ?
i 'm responsible for you now , you know . the chinese say that once you have saved someone 's life , you are responsible for it forever . and so i 'm committed . and i have to know .
... somewhere in the light .
home ?
take me away from here ?
no ! please ! please , please , please , please , do n't ask me !
what ? !
no , i ca n't tell you !
what was it inside that told you to jump ?
no !
why did you jump ?
i did n't jump , i fell ! you told me i fell !
when you jumped in the bay , you did n't know where you were . you guessed but you did n't know .
no , do n't ask me !
tell me what it is . where do you go ? what takes you away ?
no ! ... no !
where ?
long ago ...
where were you born ?
when ?
yes ...
have you been here before ?
the tall trees ...
where ?
here with you .
where are you now ?
madeleine !
somewhere in here i was born ... and here i died and it was only a moment for you ... you took no notice ...
no , thank you .
would you like a drink of water ?
no .
no birds live here .
and no birds sing .
only silence . it 's always like this .
do you hear anything ?
knowing i have to die ...
why ?
i do n't like them .
their true name is sequoia sempervirens : always green , ever- living .
of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living .
what are you thinking ?
the oldest living things ?
oh ... some , two thousand years , or more .
how old ?
if i 've been there ? that 's silly ! either you 've been to a place or you have n't .
how can you be sure ?
of course not ! i 'm a wanderer ! i 'd like to go somewhere i 've never been !
do you know where you 're going ?
no ... no , i do n't think that 's necessarily true .
wander separately ? ah , but only one is a wanderer . two , together , are always going somewhere .
do n't you think it 's sort of a waste for the two of us to ...
oh , yes , i forgot : it 's your occupation , is n't it ?
ah . that 's what i was going to do .
no , i just thought i 'd wander .
well ... anywhere in particular ?
no .
shopping ?
i do n't know .
good-bye .
good-bye .
we have .
meet again , sometime .
what ?
i hope we will , too .
the first time i 've been grateful for coit tower .
i could n't mail it ; i did n't know your address . but i had a landmark . i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you .
no ! no , thank you !
would you like some coffee ?
i enjoyed talking to you .
-- talking to you ...
not at all , i enjoyed --
oh , yes ! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you !
you 've nothing to apologize for .
oh , yes . fine . no after effects . but as i remember now , that water was cold , was n't it ? what a terrible thing to do ... and you were so kind ... it 's a formal thank-you letter . and a great big apology .
i wanted to drive you home . are you all right ?
i ... suddenly felt such a fool .
good morning . i worried about you , last night . you should n't have run like that .
oh ! yes . hello .
no ... this is the first time for me , too .
no , never before . i 've fallen into lakes , out of rowboats , when i was a little girl . and i fell into a river , once , trying to leap from one stone to another . but i 've never fallen into san francisco bay . have you ? ever before ?
... falling ... into san francisco bay ?
what ?
will you tell me something ? has this ever happened to you before ?
no ... it 's wrong .
some people prefer it .
one should n't live alone .
that 's a good occupation . and live here ... alone ?
wander about .
i prefer john . there , that 's done . and what do you do , john ?
no , i would n't like that . and after what happened today i should think you could call me scottie . or even john .
i shall call you mr. ferguson .
john . old friends . acquaintances call me scottie .
that 's a good , strong name . do your friends call you john ? or jack .
my name is john ferguson .
no , you are right , i 'm glad you did n't take me home ... i would n't have known you , to thank you ... oh , but i do n't know you ! and you do n't know me ! my name is madeleine elster .
yes , i knew which one it was . it 's out there , now . but i did n't think you 'd want to be brought home that way .
you could have looked in my car . oh , but you did n't know my car , did you ?
i ... did n't know where you lived .
you should n't have brought me here , you know .
oh ! yes ! here !
when you ... there were pins in my hair ...
no .
lucky for me you were wandering about . thank you again . i 've been terrible bother to you .
oh , that 's a lovely spot , is n't it ? i 've never been inside . but it looks so lovely , driving past .
the palace of the legion of honor . the art gallery .
you like it , too .
wandering about .
you 're not . merely direct . what were you doing there ? at old fort point ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to be rude .
i will . you 're terribly direct in your questions .
please drink your coffee .
before ? where ? where had you been ?
oh ... wandering about .
this afternoon .
when ?
where had you been before ?
because i love it so . it 's beautiful there . especially at sunset . ah ... thank you for the fire .
why ?
... old port point ! out at the presidio ! of course i remember ! i often go there !
at ...
where were you ?
oh , of course i remember that ! but then i must have had a dizzy spell , and fainted !
do you remember where you were ?
no ...
you do n't remember .
you ... ... fell into the bay .
why am i here ? what happened ?
what car ?
her car is gone .
in her room ? well , yes , of course if you ask . but it does seem silly ...
would you please go and look ?
and there ! there you see ? her key is on the rack !
oh , no ! she has n't been here at all ! i would have seen her , you know . i 've been right here all the time , putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves !
i saw her come in five minutes . ago .
oh , but she has n't been here today . scottie whirls back on her .
when she comes down , do n't say that i 've been here .
no ... she only comes to sit . two or three times a week . and i never ask questions , you know . as long as they 're well behaved . i must say that i 've wondered --
does she sleep here ? ever ?
oh , it must be two weeks . yes , the rent 's due tomorrow .
how long has she had the room ?
yes , that 's it . sweet name , is n't it ? foreign . but sweet .
carlotta valdes ?
valdes . miss valdes . it 's spanish , you know .
what is her name ?
i ca n't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
please answer my question .
oh , dear ! has she done something wrong ?
oh , i 'm afraid we could n't give out information of that sort . our clients are entitled to their privacy , you know . and i do believe it 's against the law ! of course , i do n't think any of them would mind , really , but still i would have to know who you are , and ask --
would you tell me , who has the room on the second floor in the corner , that corner ?
oh , yes !
yes ... you run this hotel .
is there something i can do for you ?
oh ?
as a matter of fact , i thought i might give it to you .
no , not exactly . want to see ?
what is it , a still life ?
well , it 's a living . but i 'm excited about this .
good . i 've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department .
oh , i 'm having a wonderful time ! i 've gone back to my first love ... painting .
wandering .
what have you been doing ?
naturally .
if you want to . naturally , we wo n't talk about anything you do n't want to talk about .
what i 've been doing ?
oh ... this and that .
fair enough . what 'll we talk about at dinner ?
i just thought if i gave you a drink and fed you some dinner , you 'd be so grateful you 'd take me to a movie .
well , i detected an undercurrent .
all i said in the note was : `` where are you ? '' that does n't sound desperate to me .
what was this desperate urge to see me ?
oh ?
yeah .
did you need it ?
mm . better .
oh ?
around .
where ?
just wander .
since i stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do , you 're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go , these days ?
i did . since when do you go about slipping notes under men 's doors ?
bye-bye !
midge !
mmm , yeah , i guess ...
no , not carlotta . elster 's wife .
carlotta ?
is she pretty ?
think ? well , what do you think ?
i 'm not telling you what i think ! i 'm telling you what he thinks !
and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead , to take possession of elster 's wife ? ah , johnny ! come on !
out !
i know . the one who phoned . your old college chum , elster .
out . i 've got things to do .
who 's the guy , who 's the wife ?
i 've told you enough .
you have n't told me everything .
here you are .
i 'll take you home .
you 'll tell , or you 'll be back in that corset ! come on !
nothing to tell .
for bringing you here . come on , tell !
for what ?
now then , johnny-o ; pay me .
and she died ...
the poor thing ... .
all right , come on . introduce me . where is your hat ?
pop leibel ? sure .
do you know him well ?
wait a minute ! you 're not a detective any more . what 's going on ?
who shot who in the embarcadero in august , 1879 .
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop . what do you want to know ?
who ?
pop leibel .
yeah .
oh ! you mean gay old bohemian days of gay old san francisco ! the juicy stories ? like who shot who in the embarcadero august , 1879 ?
not that kind of history . the small stuff ! about people you never heard of !
professor saunders , over in berkeley .
well , who ? come on , you know everybody .
now , that 's the kind of greeting a girl likes . none of this `` hello you look wonderful '' stuff . just a good straight `` who do you know '' --
oh , damn it ! damn it , damn it --
johnny !
this is a cinch . i look up , i look down . i look up --
easy , now .
okay .
step number two .
stop kidding . wait a minute .
now . i look up , i look down . i look up , i look down . nothing to it .
what do you want me to start with -- the golden gate bridge ?
that ! ? !
here , i 'll show you what i mean . we 'll start with this .
i 've got a theory . look . if i can get used to heights just a little at a time ... progressively see ?
how ?
i think i can lick it .
i asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it , and probably would n't . and you 're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out .
my ... the acrophobia .
what .
midge , what did you mean , there 's no losing it ?
sorry , old man . work .
well , i 'm on the bum ; i 'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles . but not tonight . if you wo n't drink with me , i 'll drink alone , tonight .
he 's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink .
could be .
that 's skid row ... is n't it ?
i got a call from him today . funny . he dropped out of sight during the war , and i 'd heard he 'd gone east . i guess he 's back . it 's a mission number .
gavin ? gavin elster ? you 'd think i 'd would . no .
ah , sweet college days . but you 're the one who blew it . i 'm still available . available ferguson . say , midge , do you remember a guy at college named gavin elster ?
three whole weeks .
yeah , i 'm a brute . we were engaged once though , were n't we ?
you know there 's only one man in the world for me , johnny-o .
are n't you ever going to get married ?
normal .
well ?
that 's following a train of thought .
how 's your love life , midge ?
what a pleasant hobby .
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it . he worked it out in his spare time .
uh-huh !
it 's brand new . revolutionary uplift . no shoulder straps , no back straps , but does everything a brassiere should do . it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge .
i 've never run across one like that .
it 's a brassiere . you know about those things . you 're a big boy , now .
oh !
from that music .
i 'm having one now .
have you had any dizzy spells this week ?
to forget ? do n't be so motherly , midge . i 'm not going to crack up .
mmm . why do n't you go away for a while ?
nothing for a while . you forget , i 'm a man of independent means . or fairly independent .
well ? ... what 'll you do ?
ah , johnny-o ...
not with my acrophobia , midge . if i dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up , it could be disastrous !
it 's where you belong .
and sit behind a desk ? chairborne ?
well , you 've got it . and there 's no losing it . and there 's no one to blame . so why quit ?
i know . i have acrophobia . what a disease . a fear of heights . and what a moment to find out i had it .
johnny , the doctors explained --
i know . everybody tells me .
it was n't your fault .
i wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof ... and try to reach out for him .
why ?
i had to quit , midge .
no , it 's your life . but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day .
you sound so disapproving , midge .
what are you going to do ? now that you 've quit the police force ?
what do you mean ?
please ! and what happens after tomorrow ?
how do you know ? personal experience ?
more than you think .
midge , do you suppose many men wear corsets ?
tomorrow ... the corset comes off . and this thing goes out the window . i shall be a free man . i shall wiggle my behind ... free and unconfined .
what 's tomorrow ?
well , you know those police department doctors : no sense of style . ah , tomorrow !
no three-way stretch ? how very un- chic .
it 's this darned corset . it binds . he retrieves the stick .
i thought you said no more aches and pains ?
ow ! !
thank you , mr. leibel . thank you very much .
by her own hand . there are many such stories .
how ?
she died .
by ... no ... the name i do not remember . a rich man , a powerful man . it is not an unusual story . she came from somewhere small , to the south of the city ... some say from a mission settlement ... young , yes ; very young . and she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man ... wait ... wait ... ives ! his name was ives ! yes . and he took her and built for her this great house in the western addition ... and there was a child . yes . this was it . the child .
by whom ?
it was hers . it was built for her . many years ago .
what does a big old wooden house on the corner of eddy and gough street have to do with her ?
yes ... the beautiful carlotta ... the sad carlotta ...
yes , it is . now , i want to look at an evening dress , a dinner dress , black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this ... ... and the skirt out .
well , if it 's absolutely necessary ...
can we have it by tonight ?
well ...
how soon can it be altered ?
oh , yes ! it may need some slight alterations , but it is madam 's size . all right , dear . we 'll have it for you to try in a moment .
i thought so !
yes ! that 's it !
now , judy , it is n't anything to get --
she 'll be out in a moment .
not tweed -- it 's a smoother material , with a larger collar and belted .
but you said grey , sir .
no , that 's not it . nothing like it .
we 're gon na get caught . i know we 're gon na get caught . they were eyeballing my car .
ca n't do what ?
that 's a horrible ugly comment . `` dead whore ? '' she 's a person !
i 'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore .
bullshit it 's not accesory . i did n't do shit . you call the cops , you explain it was an accident ...
they 'll get us on accesory to murder .
do n't touch her . call 911 .
jesus .
i need a drink .
she 's fucking hot !
excellent .
the stripper 's here .
well that 's what i said .
i did n't hear you .
i said how 's it going ?
what did you say ?
what 's that ?
what ?
how ya doing ?
you go home !
go home !
do n't you fucking threaten me - i 'll fucking kill you .
do n't you threaten me you little rat fuck .
you fucking bastard !
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife .
you 're a loser .
if you ever touch my minivan again , i 'll make you sorry . real sorry .
eat my ass !
and you 're a little fucking reject .
about anybody but yourself . you never have .
they 're not on to us . i 'm gon na call boyd .
fucking boyd . that fucking idiot . they 're on to us .
what are you fucking talking about ?
you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
the hell i do n't .
the hell you do .
i have plenty of friends .
you never were a team player . that 's why you never had any friends .
do n't point at me .
you 're not a team player .
what did you say ?
you 're pathetic .
this is pathetic .
it 's sacrilegious .
why ?
why ? !
i do n't know why the floor was wet !
why was the floor wet ?
the floor was wet . she slipped !
playing ?
we were playing ... she slipped ... she hit her head .
she 's dead .
i was just playing ... we were playing just playing around .
franco mother-fucking harris !
tonight we return once again to the cave . tonight we let the monsters out . we fill ourselves with the spirits of genghis khan , joe namath , jfk , paton , lombardi , hemingway ...
i do n't have to ...
name one .
multiple reasons .
oh , and why am i an asshole ?
you 're an asshole .
you 're an asshole adam .
boyd brought up divorce statistics .
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes 85 % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .
because my opinion threatens yours , it 's poorly developed ?
it 's really a stupid opinion . you have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak .
sorry fish .
you 're interrupting a personal conversation .
no first of all . i 'm not in a game mood .
first of all ...
we 're leaving from my house in three hours . if you want to come , get your numbers in order by then .
no . i 'm not boyd . i am not cool at all .
all right . let 's all go back in . adam ? you 're cool right ?
i got children . i 've got a life .
they wo n't figure it out .
i 'm talking about dna samples , fiber optics , search parties , they got infrared scanners , fbi scientists . they figure this shit out . they always figure it out .
it has worked .
i wo n't calm down . i ca n't do this . we ca n't do this . it wo n't work . it will not work .
adam ! calm down .
i did n't do anything ! i 'll turn your pathetic ass in !
i do n't give a damn .
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing adam . we got a rehearsal situation here .
nobody 's smoking anybody out .
they 're on me . they 're smoking me out !
who ? what are you talking about ?
at the seven-eleven .
what ?
i ca n't do this .
what is your problem ?
any time fat boy !
fuck you boyd !
watch the tone fella .
do n't talk to me about character .
lighten up adam . show some character .
would you , shush ? ! these phones are n't secure !
oh i did ? i think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play hamburger helper with the hooker 's head .
you got us into this mess .
what does that mean ?
boyd you idiot , the shit 's coming down !
wrong . that is flat out wrong . hell is for cowards , for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions . this is war . given the circumstances , and given the fact that we are alive and they are not , we have chosen life over death . two wrongs do n't make a right . so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here , not less .
we are all going straight to hell . either hell or prison , whichever comes first .
now i am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing . it 's not . it 's not a good thing . but it was , given the circumstances , the smart play . we did what had to be done . and ... well ... i 'm proud of us . i 'm proud of each and every one of us . we performed . under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations , we stood fast and we delivered . i feel proud .
alright . let 's do it .
i am not flexible on this .
we have to get going .
open the suitcases , unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs .
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ?
that is absolutely not true .
she 's asian . they do n't have jews in asia .
no we 're not . the bodies are all mixed up . we ca n't do this to them .
so that 's what we 're doing .
according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls wo n't rest in peace .
how do you figure ?
no , i mean the suitcases . we ca n't bury them in suticases .
we 've already done this .
we ca n't do this .
what ?
wait . wait a minute .
i 'm not wrecking the transmission !
sun rises at 5:52 .
the reality is , you take away the horror of this situation , take away the tragedy of the death , take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned , beaten , into your head since grade one . what are we left with ? what ? a 115 lb . problem . 115 lbs . that must be moved from point a to point b. now , a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line . but that line exists and i see it.i see that line . trust me . adam . trust me ... i can take care of this .
have you ever done this before ?
someone goes to walmart , gets some buckets , brushes , mops , spic and span , the works .
what about the blood ?
we check out the area and wait for a time when it 's clear .
you do n't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
wrap her up in blankets . bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put her in the car ... done .
she 's got bondage burns on her wrists . there 's blow all over the room , moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion . this room looks like the manson family stayed here a month . micheal goes down , we all go down .
so i did n't fucking do it !
her fucking head was caved in .
it 's a marble floor , we can clean it up .
her blood is all over the bathroom . i 'd say that 's a bit of a dna problem .
nobody knows she 's here . i called her personally . nobody knows .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do n't think at some point somebody might notice that she 's gone ?
we can do this . we can get her out of here .
you do n't just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman .
sure , why not .
bury her out in the desert .
what were we doing officer ? why did n't we help her ? well ... we 're all a bit high , you know , bachelor party , that kind of thing . fisher here is getting married in three days ... beautiful wife ... he did n't have anything at all to do with it ... it was all micheal here ... just micheal ...
i 'm calling the police .
just giving the facts .
just stop .
there 's more .
stop it !
yes sir , there sure is an option here . there are always options .
that is not an `` option . '' there is no multiple choice here .
call the police . okay , that 's one option .
we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom . what options ? call the police .
stop it ! listen to me . let 's just take a second here and take hold of the situation , ok ? let 's just review our options here .
you 're a lying deviant . what did you do ? !
are you sure this was an accident ?
her head 's bashed in and her heart is n't beating .
listen to me . please . everybody just calm down a bit here . okay ... first ... are we sure she 's dead ?
everybody shut up . listen to me !
why ?
we have to call the ambulance .
why ? why ? she 's dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?
calling the ambulance .
just wait a second . wait one second . okay . what are you doing ?
i 'm calling the ambulance .
what do you think you are doing ?
what are you talking about ?
what are you doing ?
what ?
wait !
you do n't know what you 're doing .
she 's got no fucking pulse .
over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life .
more .
i set up fisher with the broker that found his house . took care of that one , did n't i ? prison communications .
you ca n't keep bringing up starbucks . that was your only real hit in like 75 tries .
one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars .
you want to hear me out ?
do n't even start .
i 'm not getting a ticket .
four hours and fifteen minutes . i can make vegas in 3 and change .
what do you mean ? it 's it 's a goddamn mini-mart ? !
there is no candy !
where 's the candy ?
they 're screaming like monsters and it 's giving me a headache . go get some fucking starbursts .
later .
they 're screaming for starbursts .
what ?
honey , go in there and get some starbursts .
they 're singing .
they 're driving me nuts !
do n't snap at them !
where 's the bathroom ?
i got you .
i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , mike tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack ...
jesus adam , can we not get into this now please ?
have you thought about what i said ?
we are . we go to the police . we tell them the truth . now . before they find out . now . we save ourselves .
i do n't think so .
you and i have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent .
what .
i want you to hear me out .
it has to be done .
no way .
what happened ? oh my god ...
either side you idiot . i 'm calling 911 .
y'see ? that 's the real point here . that 's what i 'm driving for , when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave 's are bare . what 's left ? the little trees , the little fellas that the storm did n't see . the tiny little ...
i know ...
if anything ever happens to me ...
i know and i 'm honored ...
i tell mine that they 're little men . i tell them they 're strong . they make me feel joy . i let 'em know . so they really know that i need them just as much . you know . just as much man . and you know , you 're their godfather ...
do n't eyeball your kids .
i wo n't do it .
do n't ever stare him down .
the bucks gon na stop right here . if my son does n't know the six new england states , if he has trouble with geography , i wo n't stick it in his face . i 'll help the little guy . i 'll put him in the car and take him out there . i 'll take him to maine for a big lobster dinner , go skiing in vermont , hot dogs at yankee stadium ... i wo n't stare him down .
then fuck what your father said , cause i 'm gon na tell you right now ... you 'll know what it 's all about , why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning , and the streetlight 's coming through the window and it 's just catching a corner of her face , like a sleeping angel . and her hair smells sweet and she 's your 's . she 's all your 's . do you see where i 'm going here ?
no . i think it 's fucked .
are you solid with that ?
right ! that 's exactly what i 'm saying . my father said , first of all , i 'm your father not your friend . i 'm your father .
no . no . no . it 's what my father said to me . he said it and he meant it ... he said to me ... he said , adam , he said ... he told me and i heard him ... he said ... hell he said so many goddamn things i ca n't remember everything he said for christsake .
they 've all been real times . and as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life , as you prepare for new roles ; father , husband , teacher , you will , as i have , come to except the letting go of of old ways . soon , the mellowing will begin ...
real times .
no ... we want padded chairs ... okay ?
that 's one idea .
i know you 'll be . three hours .
we 'll be ready adam .
tomorrow . we are getting married tomorrow .
so . when is the wedding .
so where 's that leave us ?
and a house . valued at 350 thousand .
well , oh ...
actually , no . adam was switching to a whole life policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam ... and failed to make his last payment ... so his term life lapsed . so it 's value is null and void . now he did have a pension account , worth another 150 thousand .
what does that mean ?
yes money . adam had a five hundred dollar term life insurance policy .
money ?
there 's more .
my god .
lois please .
i will call the police right now if i do n't start getting some answers .
he 's upset about adam . we 're all upset .
shut up boyd ! micheal ?
micheal . tell lois that nothing ...
micheal ? do you have something to tell me ?
i do n't want to hear it from the liar . stick a plug in it boyd . fisher ? what happened in vegas ?
nothing happened in vegas .
you 're a liar . i want to know what happened in vegas .
i do n't understand where this personal attack is coming from ...
do n't sweet lip me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm just gon na let her know i 'm here .
she 's in there !
great . fine . perfect .
is everything okay ?
sweet deal .

she 's still working ?
she 's in the bathroom ... she 's still working .
sin city . devil 's playground . the black bitch . all day every day . where 's tina ?

i 'm not talking to you ?
what 's your fucking point ?
today is the best day of the rest of our lives .
the past is the past . today is the beginning of the rest of our lives .
here 's his head .
i got her arm .
we can take her out to red rock . find some quiet place ... and put her in the ground .
he 's right .
left side .
where do you look ? what side of the neck ?
jack kerouback , herman melville , henry miller and hunter s. thompson . i dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing . so from sun set to sun rise , let me be heard ...
keith richards , dean martin ...
not tonight .
but not tonight .
fine . do n't come crying to boyd . no sir .
i do n't think so boyd .
that 's the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
your investment ideas never work out .
fish ?
no i do n't .
you need help .
i 'm a lifesaver . a lighthouse . up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . i stay lit for you . i stay lit . i do n't go dark . i never go dark !
not a prayer .
and if you think you can fuck me , do n't . cause i 'm fucking insulated fisher . protected . backed up on floppy . do you get me ? i want my fucking money !
you 're sick .
blood money . insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all . in no way have you mentioned that money . and i find that to be very very offensive .
i 'm serious . i 'm the serious one here . i 'm the one making the play . i 'm the indian runner . and i want my money .
i 'm serious .
whatever you say kojak .
fine ? fine what ?
okay fine .
i 'm talking about some bad , bad , very bad things . bad things ! those are bad fucking things !
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ?
you 've got a warped thought process . your brain does n't function properly .
my what ?
i 'm getting really tired of your bullshit .
this is a situation that defies judgement . we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most .
hold on a sec . lois , you sure you would n't rather do this in the morning ?
is n't it a little late ?
that 's right .
now ?
that it was all an accident . she wants to hear it from micheal 's mouth .
hear what ?
good deal . lois just wants to hear it from micheal .
yeah .
i 'm talking about lois having relaxed her anxiety . only deal is ... you still got micheal there ?
what does that mean ?
okay . here 's the deal and it 's a good one . lois is cool . it 's a pacified situation .
you got a nasty side to your thought process .
i do n't know ...
and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think i would hurt lois ? ! she 's the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ?
what does that mean ?
take care of business .
what are you going to do ?
just do it .
i do n't think that 's such a good idea .
after you drop the kids off , take micheal home . put a few drinks in him so he 'll sleep .
suck my ass .
jesus boyd you 're going to o.d . him .
no , but she 's definitely pissed and hostile . and she 's clearly starting to think that 's something 's not right .
does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? did she mention the police ?
regarding what ?
you want to know what you are doing here ? ! you are love pumping . you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies . you are walking the walk . this is it fisher , the real stuff . you love this woman . love is second to nothing . i love you . i love moore . i love micheal . this car is full of love , and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love , man . nothing . we will do what it takes . whatever it takes .
what 's your point ?
exactly ! exactly my point .
i just want to get married .
what you just said . say it again .
what ?
say it again .
i do n't know ! i just want to get married .
yes , you did . now that is the question ! that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . you tell me fisher . what have we done ?
i said , what have we done ?
what is the question you asked me ?
what ?
what did you ask me ?
boyd ... what have we done ?
he is not cracking up .
he 's cracked up .
no easy boyd ! i got a best friend in there in pieces . how about a little sensitivity ?
easy boyd .
he 's having a problem here .
negative . this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior .
shut up boyd .
ok. definitely not cool ! definitely inappropriate behavior here .
no , the problem , as i recall , was the lack of blocking ...
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left ...
you always were a jealous man .
fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey .
however it goes , the point is , nobody says anything to anyone ever . right ? ... right ?
it goes ; `` today is the first day of the rest of our lives . ''
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . adam . your brother and i , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you ... ... are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .
micheal , now is probably not the best time for this .
go ahead .
i 'm talking about prayer .
what kind of words ?
i think we should say some words over the grave .
that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this ... well that 's just more than the man deserves .
so help me god you touch that phone and i bury you with them . surrender is no longer an option . i repeat - it is not an option . is there anyone who does not understand that ?
i 'm calling the police .
all right people . new plan . not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan .
good god ... good god ...
nobody knows she 's here .
what 's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl 's head through a toilet . that 's insane .
oh god . this is insane .
nobody knows .
oh for christsake boyd . somebody must know she 's here .
well we can definitely call the police . that 's an easy call . if we call the police ... what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... they ask us ... what happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , micheal ... your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ...
fuck ! fuck you fucking guys !
shut up .
call 911 .
shut up .
she 's dead . call somebody !
no .
oh , jesus ... call the police .
i ca n't .
she 's all your 's fish . anything you want . happy bachelor party .
or a stock kick of approximately 125 % on shares which are currently sitting around $ 4.38 , or , in plain english ...
we need padded chairs .
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars .
no , i 'm holding for tony . in chairs . keith fisher . okay .
prison communication systems . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
not really . yes , the fisher wedding chairs ...
who 's up for making some real money ?
tony ? this is keith fisher . you 're doing my wedding and i 'm calling about the chair situation . yeah , i 'll hold .
well , i did n't mean it .
you said that boyd .
i love you .
come on tough guy . listen to me . you are going to tell lois that it was all an accident . okay cowboy ? you got me ?
how about my fatburger ?
okay micheal , let 's go . upsy daisy big guy .
give me the valium .
goosed !
stop .
goosed !
stop it !
micheal get a grip . what did you tell her ?
we 're goosed ! goosed by god !
we 're not goosed .
we 're goosed .
he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . before the clock runs out .
easy micheal .
franco harris has a flare for the dramatic . the former pittsburgh steeler running back , beat known for `` the immaculate reception , '' his improbable sixty yard ricochet reception . i say ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate america . harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the park sausage company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting park 's , harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .
you want some breakfast meat . micheal . is that what you want ?
ball park sausages .
the need to know is clear . what did adam tell lois ? that 's the name of the game . what did adam tell lois ? what does lois know ?
you will not screw this up .
this is going to stop right now . right now !
no . i said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel .
you said nobody would miss her .
oh that 's just nothing . that 's just a missing persons thing , that 's all .
not a problem . understand not my words , but follow my orders . follow my orders .
not really , no .
a little gut check time fellas . a time for some serious self-exploration . how do i function ? for real ? no more bullshit . can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas ? when they wo n't play my fucking song ? etc , etc . do you get me ? do you get me ?
that 's what i 'm saying . let the israelis straighten it up . they got plenty of room down there , number one . plus , and this is just a plus , they kind of look alike - the jews and the mexicans . so i think on a whole your average joe mexican is gon na have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing . am i right ?
they need leadership .
the mexicans would love it . they 're dying for a little order down there . they need direction .
lock up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes mexico .
what ?
take mexico .
what ? what 's your point ?
there 's my point exactly .
the israelis can protect themselves . they got the mossad thing happening . mossad 's for real , man . they scalp babies .
now if i 'm the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it 's just a matter of time ... right ? am i right ?
what 's your point ?
i say to myself , look at the map . look what 's all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they 'd throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they 're shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot .
they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .
then what do they have ?
israel does n't have a king .
if i 'm the king of israel , i say to myself , king , i say to myself , king ... take a good look around . what do i see ?
new king .
and what happens when you ca n't ?
i am a lover . in africa , you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night .
you have a king fantasy .
not true .
true .
false .
you hate women .
i do n't hate women .
oh really ? starbucks ?
your ideas never work out .
moore ?
nope .
i never heard that .
you said one in two marriages end in divorce .
the hell i did !
the hell you did n't !
the hell i did !
it 's my fucking opinion .
you 're a fucking moron .
i do .
these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day . fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ?
the rings ?
what ?
may we have the rings please ?
it 's not a question of supposed to , it 's an entirely personal decision ... some do some do n't .
are we supposed to ?
all right then . it 's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything ?
yea ... it 's great ... seems like ... i do n't know you 've got all the important stuff in there .
do you love me ? do you love me ? !
but ...
you put him down or do n't bother coming back .
no ...
if you do n't tie up all the loose ends it 'll never be over .
what ?
you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them . in fact , put moore in the ground too .
i ... liz ... all i ever wanted , was for you to be happy . i just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... i just love you so much ... so much ...
move the bodies ?
move the bodies .
so what do we do ?
the only proof is those bodies .
i do n't know . he could have told someone . he could have , like in the event of his death , somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried .
like how ?
like if something happened to him , he could still get us .
what does that mean ?
he kept saying he was protected .
what money ?
i told boyd two fucking minutes !
no buts . i 've waited twenty-seven years , twenty-seven years i have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle . i will not be derailed ! i will not be embarrassed ! i will not be denied ! i am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water !
but ...
no buts . i told you your friends were jackasses .
but ...
stop ! you stop right here . i do n't want to know anymore . i told you not to do this bachelor party thing . you were warned .
she 's not alone ... she 's ... boyd ... oh god ... he 's gone nuts ... he killed lois and micheal ... it 's all ...
you left a dead prostitute out in the desert ? alone ?
she 's in the desert . she 's out in the desert .

i 'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body .
i 've seen it on television .
that 's absurd .
it 's vile !
time out .
you 're going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on `` oprah '' that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them .
you expect more what ?
he 's weird . and i expect more from you .
he 's a great chef .
why ? what 's his problem ?
he just does n't talk a lot .
he 's weird .
he 's quiet .
he 's weird .
i 've known him since cub scouts .
i just do n't see him in the big picture .
what does moore have to do with your growing ?
it 's not that i do n't like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and ... i just keep myself opening up . crowning . and i want you keeping up with me here .
you do n't like moore ? since when ?
charles moore for instants .
who else ?
i just think that at some point you 're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships ...
i asked you to marry me . i 'm ready for marriage . that 's responsibility . that 's growth .
i 'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with ... about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .
what are you talking about ?
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ?
david boyd is a big sack of hot gas .
he 's my friend . he 's not a moron .
he 's a moron .
he is .
i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this .
it 's a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding .
right before the wedding ?
how do you figure ?
well it 's bad timing .
they organized this , not me . i have nothing to do with it .
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas .
i would n't know .
i 'm just saying i bet those checks all found the mailboxes .
are we going to do this again ?
i bet you did n't forget the bachelor party checks .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry i forgot the tent . i do n't think i forgot anything else .
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .
stop it . i 'm sorry .
do n't you put this on me . do n't do it , do n't do it , do n't do it , do n't ...
what ?
do n't you dare .
because you wanted to . you wanted this to be your wedding not your parent 's .
i 'm working my ass off here . i 've taken care of absolutely everything keith .
how could i know what else i forgot ?
what else have you forgot ?
i 'm not playing around . i forgot .
you ca n't play around with these tent people .
i did n't mean to liz . i 'm sorry .
why did you forget the tent check ?
why what ?
why ?
i think so .
you forgot the tent ?
i think i forgot the tent .
hotel for my parents , the tent , the band , the judge ...
yes .
caterer ?
yup .
florist ?
sent it .
photographer ?
sent it .
the wedding cake check ?
i sent a lot of checks , i 'm not sure what all of them are .
what do you mean , you think so ?
i think so .
did you send in all of the deposit checks ?
i 'm not sure .
why is this kid staring at me ?
i do n't think so .
ca n't we do it on the phone ?
we missed the deadline .
why ca n't we do it through the mail ?
government cutbacks .
this is ridiculous .
ok , ok. you guys just go back in . dad , keep going with the toast , we 'll be right in . go on .
well , i 'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here .
yeah , dad . it 's great .
everything okay ?
i love you so much it hurts . me and your mother marvel at what you have become . you 're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl . i feel it deep inside . a wonderful , magical journey . and i 'm , like i said , just so proud of how you turned out . you go out and knock 'em dead keith . knock'em dead !
i love you dad .
just kills me ...
harry chaplin . `` cats in the cradle . ''
i 'm just so scared of that song . that fucking , `` my son just arrived the other day ... he says thanks for the ball , come on let 's play . i got lots of bills come again next day . he 's grown up just like me ... my boy is just like me . '' gordon fucking lightfoot , cat stevens , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .
you never walked away dad . you could have walked away .
i could have done it better . i 'm a fucking ball-buster i am .
you did all right dad .
i wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you . you know , just to be with you , father and son , before you run off and do your own husband , daddy thing . i 'm just so goddamn proud of you ... god knows i did n't always play it right with you ...
well if you do think about names ... micheal 's a pretty good one ... it 's done me all right .
what is it ?
if i was to think ... if i were to think ... no i mean i have thinked it over ... i have . and without putting a lot of pressure on you i just ... well i just ...
no . no . no . this is my doing . you see i 'm gon na have my wahoo spark for my own . for lois and the kids , for my brother , for franco . i 'm gon na turn myself in . i am all that . i 'm gon na do it for sweet lois .
i appreciate it . i do , but ... maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit .
i 've been looking for that flash and i look and i look and i ca n't find it . and what if i already had it ? you know . my moment ? what if it 's gone ? and i never saw it ? you 're getting married , man . that 's a fucking beautiful thing . just a beautiful thing . i just ca n't stop breaking beautiful things .
i think so .
that 's my point ! you see man ... burning at his absolute . to see all the forces just come together , just right , you know , just in perfect harmony . that 's what i 'm driving at . you get me ?
the wahoo moment ?
the sparkler would burn hot , then hotter , then even hotter ... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect . perfect . it would only last a second , but that second was it . it was it . that 's what dad had us looking for ... you get me ?
the wahoo ?
dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and adam . out back we 'd light 'em up . the three of us . we 'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light . sparks . and dad would be all ... `` get ready '' ... '' watch for it '' ... '' here it comes , '' here comes the `` wahoo '' .
have another drink .
yeah , well , it 's a nasty problem .
i do n't hear it .
yeah . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .
buzzing ?
do you hear buzzing fish ?
at the newsstand on 3rd .
where did you get that ?
just go ahead and say what 's on your mind .
dear god ... i do n't know how to pray .
i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ...
i 'm getting married ...
come on .
go for it .
i 'll take a ride .
so ?
he 's your brother .
i do n't care for him .
lately i 'll just start getting lightheaded , dizzy , and i realize i have n't breathed in like two minutes .
you 're not breathing right ?
i 'm not breathing right .
same alarm clock every morning , same two pops on the same snooze button ... micheal brenn . yes ... yes ... hold your horses . okay . got it . 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343. same shower , towel , toothbrush , razor , hair gel . it 's a fucking epidemic fisher and you better start addressing it . you 're getting married and i 'm not going to candy-coat it . it just gets worse . it 's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body .
i just want her to be happy .
mike brenn . yes . yes . 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. at 29.83 at 9. i 'm amazed the windows do n't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed , ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards .
about what ?
it means she 's insecure .
what does that mean ?
just insecurity . nut crunching gut splinters .
i do n't know . she 's really been stressing out .
that 's just insecurity .
yup .
well that ought to be about the end of that .
that 's what i 'm thinking .
i think you 'd make an excellent big brother .
i want a black one . a little black brother . that 's a big problem it seems to me . lack of racial integration . that 's a big one . you think ?
that 's a good one .
i think there 's a lot of truth in that . i 'm gon na pursue some options . i want to join that big brother thing .
yeah ?
where ?
there .
that 's right , `` pup corn . '' doggie treats . little snacks for dogs . he 's figured it out . there is a hole in the market and he 's going to fill it . spends all our money , works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up . after fifteen months , the big day arrives , the first box of `` pup corn '' pops off the belt . he comes running home with that box , pulls us out of school . we all pile into the living room , must be fifty of us , and in comes `` shelmer , '' our 8 year old mutt . `` here shelmer , '' my dad cries . he 's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand , `` here girl . '' this dog will eat anything , she eats rocks , anything . she walk 's up to my dad 's hand , looks down at the little pellet , licks it once , turns around , walks out of the room . shelmer rejected the `` pup corn . '' fifteen months of my dad 's life , right there . not one dog ate pup corn . not one . three months later , `` pup corn '' shuts down . chapter eleven . my father never got over it . never .
pup corn ?
i 'm saying it 's luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he 's paid the dues , he 's ready , does all the market research , picks his shot - `` pup corn . ''
i guess .
yeah . i 'm thinking about micheal 's franco harris fixation . you know how micheal was always harping `` immaculate reception ? '' i 've seen that play . a lot of times ... and i have to say this ... franco was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that 's it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ?
you alright ?
all week long .
did he try to kiss you ?
he said he was the brain trust . said he was smarter than all of us . he started reading `` atlas shrugged , '' staring at himself in the mirror .
my god ...
he came to me early today , was talking about money , insurance money . said he was gon na get what was his .
downstairs in the closet .
where 's boyd ?
maybe go up to the north pole , the arctic . tag polar bears with dart guns . i 've always had a pretty good aim ...
greenpeace ?
greenpeace .
a move ?
i 'm thinking about maybe making a move .
well i do n't have that skill and if i had to guess i would say that in no way did she believe me .
you can tell when people believe you . it 's obvious .
i have no idea .
did she believe you ?
i told her that i have no idea what adam was talking about in that letter .
what ?
the first day .
i got to agree with that .
boyd ... i do n't know man ... it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self-help thing ... you 're all fucked-up in the head .
how do you know she 's dead .
no ... no .
yup .
that ought to be about the end of that .
i do .
liz do you take fisher to be your beloved husband , to respect , honor and cherish him till death do you part ?
you know , darling you ... you send me ... darling you ... you mend me . honey , sing it for judge tower .
oh i know that . how does it go ...
`` you send me . ''
what song ?
we 're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar . acoustic .
okay great . what will that be ?
we do n't think so . i mean , we just want the singing when i come out .
i kind of like `` till death do us part . '' i mean , this is forever . in sickness and in health , through good times and bad . honey , what do you think ?
we do n't say `` love , honor and obey '' anymore . and we do n't say `` till death do us part . '' today we say , `` respect , honor and cherish , as long as you both do love . '' how does that sound ?
okay boys , smile !
a mutant species .
the post-vegas man .
the stone age .
... regression of modern man to his most primitive , ape-like state ...
... embarrassing , shameful ...
... we will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours , no matter how low , how vile ...
well , i just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so i can get the ball rolling .
that 's our plan .
smart . smart . smart . think big picture , take your time . i wish i had .
so where to on the honeymoon ?
we will .
take your time . i wish i had .
we 're in no hurry . i think we 'll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids .
are you guys gon na fill this place with kids ? you sure got room for them .
i love it . i just love , love , love , love it .
i said out of respect . respect for you fisher . for you and your wedding and your beautiful bride . there will be no more rain . you see where i am here ?
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
you see for me it 's over . over baby . i 'm gon na turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect .
i killed my brother !
shut up micheal .
that 's right .
right .
fish , i 'm really sorry . i just ... i owe you man . desert .
fucking desert .
it was an accident !
she 's dead .
drum banging real times .
good times .
it 's a present from my parents .
where 's the camera ?
let me go , don amalio , i 'll tear her apart .
stop this , stop this .
yes , yes .
did n't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding ?
you 'd like me to kill them ?
keep quiet . these miserable brats only get in the way .
then i 'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
no , i do n't want to because they yell . and i 've got news for you too .
give them to refugio .
no , the children sleep with me .
i 'll come to you tonight .
really , don amalio , there 's not much point in making a fuss .
take me there .
that one .
which couch ?
they 're playing games behind the couch ...
what about them ?
enedina and paco ...
what 's that ?
don amalio !
tell me the answer to this ! what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
they 've got a real hen house here ! you ca n't hear yourself speak .
smoking makes me feel ill ? it 's these filthy fag ends . i wo n't mention in this company what 's upsetting you .
no , miss . smoking makes him spit and feel ill .
so you did n't come from the poorhouse !
when i was n't so miserable i used to sell pigs . begging your pardon , i was more honest than my holy mother .
then it 's a respectable house .
lots . it 's got balconies and two big towers .
are there many windows ?
two .
so much the better . we 'll all fit . how many floors are there ?
then you wo n't forgive me ?
you disgust me ... even if what you say is true .
all that i said just now was a lie . i said it so you would n't leave . i only molested you in my thoughts ... i ca n't bear to have you leave me , hating me like this . tell me you believe what i 'm saying and i 'll let you go .
i 've listened to you long enough . let me out .
you must listen to me before you go .
let me pass !
go away ! leave me alone .
think about it . do n't hurry . think it over .
no , it 's true . last night when you were sleeping , i had you all to myself .
you 're lying .
do n't go !
leave us alone , ramona .
you must be out of your mind . i 've been so happy these last few days -- now you 've spoiled it all .
yes , i do n't want you ever to leave this house .
maybe ...
it 's my fault . if i 'd come to see you more often , if i 'd invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .
unfortunately ...
it 's up to you entirely . do n't leave , then ...
uncle , you must n't think that i wo n't be sad to leave you .
no , it is n't that , i can assure you . i would n't be afraid in the face of real danger . i 've proved that to myself . on the other hand , if a stranger visited me simply to say hello , i 'd be alarmed .
was n't that cowardice ?
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism . i wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as i tried to do something about it , i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell .
no , uncle , and now i 'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although i did n't think so at first , you are really a good man .
you must think i 'm mad .
i do n't like masquerading , but as you see i decided to give in to your whim .
how strange you are ! when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused . you seemed almost offended . and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden . thank you , my child !
today i can refuse you nothing .
i should like you to do something for me . it 's an innocent sort of thing but i 'm very set on it .
whatever you like .
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell .
thank you , uncle .
if you like , i will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave .
then it 's penance for you who are going to be a nun ; and for me , who am old , it 's death ...
no , uncle ; ashes mean penance and death .
no , but what a pity life is like that .
you must think i am a monster .
do n't worry . he wo n't be forgotten .
and this innocent child .
his mother wanted to keep him . she came from a poor family . i was in love with your aunt . i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her . that 's why i did n't say anything .
and what do you know about life ? when all is said and done you could n't possibly understand .
evil .
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience . sometimes it 's because of ...
how could anybody behave like that ?
never .
do n't you ever see him ?
yes , it is .
oh , some years ago i heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ?
how did you know about that ?
nothing . i did n't say anything .
what do you mean ?
only because you want it .
you are spoiling me too much . i wo n't know what to do with myself when you 've gone .
i 'm going to make you a nun 's cake . it will make your mouth water .
you see , even the voice .
i know , uncle , you 've told me that already .
how like your aunt you are , even in your walk .
come down .
my maid ramona 's daughter . she 's a little animal .
who is she ?
come down here , you scamp .
in twenty years the grass has invaded everything . there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor . i hardly ever go out .
you 've been neglecting the farm , uncle .
no .
you have no feelings toward ...
to tell you the truth , not very much . i can not lie . i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially , but otherwise ...
did you have so little interest in seeing me ?
no . mother superior told me to come .
was that difficult to get ?
a very short while , uncle . i 've been given permission to stay only a few days .
how long are you staying ?
you 'll think you 're still at the convent .
excellent . what a charming , peaceful place , uncle .
i 'm well ... the bus was late , was n't it ? ... what was the journey like ?
yes , uncle . how are you ?
it 's only that ... it 's all very odd , sir .
do n't lie . you do n't believe me either .
yes , sir .
you believe me , do n't you ?
tell her i lied , that i did n't take advantage of her .
but what can i say to her , sir ?
what for ? she 'll only look at me that way again ... i could n't . you go . perhaps she 'll listen to you . try to convince her .
speak to her again . explain everything to her seriously .
the way she looked at me , ramona ! she hates me now . i think i 've made a great mistake . she 's going away , she 's going away and nothing will stop her .
but sir , what can i say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?
why do n't you speak to her , ramona ? women are good at that sort of thing . think of something that will make her stay a few more days . you are kind , ramona ! speak to her . i know i do n't need to offer you anything , but , if you 're successful in this , i 'll not forget you or your little girl .
just say the word , sir , and i 'll do anything .
yes , yes , but there 's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ?
i 'd be really ungrateful , if i did n't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when i did n't know where to turn .
sit down , woman , sit down . you like me , do n't you ?
what 's the matter ?
sit down , i 'm going to need your help .
i have asked her but she 's ungrateful . sometimes i feel like hitting her . when i talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
why do n't you ask her to stay on for a few days ?
yes , sir . good night .
leave me now . you can go to bed .
i did n't want to do it , don jorge . they made me ...
they told us you 'd be back tomorrow ...
enedina 's going to take a picture . so we 'll have a souvenir .
yes .
is it all right ?
if everybody agrees , but to make a roast takes four hours .
she wo n't even know .
what will the lady say ?
tonight , but i 'll be back tomorrow afternoon .
no , sir , it 's nearly six o'clock . okay , let 's get a move on ! when are you leaving ?
hold on , ramon ! is there time to make another trip ?
that 's good land .
and in the vegetable plot ?
it 's for wheat . we 've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables .
the fields have been left so long ; with a good manuring anything will grow .
have you thought of what you want planted yet ?
good .
that 's it .
that 's fifteen by seven ?
fifteen yards .
how much is that ?
quiet , my dove . quiet , or i 'll ...
ramona ! ramona !
but why ? why ?
he was asking for it .
my god , what have you done to him !
that does n't matter ; i like it .
thank you ; but it 's missing something .
it 's very good .
do you have great devotion for the virgin ?
it wo n't take but a minute . it 's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever . our lady of the helpless granted her a favor .
come on , miss . just so the virgin can be really pretty .
me ?
that 's life . some people are brought together , others are separated . what can we do , if that 's the way it happens ?
you see how much you like her ?
do n't be a fool ! why rush away from something which could n't happen ?
i think i 'd better go tomorrow .
how in hell does it wind up ?
it does n't make any difference what she is : you like her .
she is n't my cousin .
that your cousin is more to your taste .
what are you thinking about ?
you should have enough to do in this house ... come here and listen to this .
i 'm bored . i 'm alone all day and i do n't know what to do .
should n't i be ? you , on the other hand ...
you 're happy , are n't you !
what i do every day , but i want to do it earlier .
what are you going to do ?
if you wake first , wake me up .
run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .
so , ramona !
let her do what she wants . she does n't bother us in any way . she minds her business and we ...
no , not mad at all : she 's rotten with religion .
she 's mad .
it 's viridiana . she 's getting on my nerves .
why the bad temper ?
nothing .
what 's the matter with you ?
why do you say that ? perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous .
not in that way ; you 're always looking for company .
that will teach you not to bother me any more , you son of a bitch .
kill him .
kill him and i 'll tell you . if i do n't keep my word , you can kill me too . there are thousands of pesetas . kill him , idiot !
where 's the dough ?
i do n't want you to untie me . kill him and then i 'll give you the money .
there 's plenty of money in this house . piles of it .
me , rich ? come on !
if you free me , you 'll be a rich man ...
maybe afterwards he 'll let me ...
that 's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used .
i do n't know -- they 've always been there .
these chairs are in good condition . with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable .
you would n't be here otherwise .
why ?
i do n't know ; i ca n't remember . but i 'm sure he loved you .
there are some curtains and drapes , but they 're all very old .
and this chest ?
one should n't be alone the whole time . i 'm not like him , am i ?
i do n't know , sir .
why did he kill himself ?
he was very good . better than some people would think .
why ?
no .
is she coming back ?
she 's left .
and ... your friend ?
you can come and live again in the big house if you want . now that i 'm alone , i can settle down anywhere .
yes . why ?
do you intend to stay here for some time ?
i 'll be ready .
do n't forget the meeting with the lawyer . the car will pick you up tomorrow morning .
do n't worry . nobody 's going to disturb you .
are they going to work here too ?
i 'm not sure yet . i 've had a shock recently , and i 'm only beginning to get over it . perhaps i 'll go back to the convent one day .
is that all you 're going to devote your life to ?
i know perfectly well how little i can do . what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof , some food , and a bit of human warmth .
there 's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others .
they worry me a great deal , and especially because of you .
do they worry you that much , then ?
you wo n't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out .
leave him alone .
what are you doing here ? get out .
i 'm not like you , you have your wife .
i do n't understand how you can like being alone so much .
and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer ? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us , i 'd be an architect now .
i know that you used to work with an architect .
what do you know about me ?
i 'm not interested . do what you think 's best .
but you have a right to let us know what you think .
i do n't know anything about these things , jorge ...
if i wait until tomorrow , it 'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days . when you 're not with your poor people , you 're praying or you disappear , i never see you .
well ... is it so urgent ?
it 's about time we spoke to each other , is n't it ?
jorge . you frightened me . what 's happening to you ?
i 've been expecting you ; i got a letter from the lawyer .
jorge , don jaime 's son , at your service .
are you jorge ?
miss viridiana ...
canelo !
what 's he called ?
and remember , the less he eats , the better he runs .
i was n't thinking of selling him , but if you want ... i 'll leave it to you .
how much do you want for him ?
he 's good at rabbiting and he knows it . when we 're in the country , if he does n't hunt he does n't get fed .
and let him get run over by somebody else ?
then let him go and he 'll follow you .
it 's for people !
he 's lying through his ass !
stop this !
you 'll soon find out , you liar !
right , i wo n't say that , but i still think they 're no use .
do n't say that .
parents ? nobody cares a damn , what 's the use of them !
are your parents alive ?
hold your arm out . you ca n't hope to be cured quickly . you heard what the doctor said . if it had been seen to in time ... this 'll take time . but with the help of god , we 'll pull through .
things seem to be getting better .
how are you today ?
i 'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now , sit down and go on eating . and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock !
they 're varicose veins . it is n't leprosy .
they told me it is n't at the hospital .
are you sure it is n't contagious ?
they 're varicose veins , miss , but some days i ca n't take care of them .
come with me .
where ?
there 's been an accident .
why not ?
you can not leave ...
is anything the matter , mr. mayor ?
how do you do , miss viridiana !
don jaime loved to watch me skip .
i 'll box your ears if you do n't show some respect for the dead ! you must n't play under this tree .
you little liar ! get out of here !
he came in through the cupboard .
he could n't get through the door , then ?
yes -- very , very big !
very , very ?
it 's a very big one .
a black bull !
a black bull came .
do n't invent stories ; go to bed .
i 'm afraid .
why are you crying ?
i ca n't do anything to make you stay ? these people annoy you , is n't that it ?
yes !
you have decided to leave , moncho .
but , miss ...
in you go ! moncho , lead the way ! you stay here .
this louse is looking for trouble .
what 's going on , moncho ?
they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready .
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ?
you are forgiven . goodbye .
forgive me if i have offended you .
are you aware of the pride there is in what you 're saying ?
i have nothing to reproach myself for . all i know is that i 've changed . with all my strength , which is not much , i will follow the road that the lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent .
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something .
a suicide is horrible . i know . but you should have told me .
i had so many things to think about !
ever since yesterday , when we heard by chance about the tragedy , we have been very anxious for you . why did n't you write ? i would have come immediately .
mother .
good morning . you were n't expecting me , were you ?
the retreat will start soon . you can leave tomorrow morning .
i have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance , and he has just sent your dowry . does that mean so little to you , viridiana ?
but why does he want to see me ? he has never bothered about me .
i 'm afraid that his health is not good . he 's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows . you will certainly never see him again .
i do n't want to leave the convent , mother .
in any case he 's asking you to come and stay with him .
i hardly know him . i saw him only once , some years ago . i ca n't even remember him .
all right , mother .
i 've just had a letter from your uncle . he wo n't be able to come when you take your vows .
mother ?
if you want to stay you 'll have to exercise a little self-control , and be a bit more humble to everybody .
i 've had a gutful of this .
would you mind telling me what i did wrong to you to deserve your insults ?
i 'll talk the way i want to . i 've had enough of this .
do n't talk like that !
good , then let 's go !
when you are , miss .
give the little girl to me . come here , sweetheart . are you ready ?
that 's enough . go join the others , and do n't come back here . and you 'll have to control your temper .
ask the priest , miss .
do n't pay any attention to him . it 's very good .
she looks like a sick marrow !
that 's all right ; we all laugh here , but not at you ; i 'll see to that .
i 'm only good at making people laugh .
what about you , manuel ?
right , let 's go . and keep the compliments to yourself . i do n't like them .
she has the face of an angel . what a pity you ca n't see her .
oh , you slept well ; do n't worry .
have i slept long ?
you fainted last night after supper . the master and i carried you here .
what happened to me ?
that will soon pass . it 's nothing .
i have a headache .
how do you feel ?
ah ! pleased to meet you .
welcome , miss . i 'm ramona , don jaime 's servant .
no , i do n't want to .
i 'm going to the hen house . are you coming with me ?
it 's very wicked to spy . why did you do it ?
from the terrace .
how did you see me ?
yes , yes , i saw you !
what ?
could i trouble you for my glass of milk ?
today , a good girl .
good morning , rita . how are we today ?
hello .
hello .
jesus christ . i know who the dominant personality is . lindenmeyer .
i 've discovered something about lindenmeyer'5 maestro teaching tool i thought you should know ... the harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it .
i 'm sorry , i thought you were somebody else .
me ? what did i do ?
you son-ofabitch , i 'm going to kill you .
look , i feel bad about this , so i 'm going to try to look into the programming of his maestro teaching tool for you. ) i 've had one sitting around for years . maybe i can learn something that you 'll find useful .
it 's not your fault . we appreciate you trying .
it was very wellhidden . there was no way to see it until it was too late .
i accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program .
in english , please .
) there is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming . it is thoroughly secured , which is not surprising considering lindenmeyer created it .
can you tell us what 's on the disc ?
) daryl lindenmeyer was only here briefly , one semester at most . but he was singularly the most brilliant student i ever had in a classroom . he created programs so beautiful , so lyrical , they were almost like symphonies ...
you already have staked your reputation . mayor bennett and i have been friends a long time . since grimes tried to kill him , it does n't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that sid 6.7 might go after him , too . bennett 's re-election rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose . the fail-safe online , yet ?
do i need to remind you what happened to his wife ? to his daughter ? i will stake my reputation that barnes did n't kill those guards .
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?
barnes would n't kill two innocent guards .
i wish we could hear them .
i do n't know .
why would they be going there ?
madison lives two blocks from their present location .
what are they doing in los feliz ?
but only you will know he 's not human .
there 's already a task force out looking for lindenmeyer . every other officer in the city will be hunting sid right along with you .
yes or no , mr. barnes ?
if you try to run , i 'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
this is the newest technology approved for general implementation . it 's called a locater implant . every parolee gets one . we 're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life .
catch him and your record 's clean .
recognize this ? how would you like your old job back ?
whatever .
you mean a nanotech synthetic organism .
we do n't know how , but sid 6.7 made himself into an android .
why was n't i told ?
my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate .
if you 're lying , i 'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
on my life , i promise you i will .
when this is over , will you get this goddam thing out of my head ?
then i guess we 're even .
she saved your life , parker . she did n't have to , but she did .
you sonofabitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ?
do n't worry , they have no idea where you are .
where 's my gun ?
sid 6.7 is now armed .
their weapons missing ?
officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple ... completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .
fine you want to stay here ?
she was n't part of the deal , cox .
this is the personnel file on the programmer , lindenmeyer . there might be something in it you can use .
what she 's going to do is get in my way .
she 's going to help you understand what makes sid 6.7 tick .
if you can catch him .
jesus christ . can you kill it ?
name was clyde reilly . hardware specialist . letac surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building .
i 've seen worse .
these were taken inside letac an hour ago . pretty pictures , are n't they ?
it 's too early in the morning for me to be cordial . you got any coffee ?
parker barnes , i 'd like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane .
you 're wasting your time . i 'm not going to play any more of your goddam games .
do me a favor keep sending them .
what about them ?
you know those cheesy christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year ?
do n't give up , parker . not ever .
but with the six months off i get for being your guinea pig , i 've only got to survive another 17 years , 5 months , and 23 days .
i 'm getting by .
before you , nobody else had gotten close enough to sid 6.7 to take a shot at him . hell , nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first . new scar you making it okay in there ?
real , my ass . it 's an overblown game . anybody ever catch that fucking psycho ?
you were supposed to act as if everything was real .
he was a computer program for crissake .
what the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for ?
donley started experiencing the attack for real . if i had n't gotten you out , the same thing would have happened to you . you may not believe this , parker ,
why'd.. .you pull me out ?
you all right ?
got it .
give me 30 seconds , then flip every switch you can reach .
i do n't set policy . you have the key ?
why did n't anybody tell me ? !
i need your help --
i think we both know who did . what 's so urgent ?
there is no way parker killed those guards . no way .
captain , i 'm afraid of how smart sid 6.7 is . but i 'm even more afraid of what 's he 's becoming .
you think he 's smart ?
i 'm not sure . my guess is that 's what sid wants us to think .
do n't blame yourself . in your shoes , i do n't think i would have told parker , either . so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality ?
i should have told him .
in other words , we collectively do n't know shit .
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we ca n't be sure .
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping sid , or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach . any idea what sid 's going to do next ?
any sign of lindenmeyer ?
... illegal search of lindenmeyer ' s duplex . eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed . twentyfour citizen complaints . and the calls are just starting to come in ... i forgot what it 's like to have you on the streets .
i understand the risks involved here . but there is nobody better qualified to go after sid 6.7 than barnes . and , there is nobody who knows him better than you . if a situation becomes volatile , you will find a way to quell it . i have complete confidence in you .
the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people 's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .
not if you 're with him every step of the way .
letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .
that 's also where mr. barnes lost his arms to mathew grimes ' booby trap . what 's your point , dr. carter ?
you 're going to put your theories to practice . i 'm sending you into the field .
what 's the assignment ?
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . under the authority vested in me by the president , i 'm giving you temporary reassignment .
ms. deane , you wanted to see me ?
do n't forget , convict , if this psycho is n't stopped , you go right back to rotting in a prison cell .
or what , you 'll authorize my death a second time today ?
this better not be a wild goose chase .
you 're the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to .
you know how much man power you 're talking about ?
sid is smart enough to know you 'd check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he 's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . i do n't know where ...
if i were you , i 'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the biltmore hotel .
enough to level an entire city block .
no , but i 've confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much c-4 is missing ?
it 's already been called off . witnesses confirmed you were n't the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?
call off the manhunt looking for me . i did n't kill the transport guards .
what did you find out ?
trying to find out where the bomb is . where the hell have you been ?
barnes , where the hell have you been ? !
how do you know i wo n't run ?
if sid 6.7 has n't killed you , we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence .
what happens if i ca n't catch him ?
this is a full pardon . it authorizes your immediate release .
not from in here .
think you can do it ?
nobody else ever got anywhere near him . nobody else ... understands him like you do .
only because i got pulled out early .
i watched your simulation , mr. barnes . very impressive . you know , you 're the only one to ever go up against sid 6.7 who is still alive .
neither will the public . the media has caught wind of his pardon . unless mr. barnes starts giving me some tangible results , i 'm going to put him back in his cage .
it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform . i will never forget the first time i saw the photos from the crime scene .
i was assured the problem was corrected .
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world .
lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator is n't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real .
what the hell happened ?
do n't remind me .
barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field , remember ?
what did cox pull him out early for ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
he hears ... everything .
how does he know who i am ?
i understand ... i understand perfectly .
you are to turn over the sid 6.7 program , and all its documentation , for immediate destruction . is that understood ?
i 'm what ? !
you 've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want , lindenmeyer. ) elizabeth deane does not give second chances . neither do i. you 're fired .
i 'm still making adjustments ...
of the six prison inmates you 've tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only mr. barnes is still breathing .
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
you embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?
what i need is a nymphomaniac .
you need a maid .
i know . i 'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . if you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . and bring the sheila 3.2 character module with you ...
amazing . i hate to say it , but it is .
... and you get nanodeath . do n't worry , i 've got a bunch of other ones .
separate the character module from the neural net ...
how do you kill it ?
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and i got my second demo into production , is i 'm a lot smarter than you . i never give my best stuff away .
this is supposed to be years away .
it 's better than real . it 's synthetic flesh . synthetic blood . synthetic organs ... it 's a physiological machine .
it feels so.. .real .
coordinated by polymer neural net .
it 's nanotechnology , is n't it ? machines the size of molecules ...
watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea .
you 're ... such a wimp .
get that fucking thing away from me !
bastard ... sheila , do n't go anywhere . i 'll be right back .
do i get to see it or not ?
i have n't been working on anything .
show 's over unless i get to see what you 've been working on after hours .
hey ! ! !
then fix it .
if i do n't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he wo n't be able to walk when i take him out of vr .
talk so i can understand .
he 's developing a hemisphere imbalance .
turn it down !
i wonder how that ...
show me his physical sensory level .
how should i know ?
what 's wrong with parker ?
i told you this would work.. by setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he 's in virtual reality . he still thinks he 's in the real world .
do n't worry . through me , you will live forever ...
i 'm begging you ... please do n't kill me ! please !
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived . what do you think i 'm doing ?
glad to ...
help me get out of here .
how can i ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time , daryl ?
of course you are .
i am beautiful , are n't i ?
what do you expect me to do , thank him ?
sid no ! ! !
i think i understand what you have in mind ...
you catching my drift ?
all my work is my finest .
she 's some of your finest work , daryl .
i had something a little different in mind . instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly , why do n't you get him to show you what he 's been working on after hours ?
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
which god would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life does n't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .
my god ...
i could n't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . i 'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .
you amped the neural connectors back up , did n't you ? you 're the reason the convict died . you 're the reason i got fired !
it was me , what ?
it was you , was n't it ?
true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime .
all they want to produce around here is mediocrity !
think hard -- it 'll come to you ...
should i have ?
did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away ?
do n't be angry with me , daryl .
you wo n't want to watch . turn around .
what do we do now ?
duck !
then shoot him already .
i could n't tell you .
how 's your pulse ?
lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had ...
where the hell are you going ?
i do n't know .
sid ?
my guess is dead .
lindenmeyer ?
more or less .
... i think so ... you ?
you okay ?
because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what i 'm capable of . and what i 'm not . and better than anyone else , i am capable of stopping sid 6.7 .
that 's why i 'm asking .
you do n't know ?
you 've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped sid 6.7 and you 've got his module . you 're free to go right now . why are you going to do this ?
you mean there 's something you have n't asked me ?
can i ask you something ?
a bomb 's going off tomorrow night , but i have no idea where .
find out anything ?
thanks .
nice work .
i 'm not sure ... on the bridge ... the guy at the payphone ...
see something ?
that , or living through him ...
think he 's keeping track of his creation ?
if we find sid , lindenmeyer wo n't be far behind .
part of him is .
sid 6.7 is n't grimes .
i told you before , grimes liked to be obvious .
the rally 's a little obvious as a target , do n't you think ?
i was wrong . and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid . i should have told you . i wo n't make the same mistake again .
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
you 're not capable of it .
sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .
how did you find out about the toxin ?
you knew the entire time ? can you give me one good reason why i should n't kill you right now ?
he did n't know about the neural toxin . i did .
they 're going to fry me for it , anyway .
we know you did n't kill those guards .
no ! grimes is n't back . he 's only one part of sid . sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was . get a hold of yourself !
grimes is back ! he 's back ! he 's come back ! ! !
if you 're gon na do it , better do it now .
parker - stop ! stop ! do n't make me shoot you
both .
which way ?
authority still makes me nervous .
you could have just flashed him your badge , you know ?
real effective security ...
you like baseball ?
it 's not just sid 6.7 's performances that are increasing . stars need bigger and bigger audiences . whatever sid is going to do next , it 's going to involve media .
i do n't know , yet . what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale , not decreasing . whatever it is , he is n't finished ...
start of what ?
whatever he was doing here was only the start .
i 'm doing the best i can !
what 's the problem ?
tell him .
this is n't a game , parker !
you know i am .
enjoying yourself ?
being on the street 's a little different than sitting in an office all day , is n't it ?
nothing .
what did you do to those people ?
this is my area of expertise .
what the hell 's going on ? !
stop me .
do n't get out of the car .
then why do n't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while ?
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them .
relax . i know what you meant .
dammit , i hate sounding so clinical all the time . all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well , but then i ...
do n't worry about it , all right ?
you know , considering you 've only been out of prison for seven hours , you 're readapting quite well . wait , i did n't mean that the way it sounded . i meant ...
i forgot what real coffee tastes like ...
then all we can do is stay mobile and alert . he 's got to make a move sometime , and we 've got to be ready when he does . welcome to police work . you better like coffee .
what i do know is that whatever he 's becoming , sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before .
sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next .
now that he 's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . sid is going to evolve .
what does that mean ?
sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming .
you should practice lying more often . you 're awful at it . where to ?
i told you , it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes .
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ?
thank-you . her name is karin .
she 's beautiful , you know ?
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
why did n't you tell me you had a daughter ?
how did you get your hand out ?
told you i was n't going to go anywhere .
and i 'm going to make sure of it . give me your wrist .
give me a goddam break . i 'm not going to go anywhere alone .
give me your wrist .
in order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick ...
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else .
dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week . kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory . we need to get a look at sid 6.7 's final profile .
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality ?
as a matter of fact , it is .
this is getting you pumped up , is n't it ? this is like the world series to you .
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones .
creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts .
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain .
he 's part of the mix . sid 6.7 is a composite .
hamlet . what 's david berkowitz got to do with sid 6.7 ?
who said that ?
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
i am impressed .
... here on earth to create havoc and terror . i am war , i am death . i am destruction . david berkowitz , 1977 .
i am the demon from the bottomless pit ...
just like they figured there was no better person to catch one ...
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho .
i 've been in prison , remember ?
remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids ' brains ?
i 'm still working on it .
i 'm surprised you did n't write one about me .
maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him ...
this lindenmeyer 's a real piece of work .
you 've studied me , now i 'm studying you . seems only fair , do n't you think ?
checking my pulse . it 's elevated . you enjoy frightening me , do n't you ?
what are you doing ?
do me one favor if you shoot at anything , make sure i 'm nowhere near it .
you 've got a problem with me carrying a gun ?
every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers . stay here .
what happened when he was 17 ?
he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. all he did day and night was play the violin .
learn anything from lindenmeyer 's file ?
i know who would know .
i 've spent over 50 hours interviewing him . charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate . after seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should be done . the question is , what does charlie have to do with sid 6.7 ?
charlie ? you say that like you 're close , personal friends .
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better to improve upon what was already done .
manson did n't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
he was reenacting charles manson 's labianca murders .
do n't worry . if i ca n't handle it , i 'll just kill everybody .
you ready for this ?
fine . never felt better in my life . see , i 'm a good liar .
you all right ?
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it .
it was n't a lie .
every day for the last five years , i told myself someday i would be out here again . no more bars . no more guards . no more fights just to stay alive . every day for the last five years , i told myself that lie .
what you need is a collar .
i do n't need a babysitter .
i do n't have to do anything except survive . and it 's taking everything i 've got just to do that .
i need to know what snapped in you . what made you capable of it . you have to make me understand .
enough !
it was just like before , was n't it ? was n't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you 're after , this time there was only one other person involved .
go to hell .
you did n't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , did n't you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target ...
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
if i had died yesterday , you 'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence .
that 's not true , parker .
you 're not my therapist . you 're hear to study me . face it i 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you .
i know . i was there . i saw the whole thing . if i was your therapist , i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation .
john died .
in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?
a little less than yesterday .
no , i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ?
you actually listen to all those tapes ?
barnes , you 're dead !
now , is that any way to talk to an old friend ?
i really did think i was still in reality . at least , until now . beam me up , scotty !
what are you talking about ?
thank-you , daryl . you had me going for quite a while there , sport .
i 've got some final preparations to take care of checking his watch , he stops suddenly .
are n't you going to watch with me ?
let 's just say i 'm sending a very clear message to his reelection rally ...
you are going after mayor bennett .
there you go best seat in the house .
i thought you liked me being in the audience . do n't you want me to see it ?
it 's really too bad you have to miss the grand finale .
my ... secret .
you ca n't die until you tell me where the c-4 is . where is it ? !
where did you plant the c-4 ? !
let me put it to you this way ... whether i 'm here ... or whether i 'm not ... i 'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
what c-4 ... was cox talking about ?
where did you plant the c-4 ? !
let me put it to you this way ... whether i 'm here ... or whether i 'm not ... i 'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
what c-4 ... was cox talking about ?
why 's that ?
i would n't pull the trigger if i were you
you really are pathetic , you know that ? mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet . he is nothing compared to me .
dead ! you hear me ?
i 'm sorry , the party you 're trying to reach is not answering . is there anyone else you would like to talk to ?
grimes , you 're dead !
now , is that any way to talk to an old buddy ? i mean , just because i 'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me does n't mean we ca n't be friends .
you ... mother ... fucker ! i 'm going to kill you ! ! !
who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands ?
you and me have nothing in common .
i must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . you know , we have so much in common we have such history together i 've been thinking we should become friends .
the only thing i want to hear is your silence .
the symphony of collision ...
performing solo . enjoying the concert so far ?
where 's john ?
at this stage , you either get form or function . you said she wanted function . i gave you function . what are you complaining about ?
do they have to look so ... robotic ?
mr. wallace , i could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow .
as long as they keep overpaying me , i 'll keep overpaying you. ) just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month .
as long as you keep overpaying me , i 'll be the first to go into production on three , and four , as well .
to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes .

i 'm concerned about the driver of the rig .
how do we explain that ? ah , well , you see , wilfred , this is where you 've never been at a < u > pitch < /u > . you see ? his < u > records < /u > say he was in prison ... as they must , as < u > all < /u > the records of group 303 have the men and the women , carried on their roster , as belonging somewhere else , the < u > secrecy < /u > required of ... .
but how do we explain the fact he was in prison ?
< u > fuck < /u > the world . try a ten a.m. < u > pitch < /u > meeting , no sleep , coked-to-the-gills , and you have n't even read the < u > material < /u > .

as we look up , we see the president biting his lip , and continuing with the speech .
cain , mouthing along , with the speech , she looks down , and we see written , on her copy . of his making
the threat of nuc1ear terrorism has been quelled . we are in < u > contaot < /u > with the albanian premier , who assures me , and this government < u > credits < /u > his assurances , that his country does not wish us ill , and < u > has < /u > not . that the threat which we perceived was not of his wish , or of his making .

buddy , buddy , when ya gon na realize it 's big game hunters that bag the elephants , not retail brokers . i heard this story about gekko ... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the challenger blew up selling nasa stocks short .
just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is . you forgetting something ?

maybe that 's the price , bud , maybe so . it 's gon na be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way , that 's the best thing that can happen to you ... stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life , create , do n't live off the buying and selling of others ...
dad , i 'm going to jail and you know it .

you speak for me , son .
your words , not mine ...
your men ! all my life `` your men '' have been able to count on you ? why is it that you 've never been there for me ?
i 'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning , wanting to know what 's going on , i 'm going to lie to them !
your responsibility , dad , is to present the facts , not your opinions , to the men ... you 're gon na destroy their lives , dad ! do n't do it to 'em . give it a chance . let the membership decide for themselves , dad . please .
... as far as being axed , i 'm still here and as long as i am , i have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members i represent ...
boy , if that 's what you think , i must 've really screwed up my job as a father .
that 's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man 's wallet .
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who ca n't stand that his son 's become more successful than himself .
he 's got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you 're standing naked in the display window of macy 's . he 's using you . only you 're too blind to see it .
i met them before you were born .
dad , you know duncan wilmore , pilot 's union , and toni carpenter , flight attendants ...
... got ta run dad . you stop smoking , you hear ?
yeah , you do that huckleberry . i 'll still be here .
wait ... next week 's booked . let me check with my girl and get back to you on monday .
whatever night you like .
... dad , you should 've been a ceo . how about dinner ?
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you 're never happy 'cause somebody 's always trying to take it away from you . money 's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me ... thanks .

'member that crash last summer ? and the investigation ? well , the faa is gon na rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism . i kept telling 'em it was n't maintenance , it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in cincinnati . and i was right .

50 k do n't get you to first base in the big apple , dad , not any more . i pay 40 % in taxes , i got a rent of 15,000 , i got school loans , car loans , food , park my car costs me 3 bills a month , i need good suits , that 's $ 500 a pop , shoes ...
i do n't get it , you get a scholarship to nyu , you get 35,000 the first year , and 50 last year , where the hell is it ?
dad , it takes time . you got ta build a customer list . i 'm doing it . i could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline .
you get on the phone and ask strangers for their money , right ? you 're a salesman .
look dad , i 'm not a salesman . how many times i got ta tell you i 'm an account executive , and pretty soon i 'm going to the investment banking side of the firm .
you coulda stayed at bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now , 'stead of going off and bein ' a salesman .
coulda been a contender .
i told you not to go into that racket . you could 've been a doctor or a lawyer ,
d.k . -- did n't know -- who i was when the options he bought took a bath . he reneged on me .
speak english will ya .
ah , i had a tough day . some jerk d.k 'd me and i got ta cover his loss .

it 's called pasta now dad , spaghetti 's out of date .
... leave me alone willya . only thing makes me feel good anymore . spaghetti . she makes lousy spaghetti ...

first of all , mr. fox , you ca n't just come barging in here . and what makes you think it 's his birthday ?
... and you 're even lovelier than i pictured . i brought a birthday present for mr. gekko .
what are you doing here ?
hello , natalie , you recognize the voice ? i 'll give you a hint , you 're thinking seriously about marrying me ...
good . then call him back . and call me back . do n't worry .
i do n't know anything !
yes ! read the constitution , it 's all in there . and remember -- you do n't know anything , nothing .
you sure ?
they wo n't . that 's not their jurisdiction .
what if they call him ?
tell 'em your father gave it to you .
what if he asks where i got the money ?
look dixon , calm down ! it 's not illegal to buy stock or to be right . and it 's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment .
i told him i was in the bathroom and i 'd call him right back . what the hell was i supposed to say buddy , you got me into ...
what 'd you tell him ?
... this guy who said he was from the security exchange commission , whatever the hell that is , calls and wants to ask me about that stock i bought ...
no , no dixon , my client wants to buy a large , large block of stock and needs to spread it around . i 'll park some money in your account and if it hits , you get a big cut . i 'm telling you , this is the easiest money you ever made ...
sure , and i 'm never gon na die either , is this one of your chain letter schemes or do i got ta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in northern arkansas ?
it 's ready to take off . i 'd jump all over it if i were you .
so you 're hot on this stock ?
rising profits ... strong balance sheets , good earnings per share .
let 's see , it closed at uh , 41 1/8 ... up a quarter ... very attractive ... about average yield ...
i got this guy who should know tells me buy hewlitt packard but i been burned on tips . what do you think bud ?
like ? uh ... hmmm . well ...
want some ? gordon tells me you 're a very talented broker . what do you like ?
wherever you like , lutece , 21 , the river cafe ... or maybe we can just drive around for a while . work up an appetite .
so , where are we going ?
we are ?
did n't he tell you ? that 's so like gordon . get dressed , we 're going out .
lisa . gordon ? oh , mr. gekko . sure . would you , uh , like to come in ?
hello bud , i 'm lisa , a friend of gordon 's .
you 're just the president of the company , what do you know ? ... come on .
he never told me ...
gekko asked us into the bluestar deal . we 're reviewing the timetables , wan na come ?
sure roger , whatever you want , it 's cool .
alright ... i just wan na slow down bud ... no more calls for awhile , no lunches ... we suspend our business , alright ...
... .relax roget you 're 82m in the account numbers and i 'm the invisible man ... they 're always looking for red flags , gekko 's always getting checked by them , they never come up with anything ... we 're invulnerable on this ...
... got a strange call from the sec . they asked to see my records ... bud , this is a heavy ...
so what 's the problem ?
all right , bud ... let 's do it .
... and you do n't have to put up a dime , roger .
too much to do ... but i 'll walk you out .
more money than you ever dreamed , roger . and the thing is no one gets hurt ... how bout a beer ?
... and if i did , what 's in it for moi ?
relax , roger , everybody 's doing it but you do n't know , you do n't know .
yeah , right ...
who 's listening ? it 's just one college buddy talking to another .
come on buddy , you would n't want to got me disbarred now would you ?
what about you , i hear you guys are handling the fairchild foods merger and it may not be going through . any surprises i have n't read about in the wall street journal ?
okay .
yeah , check out teldar paper , it 's still not over .
so , does `` this guy '' have a tip for an honest lawyer ?
`` what are you thinking ? `` ... that was it . the hours are hell , but the money 's starting to tumble in . i know this guy who 's got an iron- clad way to make money , i ca n't lose and i ca n't get hurt .
what was that ?
nah , she asked the wrong question .
ca n't complain . got a house in oyster bay . market treating you good ? still seeing that sexy french gal ?
well we 're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway . i hear you 're moving up in the world . an associate already . not bad . how 's margie ?
fox , bud d. is this deja vu or has it really been a year . you 're not hitting me up for nyu are you ?
you sandbagged me on bluestar . i guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson , that you can make the tail wag the dog , huh ?
gordon .
hello bud .
dump it .
gordon , it 's two minutes to close . what do you want to do ? ! decide .
are you with me buddy ?
... i ca n't make it tonight .
believe me , buddy , i was gon na discuss this with you at the right time . look , why do n't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight . bring darien ...
obviously ...
the richest one percent of this country owns half the country 's wealth : 5 trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do -- stock and real estate speculation . it 's bullshit . ninety percent of the american people have little or no net worth . i create nothing ; i own . we make the rules , buddy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it ... ... you 're not naive enough to think we 're living in a democracy are you , buddy ? it 's the free market . you 're one of us now ... take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . i got things to teach you ...
how much is enough gordon ?
buddy , it 's not a question of enough . it 's a zero sum game , sport . somebody wins and somebody loses . money itself is n't lost or made , it 's simply transferred from one perception to another . like magic . that painting cost $ 60,000 10 years ago . i could sell it today for $ 600,000 . the illusion has become real . and the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it . capitalism at its finest .
tell me , gordon -- when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ?
it 's all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation ... bud , you 're still going to be president . and when the time comes , you 'll parachute out a rich man . with the money you 're going to make , your father wo n't have to work another day in his life .
if these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . my father worked at bluestar for twenty-four years . i gave 'em my word .
because it 's wreckable . i took another look and i changed my mind .
why do you need to wreck this company ?
you 're walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .
maybe you ought to read him pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .
last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot . know what happened : he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung .
i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar . why ?
what the hell do you want ?
i 'm sorry , this ca n't wait .
i did n't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning .
sure . what 's worth doing is worth doing for money . it 's a bad bargain where nobody gains . and if this deal goes through , we all gain .
now , wait a minute , dad ...
a pleasure to meet you , mr. fox .
and i 'd like to introduce you to mr. gekko , and his lawyer , mr. salt .
alright ... susan , get buckingham on the box . i want him to look at it . and tell jock taylor at thwick , jensen ... so sport , the falcon has heard the falconer ... tell me more ...
i can talk to these people gordon , they trust me ... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts .
what makes you think you can ?
the three unions . it 's 43 % of bluestar 's operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ 850 an hour , that 's the real hidden value g.g. , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ 350-400 an hour a run , this airline is gon na be the hottest thing since texas air ...
what does that mean ?
gordon , i worked at bluestar , i know my way around , i have friends there ... inside .
i 'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . it 's gon na take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn teldar paper around , what do i need this dink airline for ? i 'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake .
gordon what i want -- and i never asked you for anything -- is to be your co-pilot on this . i want to take this airline , turn it around , and make it work . it 's gon na make us a fortune !
yeah are n't you forgetting something gordon : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ 75 million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility ... ... and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker ...
mixed emotions , buddy : like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers ...
i think i got some friends that wo n't mind making some easy money ...
the art of which is deception . spread the buy orders through different accounts and you wo n't get burned ...
close to two million . but this sucker can go all the way to devon and the nationals .
how much ?
got him at an auction in kentucky .
yeah , i 'm gon na make you rich , bud fox . i 'm gon na make you rich enough you can afford a girl like darien . remember , power is the best aphrodisiac . this is your wake-up call . go to work .
... gordon .
you do n't understand . i want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , do n't care where or how you get it , just get it ... my wife tells me you put a move on darien . here 's some inside info for you . that euroflash gq guy she 's going with 's got big bucks but he 's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so do n't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i 've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . '' i like you sport , i ever tell you that ... gordon , call me gordon from now on .
mr. gekko , i 'm there for you 110 % .
money never sleeps pal . when i came in in '69 , they traded six hours a day , now the clock do n't stop , london 's deregulated , the orient is hungrier than us . just let the money circle the world , sport , buying and selling , and if you 're smart it comes back paying . i just made $ 800,000 in hong kong gold . it 's been wired to you -- play with it . you done good , but you got ta keep doing good . i showed you how the game works , now school 's out .
you 're learning , sport ...
`` all warfare is based on deception ... '' sun tzu says , if your enemy is superior , evade him , if angry , irritate him , if equally matched , fight ... if not , split and reevaluate .
he 's right . i had to sell . the key to the game is your capital reserves . you do n't have enough , you ca n't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs .
but we do n't want to be greedy now , so let 's let him have it at $ 72 .
the break up value is higher . it 's worth 80 .
stick around ... larry , one of my `` gang '' -- bud fox .
i guess i 'll head back ...
allright . wait here ...
sorry , mr. gekko .
... ca n't it wait ? i 'm good for it . ... awright . come out , get the directions from natalie and hurry up .
my firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight , sir , otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow .
you 're walking between the raindrops kid . i expect sir larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now .
... we have 37.2 million invested . at this point , we 're up 3.1 million and some change . if it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill .
i 'll be right there , fix them a drink .
do n't expect to get it all , sport , you 'll burn out . first rule of business is never get emotional about stock , clouds the judgment . where do we stand ?
i got all i could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 march 50 calls . average price of $ 47 a share and $ 4 per contract for the call . i just wish i could 've got more .
what about it ? you work hard . i 'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . and where 'd it get you ? ... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . and he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory ... wake up pal , if you 're not inside you 're outside . and i 'm not talking a $ 200,000 a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , i 'm talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , 50-100 million , a player bud -- or nothing . you had what it takes to let through my door . next question : you got what it takes to stay ... ? ?
what about hard work ?
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying i 'm gon na buy teldar paper ? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it 's time to blow out xyz . you mean that ? i 'm afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and i are gon na have a hard time doing any business ...
follow him ? mr. gekko i ... it 's not what i do . i could lose my license . if the sec found out , i could go to jail . it 's inside information , is n't it ?
wildman 's in town . he just became an american citizen . something big 's about to go down . i want to know where he goes and who he sees . i want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture ...
i do n't understand .
revenge is a dish best served cold ... well , it 's payback time , sport . ... see that building ? i bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . i sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world ... now , it 's a day 's pay ... i had a mole in wildman 's employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired ...
i remember that deal . you were involved ?
sir larry wildman . like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in ... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me . wildman the white knight .
'course . larry wildman . one of the first raiders .
know the name ?
yes ...
the most valuable commodity i know of is information . would n't you agree on that ?
what ? how do you know about my father ?
i guess your father 's not a union representative on that company .
uh , mr. gekko , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on tarafly ... ... about 50 thousand .
yeah ... not bad for a city college boy . bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps ... i just got on the board of the zoological society , cost me a million ; that 's the thing with wasps -- they like animals but they ca n't stand people !
nice club , mr. gekko ...
... finish out the game , bud , push yourself ...
mr. gekko , i do n't think i can ... go on .
... come on sport , you got ta try harder , i need some exercise for chrissake ...
excuse me sir .
... put the rest of it in a money market account for now . i want to see what you know before i invest it ... and save the cheap salesman talk , it 's obvious .
mr. gekko -- thank you for the chance . you wo n't regret this , you 're with a winner .
sure ... relax sport , no one 's gon na blow a whistle . here , is this legal ? ... you wan na put it in my account ?
no sir , that would 've been illegal ...
teldar 's shooting up . buy any for yourself ? bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office .
bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when i left the office . it might spin up to 25 by the bell ...
... for my kid rudy -- 3 years old , electronics freak , got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam . we 're going into a new age pal . so how 's business today .
... i ca n't even see it ...
see this ? can you believe it ? two inch screen ...
nice to see you again mr. gekko .
hi sport .
bud fox , i look at a hundred ideas a day . i choose one .
my home number 's on the back ...
i know ... the decision 'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts . there 's only a small float out there , so you should grab it . good for a five point pop .
how do you know ?
there was a crash last year . they just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit . even the plaintiffs do n't know .
... do n't like airlines , lousy unions ...
a comer . 80 medium-body jets . 300 pilots , flies northeast , canada , some florida and caribbean routes ... great slots in major cities ...
... rings a bell somewhere . so what ?
it 's a dog , what else you got , sport , besides connections at the airport ?
chart break-out on this one here ... uh whitewood-young industries ... low p.e . explosive earnings . 30 % discount from book . great cash flow . coupla 5 % holders . strong management .
so whatta you got for me , sport ? why are you here ?
ca n't tell you that , mr. gekko .
... a cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the 12th man on the deal team ? the last to know ?
... yeah , and we 're working on some other interesting stuff .
... going places , good junk bond department , you got the financing on that syndicam deal .
jackson , steinem ...
so what firm you with , pal ?
i just want to let you know mr. gekko i read all about you at nyu business , and i think you 're an incredible genius and i 've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you ...
within 45 seconds , a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure . has an lcd readout , and it 's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor .
oh no , no ...
so what s on your mind kimosabe ? why am i listening to you ? got to monitor my blood pressure , so whatever you do , do n't upset me .
so you say . nice to meet you ; hope you 're intelligent . like these , how 'd you get these ?
how do you do mr. gekko . i 'm bud fox .
i figure a guy who 's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who 's made some of her own ...
why ?
hi .
get the hell out !
you may not believe this bud but i really do care for you . i think we could 've made a good team ... but that 's how it goes ...
i 'm looking ... and i sure do n't like what i see .
you 're not exactly pure bud , you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ...
you really mean that ? what 'd he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without gordon 's money and seal of approval , i 'm not such a hot investment anymore . you 're just the best money can buy , darien ...
what the hell 's that supposed to mean ?
i 'm not looking to just survive . i 've been doing that all my life .
i can stay with the brokerage firm . and you 're doing fine . we can survive without gordon gekko .
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we 're so close , the town is going to be ours . do n't throw away your future bud !
at least i would n't be pulling the trigger .
do n't cross gordon . he 'll crush you . you 've worked hard to get where you are . if gordon does n't buy bluestar someone else will ; and who 's to say they wo n't do the same thing .
i 'm not gon na let it happen darien .
buddy , it 's not your fault , and it 's not your decision .
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people ...
i 'm sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .
fear . the fear of being poor i guess , just like you , darien ... but that 's all gon na change sweetheart . i 'm catching the express ... ... and you 're going along for the ride .
so did i , till i hit 19 and found i had all the royal habits and no throne . mom got by but i had to go to work just like you . only the skills i had were shopping and making friends . so ... that 's why i do what i do , what makes you tick , buddy ?
... that changes all my plans , i thought you were loaded ...
you 're so naive bud , you do n't even know . your dad took care of you . i might 've been rich when i was a kid ... but my father lost all his money ... in the seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler ...
sure , why not , money 's the sex of the 80 's . i never had it like you when i was growing up , baby , it was n't the upper east side .
get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you 're turning into a yuppie frankenstein , you love money so much .
i love you , baby . did i tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours ?
you think i 'm gon na broker the rest of my life ... i 'm going to be a giant , darien , an entrepreneur in the italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover , shaker .
... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours .
bud , i hate to tell you this but you 're a genius ! darien ... lightning has struck ! the lightbulb has been invented . edison , da vinci , einstein are watching ...
i 'll let you know .
it 's not me i 'm worried about ... you know darien , the only reason we have n't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , i want you , what else is there ... but you , me , the world . ... right here ... make love to me ... now ... stop me if i 'm going too far .
do you think you 're ready ?
that 's right -- one with high yield , rich assets and no downside ...
you got it all charted out do n't you , like a stock projection .
i 'm kidding , i 'm kidding , we 're still young , darien . so what 's money anyway when everybody 's making it , it 's all relative . after all , this is not the house in connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years ... before we slip our two lovely kids , yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise .
let 's get things straight , bud . i 'm not going to take a cut . i worked hard and you ca n't decorate a room in new york for less than $ 100,000 . curtains alone ...
sure ... but your fee ... considering you 're way over budget , should be negotiable .
i 'll bet he 's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . i call it the `` demolished '' look . they 've already heard about it at house and garden and they 're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? i 'd love to have it in my portfolio .
you know , the elevator man could n't believe i paid $ 300,000 to have my walls looking like this , he 's got them for free in brooklyn .
... too perfect ... let 's not even eat . let 's just watch it and think about it .
... is n't it perfect !
you 're not trouble by any chance . are you ?
i do n't .
well , why stop at that ?
... a turner , a perfect canary diaiaond ... a lear jet ... world peace ... the best of everything ...
and what do you want ?
you have modest wants . i like that in a man .
the conference , oh yeah . fine . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .
so , how did your conference go with gordon ?
yeah , almost ...
if i could have anything ... this would almost do .
how would i know ? i once bet a horse . he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five .
he 's not a racehorse , bud , he 's a jumper .
devon ? he looks like seattle slew . what about the triple crown ?
only if i want something bad enough .
you really do believe in destiny ?
so . see you friday .
you may call me a yuppie ... it 's mister yuppie to you .
i guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and ... my first yuppie .
break it .
what if i have a previous engagement ?
oh it 's just a rental . i 'm moving to the east side soon . i 've got a couple of deals brewing with gordon . but that 's just conversation ... what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . friday . cafe . santo domingo .
oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant .
upper west side .
where is it ?
well , if you 're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .
you got it , a great spender of other people 's money .
i gather you 're a decorator .
not really . i 'd say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk tabriz , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in london , a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa ... although ... i do n't know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it 's a sacrilege having that pre-columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray .
boy , i thought gordon was a tough businessman , but somebody 's really taking him to the cleaners here .
sure you could , in wildwood , new jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you would n't have much left over for decoration .
you could have a great beach house for that .
oh really ? well , i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june .
... few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .
i 'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .
stock broker . as in : never have so few done so little for so much . so what do you see in this ?
aha . poet or philosopher ?
destiny took us apart , but i knew it would bring us back together .
oh yes , i remember you .
grand marnier . a romantic and tragic drink .
excuse me .
hello again , i been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks .
oh christ !
he had a heart attack , hon , but he 's okay , he 's at the hospital ...
... janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent ...
bud ! where you been the last two days ?
... how do you know ? you wish ...
you were never that innocent sugarpie .
any better and i 'd be guilty .
morning buddy , you look happy .
great carolyn , doing any better would be a sin ...
how you doing buddy ?
... just kickin ' ass and taking names , mr. mannheim .
you 're on a roll kiddo . enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does .
it 's a winner mr. mannheim , trust me -- buy .
ca n't get a little bit pregnant , bud .
you 're right , mr. mannheim , but you got ta get to the big time first , then you can be a pillar and do good things .
no such thing bud - 'cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what 's going on bud ? do you know something ? remember there 're no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you 're part of something here , bud . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs . do n't sell that out .
mr. mannheim , got a sure thing . anacott steel .
old values . buy .
now that 's a crap company , sure you 'll make money on the takeover rumor , but what 's being created . nothing . no substance behind it .
sleep with me and the secrets of the west are yours .
jesus , ca n't make a buck in this market , country 's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around ... too much cheap money sloshing around the world . the biggest mistake we ever made was letting nixon get off the gold standard . putney drug -- you boys might want to have a look at it .
you got a look in your eye , mr. mannheim ... you got something for the small fry ...
... that `` scum '' built this company up from one plane in thirty years , they made something out of nothing , and if that 's a scum i 'll take one over a rat any day ...
fine , if you do n't want us , stay with the scum in present management -- dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground .
no , it 's a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians did n't have unions . i know what this guy is about -- greed -- he 's in and out for the buck and he do n't take prisoners . he do n't give a damn about northstar or us ...
i beg your pardon . is that a proverb ?
there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know .
frankly , carl , i ca n't see giving much more . if you have any suggestions i 'll be glad to listen .
harold , you do n't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ?
i thought this was an informal meeting . what 's he doing here ?
ooh ooh , tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package . does this mean you 're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ? because , darien , if you 're through with me , you 're through with everything i 'm a part of .
you 're really twisted , gordon . you 're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there 's a poverty that every last dollar in the world wo n't fill .
you and i are the same , darien . we 're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love ... a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
maybe it does . do n't patronize me gordon .
come on , we both like buddy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top ... it does n't fit .
i ca n't ... and i wo n't .
do n't worry sunshine . bud and i had a little talk . we came to an understanding . i want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . okay ?
because i do n't want to see him hurt .
now tell me , why would i want to do that ?
i want to ask you a big favor , gordon . please drop the bluestar deal .
no , are you crazy ? and i do n't want him ever to know . do you understand ? ...
you told him about us ?
it 's over you , gordon .
sorry to hear that . i thought the kid had staying power .
it 's not puppy love , gordon . anyway , buddy and i are splitting up .
so what 's the problem sunshine ? you look like black thursday . bad case of puppy love ?
ca n't blame me for trying . you look as beautiful as that painting i just bought .
those days are over , gordon . they were over a long time ago .
what do you say we go get a suite at the carlyle ? caviar ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times sunshine .
rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor . interesting . you got a card ?
and , i 'm pretty sure we got the beezer brothers out of tulsa coming in with us and i 'm working on the silverberg boys in canada .
hey , the terminator ! blow 'em away ollie .
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from janson , think i 'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the california pensions . we got close to half a million shares in the bag .
he 's flowing , gordo . piece of cake .
he respond to the offer ? what ? what the hell 's cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company 's losing 60 million a quarter ? i guess he 's giving lectures on how to lose money ... if this guy opened a funeral parlor , no one would die , this turkey 's totally brain dead ... well christmas is over and business is business . keep buying . dilute the sonofabitch . ollie i want every orifice in his body flowing red .
you got it , g.g .
yeah , billy , who 's your buyer ? ... no , not interested . ollie , start calling a the institutions , start with marx at janson mutual , then reardon . get me that california retirement money , baby ! and we 're on our way !
done . you 'll hear from my lawyers . 8 a.m. good night .
considering you brought my mother into it , $ 71.50 .
i could break you , mate , in two pieces over my knees , you know it , i know it , i could buy you six times ever , i could dump the stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares . i 'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow , and i 'm expecting your commitment .
you must be wearing a mask you 're laughing so hard behind it larry . let 's cut the `` sir '' crap . correct me if i 'm wrong , but when you took cnx electronics , you laid off 8,000 workers , jessmon fruit about 6,000 , that airline ...
no . this time i 'm in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , gordon . i 'm going to turn it around . you 're getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you 're costing me to buy back the stock , i could modernize the plant . i 'm not the only one who pays here gordon . we 're talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers ...
the same interest as yours larry . money . i thought it 'd be a good investment for my kid ...
congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel .
rarest pistol in the world , larry , a .45 luger . only six were ever manufactured .
we 'll take our chances . nice to see you again , mr. gekko .
listen , you clowns , there 's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline , if you want to be pac-manned and gobbled by atilla the hun be my guest !
you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it 's the first i 've heard of it .
we know what you 're up to , gekko , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead body you ai n't gon na break up bluestar .
if you mean what you say , i think we 're in the ball park . i 'll take it to my people .
cards are on the table . what do you think ?
i 'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days .
are you prepared to put that in writing ?
cause i have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . i 'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut .
with all due respect , mr. gekko , what 's to prevent you from doing the same thing ?
a body . i mean we 're talking major body
what 's that ?
but he still has something mark has n't .
but ?
so why are you dating jonathan ?
yeah
yeah , yeah , ok
doctor ? lawyer ? china lawyer , doctor , i do n't care .
businessman !
businessman ?
yes , i 'm sure . what i need is an older man , something with class , a little style . someone who knows how to treat a lady .
he did ?
oh i do n't give a shit the guy 's a slob . he does n't even know how to spell `lady ' let alone treat me like one . you know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink ?
he still likes you
with mark ?
i saw the greatest movie with mark last night
china . what happened ? china shhh . it 's ok. i missed you so much .
oh mark . it 's ok. it 's ok .
ok toots , i will .
well if you 're in such a rush darling , why do n't you lead the way ?
suffer ? we 're living in america .
yeah well why should i suffer for that ?
i 'm sorry i 'm not that good at languages ok ?
a little what ? china see . you do n't even speak french .
right . china i need a taking care of , not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe ' . i 'm looking for something just a little more in a man . a little `je nes se qua ' .
us is over . you had your chance you blew it .
about what ? about us .
we need to talk . china yeah about what ?
it 's eleven forty-five let 's go
anybody want another drink ?
just give it a break china ok ? china jeez . ca n't even take a joke
well that 's for me to know - but i did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big .
are you sure you would n't like a closer look ?
yes , i guess you 're right
it 's all rather morbid though is n't it ?
would you like a closer look ?
hmm .
yes , it 's always been one of my favorites too .
hi
weird and tiny huh ?
too late for that sir . give my love to the misses . get those bastards !
jenkins . can i get you some help ?
good evening sir .
jenkins !
we 're all here , and ready sir !
have a nice day sir
uh , not today jenkins , i need the fresh air
will you be wanting your wheels today sir ?
allow me sir
thank you
and uh , your nicotine sir
thank you
and your coff - excuse me , caffeine sir
thank you jenkins
your books master loftmore
you do n't happen to have the address do ya ?
can i give her a message ?
a party at a waxwork huh ?
she went to a waxwork party
no ?
no jonathan .
hello , mrs. webster . is china there ?
hello ?
vell . goodnight .
tony and china ?
they seemed , closing by much
two of your friends left earlier mark uh huh .
uh yes , thank you . it was quite enjoyable .
i hope you enjoyed your visit .
uh , wrong picture tony .
velcome to ve vaxverk .
go away .
sarah listen to me .
china
well , it all started when a friend and i
well . .this , is mr. lincoln . and that 's the man i saw at the waxwork .
well ?
who 's is all this ?
if my mother caught me up here she 'd kill me .
big deal !
you do n't understand . i recognized his face now come on .
oh that explains everything .
listen sarah , i think i know what 's going on ok. i went to the waxwork today.i met this man .
you are n't sick ! we 've got to get back . what are you doing !
a little ?
ok , so maybe i was a little over emotional .
that 's not what you said last night .
no , no james , it 's not like that . tony and china , they 're just friends .
no i 'm serious . it 's . it 's just i do n't know i. i 'm looking for something else .
come on .
i do n't know . i really like you and i think you 're very attractive .
no mark . mark why not ?
i know what you mean .
like her ? i do n't know if i ever liked her . it 's just you want what you ca n't get .
then why do you still like her ?
i 'm not kidding . i want to get out of here - now , ok .
wooo . jealously rearing its ugly head .
what ? tony and china , together ?
getting scared ? do n't worry , they 've probably just gone home .
i 've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that .
have n't we been doing our homework .
this . is killer .
must be what we came for . the four stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the waxworks , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms . the four are now roaming around the waxworks individually , with tony encountering what appears to be a tribal indian pointing a knife towards a victim . mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zombie-fied creature . we see china walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman 's mouth . finally , we see tony walking up to a cottage room display .
this time i really do n't see anyone man .
right behind you .
anyone else not coming ?
right .
safety in numbers man .
guys , if i 'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room .
forget her mark , she 's a bitch
i ca n't believe she went out with that monster last night
maybe before the event , never after .
can this be stopped ?
doing what ? sir wilfred tipping the scales . ruining that delicate balance between good and evil . i think that our mr. lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it . there 's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being , containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form , and feeding him the soul of a believing victim , you can bring him back to life !
you get yourself a regular job , as satan 's disciple .
any student of black magic can do it . .most of these books will tell you how ! sarah so what happens when you 've sold out ?
sell my soul ?
if you sold your soul to the devil , you 'd never age either
six six and six
well divide 18 into three
well ?
well , it 's a long story.sir wilfred oh good share . i love them
so mark , what 's so urgent ?
no thank you sir we 're fine .
hi there sarah
sir wilfred , this is sarah brighton . this is sir wilfred .
i 'll think about it . now run along darling .
but mom , i need the caffine - badly
when - you 're a big boy . i mean you know it 's bad for you
mom , when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning ?
do n't be facetious darling . now drink your milk , you 're late for college
oh really ? we 're they `us'es ' or `them 's ' ?
servants . oh is n't it terrible darling , two more people have disappeared
they 're all human beings
one has to keep the distance between `them ' and `us '
mom .
darling ? i hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night . now you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy .
never fear , tony is here . ladies first .
looks a little spooky boys , you think we should do this ?
yes !
come on mark mark ah hell , why not . i 'll get the maid to write the essays
you bet . we all ca n't be such modern people
you guys are being real assholes
save it for the powder room babe , this man is in pain
oh ! the virgin has spoken ! sarah stop it !
stop saying things so loud !
then we both are .
someone crying . a girl . i thought i was crazy .
what ?
no . but once i heard ...
did you ?
a ghost ?
i started seeing things .
what do you mean ?
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away .
so much .
i miss you .
listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely do n't regret ... is the choice . i made to be your mother .
are you mad at me ?
i know he does .
he loves you very much . he just --
yes it is . can we please not do that ? please ? cause it is .
that 's not true .
i think playing in a band called `` bitch '' might put a dent in the whole `` perfect family '' thing .
no , he would n't .
besides , dad would have freaked .
why ?
mom , i 'm sorry . i wanted to tell you . but it never felt right .
that was very good .
i 'm just saying , you 're going to be fine .
of course you will .
i 'll come back all the time .
i know that .
it 's only two hours away .
yes ?
hey .
do you have a scarf ?
no , it does n't ... okay , look , i see what you 're doing here , and that 's , i 'm sorry , but that 's not it . my marriage is fine . i 've had some kind of `` empty-nest '' episode where i saw some things that were n't there . let 's deal with that . i 'm willing to deal with that . i just do n't want to go conjuring problems where none exist .
that ca n't feel good .
that he does n't ... see me , or , you know , that i 'm ... that 's something 's wrong ... with me .
what ?
last year . i drove my car up a tree . nothing serious , this ... ... a minor concussion . but the car looked bad . it could have been bad . i think it scared the hell out of norman .
you were in an accident ?
me ? no . well , in the accident i was injured , but ...
have you been hurt ?
i felt ... pain . that she 'd been hurt by someone . this is great . i 'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my --
what do you think ? guess .
no .
do you ?
she said , `` you know . '' that i know .
i do n't know , i 'm very confused right now .
you 're saying you willed these events to happen ?
maybe . i do n't know . i just know that when all this was happening , i felt , some part of me felt ... alive . like somebody needed me . and the more i reached out to , it , the fuller it became .
you think you influenced her ?
is n't there something called group hysteria ?
your friend saw them .
yes , but ...
whether you imagined it or not , you actually saw and heard things that frightened you ... that gave you reason for concern .
well , that 's what we 're here for .
what 's happening to me ?
i do n't know . my aunt used to use my uncle 's old pajamas and a candle .
how ?
nope .
are you humoring me ?
ca n't hurt . and i think it 's important you find out what she wants .
you think that 'll help ?
try to communicate with her somehow .
what ?
what do you think i should do ?
fine .
um ... i 'd rather not say ... just yet .
do you have any idea who she is ?
pretty . she 's a blond .
what does she look like ?
i saw her in the water . beside me . she was filling the bathtub .
how do you know it 's a she ?
she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio ... she likes rock and roll . angry rock and roll .
mm-hmm .
these are good .
you 're joking .
fireball ?
because , i do n't know , because sometimes ... sometimes i forget things ... and ever since caitlin left , ever since my daughter left for school , there 've been ... i fainted and ... why is this so hard ?
why is he worried ?
no .
do you really think so ?
yes . i 'm sure he 's hoping you 'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .
your husband ?
because he was worried about me .
then why did you ?
i did n't want to come .
mine . his . we both ... thought ...
who 's idea was it ?
the wives .
who 's that ?
well , i 'm glad . pardon my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know .
ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know ... we 're fine .
toward the end . you remember ?
at the party .
there was just ... some tension . you were upset . i remember being concerned .
no . i 'm just not sure what you mean .
for the dupont chair . i swear . i 'm becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst .
well , i do n't think i 've seen you since the reception at dean ackerman 's last year .
uh-huh . what can be ?
i know how hard it can be sometimes .
i 'm sorry ?
wonderful . it 's good to see you two doing so well .
almost .
norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished .
just fine . it 's a lovely party .
how 're you holding up ?
everyone 's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity .
i am .
of course . you must be so proud .
i did n't kill my wife .
give me that shit . your wife .
who ?
i have to go .
oh-kay ...
i do n't know .
when ... when will she be back ?
she is n't here .
well maybe your wife ...
this really is n't a good time .
right . well , i wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh , to the neighborhood . i 'm claire spencer . from next door .
i 'm running late here . i just came back for my briefcase .
um ...
yes ?
i 'm sorry that i frightened you like that . but i was so touched by your concern . i 've been lonely here . perhaps we could be friends .
no . no , i do n't .
you must think i 'm pathetic .
i could n't catch my breath . that 's not a metaphor , that 's ... and i panicked . i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there ... i tried to leave him . went to my mother 's in boston . he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home .
um ... sure .
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you could n't breathe ? that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?
what ?
love .
you 're going to think i 'm crazy or something .
of what ? what were you so afraid of ?
no .
and these roses . they 're much prettier up close .
thank you .
your house is so beautiful .
very much .
would you like some iced tea ?
right . i 'm sorry .
and then you were n't there .
for scaring you like i did . when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day ...
you do ?
i wanted to apologize .
wait ! do n't go ...
oh god . he 's back . i 'm sorry . please forget that i ... i do n't know what i 'm saying . please ...
i 'm sorry . it 's for the flowers . why do n't you ...
this fence ... it 's so ...
i know . and i 'm sorry . i 've been consumed with ... my daughter left ... for school .
i 've never even met you .
that 's not ... it 's not like that .
how ? how can you help me ? with your flowers and your perfect life ...
tell me . i can help you .
that i 'll just ... that one day i 'll just ... disappear .
tell me . please .
i ca n't , no , no , i ca n't ...
what ? what are you afraid of ?
and i 'm afraid . oh god , i 'm so afraid of ...
who ? your husband ?
he 's so ... it 's too much ... and i ca n't ... i ca n't breath ...
i 'm not ...
hello ?
is everything alright ?
i 've seen you . from the window .
um ... yes .
you 're the flower lady .
it 's mrs ... it 's claire ... spencer . from next door . is everything --
who are you ?
biology . she wanted to be a doctor .
what was her major ?
of course .
y'hear anything you 'll let me know ?
i should be going anyway .
they 're calling me in to work .
you must have been very proud .
full scholarships . princeton too . she wanted to stay close .
it 's like that . does n't seem real . no note . nothing . cops say she 'll be back . i just wan na know what happened .
i do n't know .
why are you here ?
well she would n't . he left when she was twelve . never spoke about him after that .
she never mentioned her father .
sounds about right . never understood how a girl that wild got all a 's . sure did n't get it from me . they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young . maddie would n't hear about it .
i 'm not . we ... we met at a party .
you look a little old for a student .
it 's fine .
just plain old coffee . none of that mocha nonsense .
she never mentioned you .
claire .
what 's your name ?
please leave me alone .
no , i do n't .
you know where she is ?
i 'd like to talk to you about madison .
yeah .
mrs. frank ?
i met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night ...
she got it . turned it down .
i 'm not . could n't pick up my cello for weeks .
she 's making this up .
and i kicked ass . my best stuff . then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition ... and i cried .
do we have to ?
we both auditioned for the philharmonic . one cello position open .
stop .
you should have heard her play .
oh god ...
and there 's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish .
we were suite mates .
i came in from my room ...
he was so pissed .
... just so she could cut them off .
i did n't sleep with him .
anyway , claire slept with him ...
he looked like one of the monkees .
we know each other .
this is ...
wow .
trust me , claire . you hear something ... change the subject . you find something ... get rid of it , throw it in the lake . you know what happened . the rest is only details . and no one 's ever glad they got a hold of those . if you want to put this back together ... just let it go .
i do n't know ...
you 've got a beautiful life . and even with this , it 's always been clear that he loves you . i 've come to think that 's all that really matters .
he 's trying to put it behind him , claire . you should too .
i guess not .
what if he was ? do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you 're trying to make a new start ?
jody he was lying .
did he say that ?
but he acted like he 'd never heard of it .
what is it ?
i have an idea . but , i mean , i 'm just making this up ...
like what ?
alight , alright . stay calm . you opened this door . there 's got to be a way that you can close it .
that could take days . i need to do something now . do n't you see ? she wants us dead .
we need help . please let me call the medium .
i ca n't believe this is happening .
i know .
jody , she tried to kill him .
no . she wanted me to know the truth . now that i do ... i think she 's at peace .
you do n't know that . if it 's your belief that gives her form , then you 've got to shut her out . somehow you have to break the connection .
she could have hurt me if she wanted to .
if she was dangerous before --
i do n't know .
what are you going to do ?
how could i expect you to tell me something that i would n't even tell myself ?
no .
i 'm a terrible friend .
all of us .
i got there first . stan covered up the pills and i had it out with norman . he seemed desperate not to lose you . he promised to handle it . and we all let it drop away .
alone ? on a two lane road ? with a ton of valium in your system ?
too late ? jody , it was an accident .
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , stan called from the hospital and it was too late .
i had just been left by richard . i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason , it made me feel better that your life was n't as perfect as it seemed .
relieved ?
partly because i did n't want to hurt you ... but partly ... partly because i was relieved .
why ?
i started to walk over ... but he was n't alone . a blond . i only caught a glimpse . she was young . i should have said something right away . but i did n't .
artsy little village down seven . there 's a guy there who sells my work . i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car ... i saw norman sitting at this little cafe .
adamant ?
i was down in adamant ...
oh god ... you knew .
i 've got to find a bathroom . i 'll call you .
okay . okay .
please .
but claire --
no . jody , listen to me . you have to listen to me . this is not something that i can do right now . whatever it was , it 's gone . i need it to be gone now .
and he 's the real thing . specializes in cases like this , like yours .
hartford ?
yes . now i talked to sela and there 's a guy , this pakistani guy down in hartford ...
did i ?
something was there . you saw it .
nothing . it was n't anything . i 've been on edge lately . maybe since the accident . and i 'd prefer , i really would , to just --
then what was it ?
mrs. feur . she 's alive . i met her . she 's really sweet .
what ?
jody , she 's alive .
does norman know ?
i mess around with this stuff , but i never thought anything would happen .
it 's alright .
i 'm sorry for leaving , but i mean , jesus , claire ...
i think so
are you okay ?
jody , wait .
i have to go .
it 's initials . f is feur . it 's her .
mef ? what 's mef ?
m-e ...
oh ...
shhh .
nothing 's happening .
i do n't know .
we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur . what 's her first name ?
this .
the planchette ?
place your fingers on the planchette .
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ?
sit down here .
no , you 're not . but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly .
wow . i 'm losing it .
i do n't ...
in the window . norman 's at work .
what ?
someone 's there .
please . that 's all i need .
just bought this beautiful antique ouija .
... no ... no ... no ...
telling you ...
jody , no ...
seance .
what ?
know what i think ?
i do n't know . when you say it , it sounds crazy . but what else could it all be ?
you think he killed her ?
you got it .
listen , i 've got ta run . i just thought i 'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out , say thursday morning ?
absolutely .
beautiful thing , alimony . lose a husband , get a car . think it 'll help me pick up dudes ?
it 's niiice .
yep .
oh my god . you bought it .
so you 'll have some later . notice anything ... different ?
thanks , but i 'm fine .
she 's not a psychic . just a very enlightened spirit .
you 're discussing me with your psychic ?
it soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness . sela suggested i bring --
jody --
kambucha mushroom tea ...
what is it ?
wow . got here just in time . i brought you this .
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
well good . so you 're human .
okay , i 'm a little tender .
cause ... your ... only daughter just went away to school ... who you were incredibly close with aaand i 'd be tripping ...
why does everyone find that so surprising ?
you are ?
good . i 'm good .
how you holding up ?
madison !
what ?
mauduh ...
shhhh .
mmmuh ...
it 's true . that 's ... you have to believe me ! oh god , i 'm telling you the truth ! i did what i had to , claire . she was gone . there was nothing i could do for her . i did ... i put her in the lake . i rolled the car in ... and i watched it sink . and i 've lived with that image ever since . i could n't just stand there while everything -- my career , us , everything , just washed away . do n't you see , claire ? she 's doing this ! this is exactly what she wants you to think !
i do n't believe you .
i did not ! i did not kill anyone . jesus . claire , listen to me . i walked in and she was lying there dead . i swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if i had n't stopped by here before school , the painters would have --
do n't i , norman ? you kept the fucking necklace . of a woman you killed !
okay . do n't ... you do n't understand what this is .
she 's out there is n't she ? she 's in the lake .
fine . i 'll do the shopping .
i know .
you do n't have to do that .
i 'm cooking you dinner .
nothing .
what 's that for ?
maybe we can stop there for lunch .
do n't think so .
do you know it ?
huh .
little village down seven . supposed to be charming .
what ?
adamant .
yep . there 's some great places nearby .
look for antiques ...
incredible . we should take a drive before they 're gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
the leaves ...
claire ...
i do n't know , but i am . she was there and then she was gone . i felt it .
how can you be sure ?
she ca n't be here without me .
what ?
she 's gone .
ca n't you see , she 's trying to kill us .
it 's alright .
we have to get out of here .
of course she did , norman . what else could it be ?
we do n't know that for sure .
she did it .
how did she know where it was ?
she was damaged and unstable . the more i tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house ...
get out of my way .
claire ...
you should have tried harder .
i tried to break it off !
i 'm not going to listen to this .
... would do anything just to be around me . and i slipped . god help me , i slipped .
stop ...
and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive ...
leave her out of this !
to caitlin ! !
who ?
that 's not true ! you wanted to quit ! and then when you did , you hated me for it ... so you gave it all to her .
... oh bullshit . you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family ...
i never asked you to quit !
what did you think i would do ? jesus christ ! i gave up my life and my music ...
claire , please do n't ...
do n't touch me . just get away from me . go !
that 's not what i 'm sayi --
so you fucked a student ? !
it was last year . we were having troubles .
i snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . and when i woke up in the hospital ... somehow it had n't . until now .
oh god ...
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her ... in my house .
claire --
i was there .
what ?
`` you know ... ''
stop it !
your wife ...
who ?
i think she 's starting to suspect something .
why do n't you shut up and fuck me , professor .
i do n't like this , this ...
since when ?
it 's too rough .
what 's the matter ?
ow !
would n't go that far .
i take it your not mad at me .
stop it !
it 's madison fra --
... please stop ...
... i 'm positive this time ...
stop ...
i thought it was mrs. feur , but it 's not ...
yes . the ghost .
the ...
it 's her . this is the woman who i 've seen .
no . i 'm afraid to ask what this is about .
not personally .
i may have seen her on campus .
what 's wrong with me ?
sweetheart , it was over a year ago .
but i do n't remember .
it was maybe a week after the accident . we were moving . it was a hard time .
but why ? i ca n't understand how i could just completely --
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio . i took you home .
in the living room ...
a cheap wine glass from the caterers . you started crying . i tried to comfort you ...
i ...
you dropped a glass .
when she said it , there was something familiar ... but no .
you do n't remember ?
you told me that i was ...
we walked all night ...
i felt you ... looking through me ...
you were lost in the music ... eyes closed ... your chest heaving ...
good . you sat in front ... i saw you there ...
you know i am .
are you glad ? i 'm glad .
what ?
call ya later .
yep .
do i have everything ?
really big bed .
no , it 's fine . i 'm fine .
... i 'm pulling up , yuri . i 'll see you for dinner . sure you wo n't stay ?
then where is she ?
i 'm sorry ...
claire , please ...
maybe you 're right . maybe i 'm losing my mind ...
i will not .
keep your voice down .
no ! not sweetheart , no . i believe in what 's happening . i do n't want to , but i do . i guess i was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you .
sweetheart --
norman , this is n't about you . this is something that 's happening to me . it 's not to get even ... and it 's not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not ...
but then you 've been so much better ...
the accident ... ?
ever since the accident i 've been worried that you 'd been unhappy , or ...
sabotage ?
you know what i 've got at stake with this paper . you know that . i ca n't help but think that you 're doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow .
what are you ... ? no .
maybe you resent how busy i 've been .
what ?
jody brought a ouija board and we summoned her .
how did you --
jody and i. and she was there , norman , she was . it scared jody so bad she had to leave .
who did ?
we had a seance .
how do you know this ?
yes . and he 's going to get away with it .
this is the feur thing ?
he killed her . i 'm not crazy . he killed her and --
what are you doing out here ?
no ! and i do n't need a psychiatrist !
are you lonely ?
... and i do n't think i 'm some lonely , middle-aged woman cracking up .
i never said ...
i never said i was n't upset . of course i 'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it was n't some `` symptom '' of something ...
claire , she 's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you were n't thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .
what can it hurt to talk to someone ?
norman ...
harvey says he 's amazing .
i do n't need a shrink .
well , that 's a relief .
there we go .
we 're going to be fine .
i know i 'm not at the center of the bridge .
you 're not at the center .
five minutes ?
restaurant . let them know we 're running late .
what are you doing ?
okay , okay , i 'm sure that i just ...
... like it never even happened ...
... do n't get all ...
when you do this , i swear ...
yes , tonight . we 're going to be --
tonight ?
... since caitlin . you do n't remember this ?
oh .
what do you mean ? claire , we talked about it . you did n't want japanese , i said , our first date since ...
when ?
dinner . with stan and his new girl .
dressed ?
claire , listen to me . i know you 're under some strain . but there 's no such thing as ghosts . they do n't exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and i ... wait , why are n't you dressed ?
she was lonely , i talked to her . norman , i know how it looks , but --
right . and why is she here ? if he killed her , why does n't she haunt him ?
maybe . point is ... not me .
who did ? mrs. feur ?
i did n't do that .
what am i looking at ?
see ?
okay . okay . i 'll bet there 's ... look at this .
she could be out . she could be sick in bed for all we know .
where is she then ?
it 's a ghost .
it 's her ! i 'm telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she 's trying to contact me !
from the sun . it 's a reflection on the glass .
a flare ?
it 's a flare .
no . look ! in the window .
our house .
no , no , no , no . the soil on the shovel , his shovel ... that 's clay . it 's not from here , believe me , i ... all right , look at this .
and that means he murdered his wife ? this is getting ridic --
he did . she 's in the picture . i went over to look and she 's gone . the table was set for one .
what ?
he killed her .
shhhh .
what 's going on , claire ?
get down ! he 'll see .
huh .
oh , right . yes . harvey says the guy 's a sweetheart . would n't hurt a fly .
did you call about the feurs ?
sorry . you understand .
norman , you are so funny about that . no , i did n't .
you did n't ?
what ? no . no .
did you tell her ?
that 's just mean . oh . jody wanted to know if i could get her some .
did n't know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
i 'm so sorry .
`` ... for my father . ''
that 's ...
`` ... of perpetual distances . '' everybody 's checking their shoelaces . pins drop . `` i 'm afraid you 've mistaken me , '' i say ...
oh , no ...
`` ... especially spencer 's theorem ... ''
well , that 's nice .
and he says ... you 'll fucking love this , he says , `` doctor spencer , i am a great admirer of your work ... ''
wow .
he 's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department , so bob shine introduces us ...
you 're kidding .
ohmigod . you 'll never believe ... i saw schumway ...
you know what that does to me .
madame curie , jonas salk , norman spencer ...
yep .
you are so brilliant .
i think so . maybe .
really ?
think i may have cracked it .
i do , i do . i 'm sure i 'm just ... how was your day ?
i 've got the conference next week . i want you to feel safe .
i do n't know . just ... whispering .
what kind of whispering ?
it was there . this angry music all by itself . and i heard whispering .
of course .
no . can you drive me home ? i 'll bring you back in the morning .
did you call the police ?
in the house . i was scared .
what do you mean ? some noises where ?
there were some noises . i did n't want to disturb you .
what are you doing here ?
huh ? absolutely . take your time .
claire ?
no , no . it 's fine .
unless you need me to come home ...
oh .
i 'm stuck here for another couple of hours .
hi .
is it gone ?
nothing . there was ... i thought i saw something .
hurry ...
mmnph .
norman , you have to look at this !
promise ?
look , i 'll call harvey tomes in the psych department , see what i can find out .
i just wish you could have heard her .
it 's what i 've been working for .
i know .
nothing 's going to happen . besides , i have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . i 've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is ...
i 'd never be able to live with mysel --
claire ...
but what if something happens ?
... when tonight they 'll probably be keeping us awake .
that 's not what i 'm sug --
claire , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of --
to make sure she 's all right .
why ?
not like this . we were never like this . i want to go over there . after dinner , we can --
remember how we were ?
i 'm telling you . there was something in her voice ...
honey , they 're young . they 're probably newlyweds .
more or less .
did she say that ?
of him i think .
of what ?
i 'll be there .
after that .
i 'm finished at three . no . squash with stan .
tomorrow .
maybe we should just ...
mmm .
and we moved out here for the quiet .
shhh .
did you ...
yup .
wan na fool around ?
nope .
tired ?
i know .
it 's just us now .
we did .
you did a great job . she 's a good kid .
to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us .
you are ...
to tell you the truth ... i 'm excited .
you know what i mean .
not the focus .
it 's just she 's been the focus for a while .
i am , really .
it 's okay if you 're not .
fine .
how are you ?
no , no . i 'm just about ... there .
if you have to work ...
nice . almost done .
excellent . couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell .
how is it ?
genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms .
whatcha reading ?
three o'clock .
claire ?
yep .
it 's today ?
it 's saturday .
claire , i have to show up for the --
do n't .
alright . i ca n't take the rejection . i 'm going to class .
norman spencer .
when 's she out of here ?
we 'll be quiet . quick and quiet .
she 's awake .
feur , i think . psych department . figures . they 're all psychotic .
what 's their name ?
three weeks .
i think three ...
christ , that 's twice in ... when did they move in ?
: oh , i wish . a woman would n't have screwed over the woman she loved . no , they do n't think that way .
: what do you mean `` they '' are ? are you officially a woman now ?
: well , they are .
: would you stop it !
: no , i said , i hate what i 'm doing to darcy . oh , boy , men are stupider , it 's true .
: what , you 're doing darcy ? since when ?
who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath ... ? they must see what the legacy has wrought - diedre , withered inside herself carlotta , killing and stunting her own flesh and blood ... surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in lashers grasp ... maybe , in death , they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life ... ? !
but it does n't make sense . they - they used lasher ... they conspired with him .
you 've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and rowan together . is n't that right ... ? they 're reaching out to you , rowan !
but why would they do that ... ?
with his hands !
two heartbeats .
two what ... ?
there are two .
i wish everyone would stop commenting on my health . i 'm the doctor .
are you alright ... ? you look pale .
lasher is my legacy - not michael 's . aaron , i 've seen the pain in michael . i ca n't bear to see anymore . he 's not to know . swear to me .
lasher will act , rowan . whatever it is he wants - he 's waited three hundred years to have it . facing him alone ... i do n't like -
but you 've not told michael .
i have seen him again . last night .
i 've grown very fond of you you and michael both .
you 've been shadowing the family for thirty years . it 's only fitting you give one af us away .
thank you for this honor , my dear .
michael - you loved that house as a child . you could work again ! you could make it ours . we 'll sweep out the horror . and lasher with it !
going away does n't mean you leave lasher behind . he was on rowan 's deck - and the plane ... geography seems irrelevant now .
a spacial entity . an organized energy . something that precedes our definition of existence .
then what is he ... ?
many times over the past thirty years . why he shows himself to me , i do n't know but lasher 's not some mindless wraith .
you have to warn her - this second ! i 'm catching the next flight back !
rowan ...
he chose me for rowan -- - when i was a child !
what are you talk -- -
aaron - lieten to me ... it 's been lasher - from the start !
every day twice .
i 'll probably be back in a week ... but i ca n't spend christmas in that house . you 'll check on her - every day ... ?
then tell me . is it lasher ... .
nothing was ever more false .
o n't know what else to do . maybe i just do n't belong in her life . well - i 'm already out of her life .
yes - and you have . do you see ... ? he was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him ... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could ...
`` go back , michael . do what you can ... ''
what have the witches always asked of you ... ?
no ! she 's pregnant , aaron . she 's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this . do n't you think i know she spends half her lite worrying about me ... listening to my heart , are n't you ... ? the timex still ticking ... ?
michael , rowan should -
do n't tell rowan about this .
then focus on how you feel about her . because your feelings define you . take off your gloves , michael .
rowan .
there is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid . what defines you in the landscape , michael ... ? what anchors your life ... ? your work ... ? your creativity ... ?
no scaredy-cats in the talamasca , huh ... ?
a spirit . perhaps evil ... ... and he has come to you- with diedre gone - you 've ... inherited him .
a what ... ?
come . there is a lot to read
i - r saw him as a child . lots of times ... but no one else did .
you sound certifiable . yon know that .
i ask only that you stay here , long enough to be - educated . a few hours .
rowan 's mother died at childbirth . and she does n't have . any family .
with her family . rowan 's mother died yesterday .
how do you know about rowan ... ? i did n't -- - cemetery ... ?
rowan 's already called the hotel , michael . at the cemetery by now , i would guess .
jesus i 've got - to get to the ho --
it 's over a month . the police say it happens all the time .
i 'm sure he 's alright , bea . they 'll find him somewhere .
c'mon now - give a little nod to mayfair tradition .
then you wear it .
'the heir to the fortune must wear the mayfair pendant an her wedding day . ' we should all have to suffer such burdens .
i do n't want it .
always give the crovd a taste , darling . now - ryan said i 'm supposed to make sure -
in the bayou , they have a saying ... 'you choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner . ' darling , i 'd say you 're on a roll .
mm-hmm . seems & lot longer .
you two sees like a perfect fit . only two mounths ... ?
nothing worse than a common tool .
are n't they gauche ... ? those steel things are so - common .
gifford - that box glued to your hands ... ?
he made that quite clear , yes .
i hope ryan explained that if you stay in this town , you 're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life .
i want to see my mother .
rowan - i 'm beatrice maytair . your cousin . deedee ... you'r mother and i - we - we grew up together .
hell - julien believed it ... carlotta too ... and god knows , more than a few of us called her a witch !
gifford mayfair - i 'll cook your tongue on a spit ! witches !
i 'm not saying i believe it ... but i heard it 'nough times to know somebody did . they made a deal with the devil . y'know - `` make us rich '' - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit . and some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door ... '
you babbling that nonsense - now ... ? this is a wedding .
giff - shuttup . you 're mother was a sweet child , rowan ... a lost little girl in a world too full at things
in certain cases , hell is the operative word .
down here . darling , we figure : if you 're taking a trip to god knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party .
i 'm not like you ! i 'm not ! you 're cruel -
did you like it ... ? looking down at graham and knowing what you could do ... ?
but i had to use my hands . none before you could kill with their mind . graham , my dear . your uncle ... ?
you - are - a - murderer .
... and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster . to kill the legacy ! you are the sum of his desires -
you 're mad ! your mind is sick !
and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her ...
enough ! ! !
witches . rowan . that is what we are .
stop it !
just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile !
it wes a dream ... !
lasher touched you and you loved it .
'he ' ... ?
he 's shown himself to you ... on the deck . in the storm .
you have the mayfair eyes . tell me , rowan -- - what have those eyes seen that the mind ca n't fathom ... ?
why are you doing this ... ? handing out these horrors ! why ... ? ! !
antha ... your grandmother ... her life ended there , on the stones . head split open like a melon .
you 're a monster .
she did n't feel them
you kept her in this filth in restraints ... ? .
put your hatred for me aside , so you can clearly see what is ahead-
better than most , i suppose .
you can see well in the dark , rowan .
the lamplight . that 's all .
what is it ... ?
and this - if you decide to take the rest .
eighty million doll -- - ?
other properties as well - here and in europe . and vest holdings - in sugar , oil , gold , electronics . liquid funds over eighty million . tmpcssible to put a figure on it all . all yours now .
i do n't want the -
there are things i have to know !
i 'm tired . i need to rest .
i might as well be rowan smith - or jones ! you cut me off from every -
a mayfair it ever i saw one .
she was alive all these years ... you never let me know her . who gave you that right ... ? !
in the coffin , my dear . where else ... ?
i want to see my mother . where is she ... ?
you came . i 'm your aunt carlotta , my dear .
i 'm coming down there ! ! and it you put my mother in the ground betore i arrive , you 'll wish you 'd never seen my face ! is that understood ... ? !
out of the question rowan , coming here will not change the -
when is the funeral ... ? i am coming to my mother 's funeral ! !
a very tired one . i 've been up all night - and i would .like to rest before the funeral . have your lawyer -
what 's the matter with you ... ? ! what kind of person are you ... ? !
it was quite warranted by the - situation . i realize this is a shock , but really , rowan - you never even knew her . it 's not as if you 've suffered some great -
who the hel1 -
i had you sent away .
-ellie said she died when i was born ! she 's been alive ... ? all this time ... ? why have i been lied to when -
i under5tand . all the same
but my mother ... ellie said she died -
yes . listen carefully , rowan . have your attorney contact me at once . there are matters of immediate -
my ... mother ... ?

rowan and i will be together now . my time has come . your time is gone .
ju1ien was your father your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father . all one in the same ... that is why he fought carlotta for your life .
oh god ...
they want to come back . we have a pact - of mutual desire and consent . the mayfairs ar . a beautiful tapestry . i have weaved you all together - from the start . i brought petyr van abel to suzanne . he had genius in him . scientific , precise . it was a perfect start . and on it has gone - father to mother ... sister to brother ... father to daughter ...
the portraits , lasher . why are the witches always before a door ... ? tell me , lasher . now !
it was an accident . gifford , too .
aaron was in the dream . a dream tilled with spirits . you killed him , did n't you ... ?
tell me what i am , rowan .
no !
that is what you must discover . see what i am , my love . with all your power - see me , and know what i am .
i do n't know what you are ! ! !
there was no thought . there was no act . that is not what i am .
you went into the cells -- - and you changed them . how ... ? !
i do not understand ...
wrong ... ? science is not magic .
what is wrong ... ?
leave me alone !
go on . rowan . go on .
change me , rowan , and we can change everything ...
only you ...
focus all your powers on me , rowan until it is done . only me ...
you must n't hurt him . must n't - must n't hurt..
then help me -- - for his sake ...
i love michael ...
-- - and i have heard you from the beginning ... from it 's very first beat .
but have i ... ? ever ... ? !
i 've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers ... do you know what it 's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach ... ? to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-. ? i did not choose to be such as this ! suzanne brought me here . she called to me !
no , my love . i want nothing more of the dead . i want you to -- - chang me .
and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you ... ? !
i only wanted to see as others do ... feel as others do ... ... but marguerite could not help me . nor julien ...
i know that you 're evil .
i love michael . michael ! !
do not tell me that !
i love him !
but i could understand . i want to understand !
what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand .
you crave what i might show you . what you can learn . what i can give you . so much more than michael can .
it 's too soon to know .
a girl ... ?
from the night on the moor , when i was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a mayfair who has wanted me ! suzann . and deborah . stella - marguerite - antha - diedre - all of them . and you will have a child ...
it 's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants .
if that were true , i would not be here .
go away ! i do n't want you here .
there is no one here but the dead .
i bring her flowers too .
i 'm going to have a baby . michael wants to name it after you - if it 's a girl . diedre mayfair curry . pretty , huh ... ? funny -- - i never really thought i 'd ever -- -
i am only what you are -- - what all of you have been . what do you think of yourself now , my love ... ?
you 're very clever , are n't you ... ?

it you harm michael , i will let my anger loose . and you will feel that . do you understand ... ?
if i could feel like you feel ... but i have only others ' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me . things to be felt , yes -- - but not nine to feel ...
if you knew how i yearn for that ...
to love , you must be able to feel .
it is from love .
made it ... ?
you bastard ...
explain this to me -- - violated ... ?
you violated me ! ! ! on my wedding night !
i 1ove you , rowan . i 've always loved you . i only wanted to be in your thoughts . to bring myself into your thoughts - so i could be as we are now .
the wasps were meant for michael - but there 's only so much you can control , is n't there ? the great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-.. why would you hurt him ... ? ! answer me .
always loved you..
stop !
nooo ... no ! stop !
i am with you , my love . like no other can ever be .
like this ... ?
yes , michael . harder -- . more ...
there are things you will not tell him .
lie ... ?
you do not love michael how can you love - if you lie ... ?
i know . you are my son -
i am your son . i would not wound you . i could not - ever .
'kill you ... ? ' you are my mother . do you think i would hurt you ... ?
i 'll destroy you . i swear it ! if you do n't kill me , i 'll find a -
enough ! he is dead . you are here for me now . michael is gone !
let me go ... michaelllllll ...

michael - i 'm sorry ... just give me -
you could kill me - right now , could n't you ... ? could n't you ... ? ! tell me the truth -- - is it lasher ... ? answer me ! !
you bastard !
how 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist ... ?
stop it !
why bother to ask , ro ... ? why do n't you just make me stay , .. ?
michael - please - just . a little longer . do n't leave .
i 've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside ! but i 'm on the outside now ... you put me there !
i ca n't leave now . do n't ask me to explain ! i just ca n't !
that 's not good enough . why not ... ? !
i ca n't .
it 's not true . you have to believe me .

gotcha .

hi . you - you wan na get some breakfast ... ? maybe see a movie ... ?
hi .
nothing is wrong with me . i know something 's in there - and so do you .
something 's wrong with you .
go ahead .
dovetails . got ta be a hundred years old .
yyou look terrible . you 're exhausted . you practically live at the goddamn clinic . even pregnant women who are n't doctors know that you ca n't -
what were you talking about ... ?
when aid you get home last night ... ?
where are you gitting these ... ? aaron -- - if it 's a boy .
nah - i had a shmuck of an uncle named lucas . grayson .

i 'm serious . whatever it was - it 's still there inside me , is n't it - change and all ... ?
your beneficence .
michael - what made you fall in love with me ... ?
- we made a fire .
remember the first time we made love - and then -- -
talking to me dear ... ?
you did that , did n't you ... ?
that 's not funny .
rowan we 're below sea level . i 've spent time there myself .
that 's cause we 're below sea level .
fall in new orleans ... this whole town is waterlogged ! the matches , the wood , my clothes , my skin .
i love you too .
it 's not some fairytale in an old book . michael - look at me . i did n't choose this , michael . this is who i am . i love you .
no . this is unreal ...
no - i did n't kill him . would you rather i 'd let them kill us - after they 'd raped me ... ?
michael !
did you see the old man on the -- -
nobody makes a car like them nasis ...
mm-hmm ...
gee - look at that . i did n't know alligators came this far up on shore
mm-hmm ...
maybe the shrimp you bad last night .
mm-hmmm ...
you look a little green .
dropped it .
hey - you 're bleeding .
a little wine ... ?
wan na snack ... ?
so how come i love you most when you stick your finger in your chin ... ?
their what ... ?
are n't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
guess so . i keep thinking about the witches - when i was ... down there there was - caring . they saved me , ro . they said 'go back ' ... wel1- i came back - to you - to love you . i like seeing it that way , y'know ... ?
that 's great !
i took off my gloves today - with aaron - - and it was okay .
and i thought i was the mindreader .
you 're just afraid i 'll drop dead before i finish the damn house .
hey - i 'm getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking . one crutch at a time , doctor .
smoking is bad for your heart , michael .
no , i 'm ve-ry good -- - and you aught to know .
you 're a ve-ry bad witch , you know that ... ?
than letts get rnarried , michael . i could put a spell on you - and make you say yes .
either do i. i love you , ro . you know that . you 're a total mystery to me - but i love you .
i do n't think of us that way - ever .
ro , how long have we known each other .
if we married , we 'd shut him out forever .
maybe he 's just - waiting ...
he ca n't hurt us , michael . it 's us - our love . he ca n't find a crack in it . he ca n't find a way in .
i 'm wondering why the hell he has n't shown up .
michael - this is beatrice mayfair . and this is her brother , giff -- -
hello..
everyone - this is michael curry .
it 's the next best thing to being there ' - right ... ?
you sure ... ?
let 's see .
i 'll bet she had a wonderful smile .
they need doctors in new orleans too . michael - think what i could do with the money !
what about your work back home ... ?
i 'm soon to be a very wealthy witch .
it 'd take mounths ... and cost a fortune .
i 've come home , michae1 , for the first time . i want to stay here - with you .
yes . i love you . very much .
do you love me , michael ... ?
i am ! and so are you . you thought you 'd found yourself a nice , sensible doctor . pause ) michael , if you do n't want -
rowan ... think of what 's in that book . think of last night !
stop looking at me like that ! i 'm not some siren chanting to the moon . and my life is not a cosmic whim ! i am in charge of my life - - and i want to stay . everything that was taken from me is here , michael . all these years , she was there without me . helpless . i should have been here .
but it scares the hell out of you , does n't it . michael ... ?
even if it 's all true - that does n't make you a witch ! it 's 1992 , rowan !
he 's in there ! or are you out for a stroll in the garden ... ? ! where are you , goddamnit ... ? !
c'mon . let 's go to the ho -- -
is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see ... ? god , michael -- - what am i ... ?
ro - you ca n't really believe that . nobody can murder someone with their feelings . i mean -- - that 's crazy .
michael - i saw him ! twice ! carlotta said i -- - killed graham - with - with my anger .
it could 've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane . maybe -
- a witch .
she - she said i - i was a -- -
i know . it 's not possible -- - but i know .
you know ... ?
goodbye , michael . i love you .
wait a minute . rowan - what is going on ... ?
go to lax and get on a flight to new orleans . go to the ponchartrain hotel and wait for me . i 'll call you there .
what about you coming down here ... ?
michael - i have to go - to new orleans . i 'll - i 'll call yati when i -
what 's wrong.. ?
listen . last night - oh christ , this'1l take forever to explain . god , michael ...
rowan ... ?
michael ! jesus i 've been trying -
hello ... ?
mad . for each other .
we 're quite a pair , you and i .
you could fly down tomorrow . i could be there the next day i think i can last that long without you .

michael , do you want to wear those for the rest of your life ... ?
god knows , i 'm intriguing .
i called dr. styles at the neurological institute in l.a. , remember ... ? he said he 'd see you . he was intrigned .
michael - this place is increadible . you - you 're brilliant ... the things you created ...
seems more like a year than a month .
you stop it . you 're loving , and gentel.. you 're the most remarkable woman i 've ever met -- - so stop telling me i do n't know what i feel just cause you 're scared . cause it wo n't work .
stop it .
let 's see ... next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we 're doomed to fail - right ... ? you hate kittens and puppies , you 've drivin all your lovers to suicide -- and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
i 'm serious . you do n't -
is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is ... ?
christ , michael - what the hell are we doing ... ? we do n't even know -
you do n't know what you meant - because you do n't know me .
all i meant was -
far from it , michael ... do n't put me up there .
captain 's orders .
doctor 's orders- - - ?
just sit there and soak up the vitamin d .
why do n't you let at do that ... ?
okay . y'all make sure and come back now , reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah .
y-u-h-e-e-y-a-h. yu-hee-yah ... ? no way , busters use it in a sentence .
ms. yin , and mr. yang aha !
you look very deep when you do that . it 's interesting . we 're complete opposites- i 'd never just sit and wait for insparation . i 'd skip my turn and swap some letters .
it 's come to that , huh ... ? three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life ... ?
you touched him -- - and saw him ... ? what was he doinging . kinky ... ?
he fools around with his patients too .
he 's very pleased with your response to the surroundings .
mm-hmm . scared- i feel a little like the moth and the flame .
too much ... too fast ... ?
nope- my father died before i was born . my mother died in childbirth . el1ie was my only blood relation . so she brought me here ... the day after i was born .
really ... ? your family there ... ?
i was born , in new orleans , too-
you still feel that crazy ... ?
oh . the green underwater ghost 's ... the man with the eyes in his hands ...
and whose houses do you design ... ?
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside . the queen 's house- . the gangster 's house- . the clown 's house- like that .
it - it feels like - like i 'm being filled up . crowded out of myself . like i 'm fading away-
it 's unbelievable that you can do that .
you knelt there , helpless- you could n't save him . there was so such anger in you- . death infuriates you ...
my uncle . graham . he and my aunt , ellie raised me . he - he - had a stroke- just before ellie died - of cancer . last year .
what 're you - a mindreader ... ? who was the man on the kitchen floor . ~ . ?
what else did you see- michael ... ?
i 'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you .
you 're very -- - different .
yessssss ...
like this ... ? like this ... ? !
harder !
rowan ...
harder ...
no . i 'm not . doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things .
you 're not gon na give me the textbook analysia , are you doctor ... ? my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
you know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
the one time i want it to work ...
just one . the bar 's closed .
nothing . absolutely nothing-
what do you see ... ?
as far as touching things , yes . but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- it wo n't go away god - if i could just understand it .
do they keep everything 'out ' ... ?
then call it in . mr. curry . whatever 's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative . i 'm in the life business - remember.. ?
my jury 's still out on that ,
i 'm glad you 're around to say it .
i do n't remember you at all- you - you saved my life- bizarre thing to say , is n't it ... ?
'freak at the week . ' that 's what the tv crew . call it- people come right to the house . they have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid- they bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it . so i can teel them where they are..
i 've read the stories - and seen the news coverage .
i guess so . the trick is remembering how to act like one . i 'm glad you called , mr. curry . i wanted to see you . why do n't we go to my office ...
they like you -- -- -- - kids .
just do n't fall off any ladders .
a few hours and i 'll be wasting away in margaritaville . oh , sweet decadance .
yes . partly . it 's - it 's - stu - do you believe in -- -
left behind ... ? this about rowan ... ?
i 'm getting -- - left behind .
just nervous . getting married , you know . got the rings ... ?
you okay ... ?
if you like that type .
wow ...
that 's a wasp . fuckers 'll sting a tree if they 're bored- so - where is she ... ?
'leave bees be - and the bees be nice . ' did n't your father ever teach you that ... ?
the guy i told you about - aaron ... ? he says i can learn to control them . that i could lose the gloves at some point .
well , normie - you wo n't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time . how are the hands ... ?
go away , goddamnit !
you ca n't just -
on which planet ... ?
bullshit ! let me in ! mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont .
go home , stu i 'll call you .
i just - hate it when they 're - finished .
sooner or later you 're gon na run out of things to change . you always do .
comes running out the front door - down the walk to them . michael seems to pull inside himself . cool . aloof .
mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that . i mean - hell , they 're all crazy anyway - right ... ?
is that what you were doing ... ?
is that a crack about our singing ... ?
i thought it was 'whistle while you work .
i like him . he can stay .
hey - i love gloves- i look really great in gloves .
he 's got great hands .
you really love this guy ... ?
i thought you were almost engaged , stu ... ?
sut mckinley . marry me .
rowan mayfair .
i plan on liquidating almost evetything .
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash .
no tax shelters . no funding . i want to fund the clinic - exclusively . the diedre mayfair research clinic . i 'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction .
that 's new territory for us ... but yes , we can look into that . explore shelter possibilities , funding bodies . we could -
i 've decided not to open a practice here i want to set up a research clinic . for infant genetic disorder .
standard for a mayfair marriage . rowan - there is a codicil concerning the mayfair assets . they must be ... aahhh ... held separate from the other party ... michael that is it 's in the will - for centuries . tradition enjoins , rowan . of course , future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
papers ... ?
we 'd better get to work on the papers .
do n't mention it - now can i get back to my accounts , or do you want to fillet me ?
sounds good - thank you
why do n't you take a few weeks off - you 're due some holiday time .
i thought someone was following me - i - er - i just needed my computer and some things ... listen , i 'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that ok ?
well i 'm glad i 'm not them - what are you doing here so late ? come to that , what the hell have you got that for ?
i thought you were someone else
a person could get killed round here just for working late
i 'm sorry - i did n't think
oh my gawd !
then it 's going to be 'i killed for sex ' ... listen darling , why wo n't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units . you have n't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping , there 's not going to be a magazine for you to write for ...
i heard something like that
you know that circulation is down for three months in a row .
that 's not technically accurate - simpsons murders were n't sexually motivated .
as long as you get the hacksaw piece done by friday ... friday ?
i 've got a tenant coming over later - can i take the afternoon off ?
do n't give me shit - what do you want ?
the one on the left - definitely ...
which do you think is her best shot ...
yes - i have had it for years .
this must be one of the old keys -
i 'm terribly sorry - i have a bad memory ...
i was n't a manager here then mrs steckler - do n't you remember ?
oh really - you must remember me from when i was a regular customer .
i should n't say this - but you really remind me of someone i know
no - i 've been abroad for a long time ...
hello mrs steckler - we have n't seen you for a long time
i know what you mean - i 'll meet you at vinnies wine bar at six if you like . and do n't make any plans for this evening ...
no - not all the time - i mean
all the time ?
no -it 's no problem - i do it all the time
yes , i 'm sure you could - but i ca n't risk you loosing your job
i did n't say that - i 'm sure it could be , but our clients must sign in first , checking signatures , and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we 've been very strict since then .
and it ca n't be forged ?
that 's right ...
so there is only one key ...
then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
tell me brian , what would happen if the client lost the key ?
yes it is ...
its cramped in here is n't it brian
but - if you could show me round now - and i 'll meet you later ?
brian ...
that 's very kind of you mr griffiths ... ?
well , if you could come sometime just before we close , then i could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points ...
when could i look round ?
yes - it 's about bank safety deposit boxes - i wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round .
chic magazine ?
you see , i am writing this article for chic magazine
no - i 'll have you after
do n't you want me now leslie
it 's what you would do to me
i loved you ellen - why did you do this ?
you killed my friend !
i do n't want either of us to come to any harm - please ...
wait for what ! ?
nothing leslie - i just think we should wait ...
whats wrong ... what have i done wrong ?
crap ! - i wish i had taken a photo of your face when i gave some to that detective - what 's wrong ellen - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning ?
i have n't been using it recently leslie
why whats wrong with the sugar -
it 's not that - i just do n't want any sugar
there is n't that much - you did n't even taste it - what 's wrong - do n't you like my tea ?
i do n't like sugar
what was i supposed to do ?
why did you let him in ?
he does n't need to ...
first finish your tea ...
no thanks -
ellen , would you like a cup - there 's plenty in the pot
yes - i suppose so ...
leslie ? is that good enough ?
i am sorry ...
i thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face ...
leslie i 'm sorry - i - i did n't know what to think
we 've got nothing to talk about
out - i may be some time
where are you going ?
but for how long - what will set you off again ? you 'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round ...
but ellen , i told you i have stopped ...
you want me to wear white for you ? you must be madder than i thought ...
yes ...
open it ...
what is it ?
i am ashamed of what i have done ellen . when i read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - i have n't dared look into myself for a long time - i have stopped ellen , i ca n't carry on - i wo n't carry on . all i want is to start a new life - i want a second chance ... you are good to me - you do n't condescend , you 're intelligent , and very beautiful ...
what 's wrong ?
nothing could be better ...
what 's wrong ?
demons ... this would n't have been possible without you ... you have given me incentive ellen - i can see clearer now ...
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
i know this sounds insane ellen , but ... telling you all of this , writing the book ... it feels good . do n't get me wrong - i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders ... when i tell you what i have done - i ca n't believe it is me ... yet i know it was . this is like a purging for me ...
what ?
then make it stop ...
i want it to stop - it all to stop ...
it was wrong - all my life i have been cheated - cheated of anything good - i should n't have been born - i was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me ...
what was your relationship with stephanie ?
stephanie loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough . we had a ball for years - we could do anything , anywhere , anyhow ... and we did ... we would play games - she would be the executioner and i would be the convict - she would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me ...
did stephanie kill your mother ?
my sister - my adopted sister -
stephanie ?
no ... i did n't do it ... i wish i had but i did n't . i was beaten to it . stephanie became my mother .
did you ?
you think i killed my mother do n't you ?
tell me about your adopted mother
my mother ... ? i never knew my real mother - i was adopted
wonderful - like a great release - he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him - the world is better without him
and how did it feel to be rid of him
why not ? please - it would help me
why should i ?
tell me how it happened ...
that 's right ... do n't ever think that you and i are the same - we 're not even remotely similar . i did what i had to do for myself , for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy . my husband was sick -
you 've killed but you 're not a killer
i do n't think so ... this is n't a game you know ... there are n't points or leagues . sure i killed my husband - but i am no killer .
you are the first person i have ever told any of this to . we are birds of a feather ellen ... we 're in the same league
i hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - i hated it - i should have known , when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - i just wanted a white wedding i think she thought i was a ticket to the good life . i had a good job , prospects . and she was a slut - i did n't know until too late . one day , i came
what did n't you like about her ?
it seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband .
then why did you marry her -
my wife my wife was the only one who really deserved it . leslie do this . leslie do that . leslie it 's your fault ... she used to tell me what to wear , where to go , what to do - she mothered me ...
tell me about your wife ...
i have something i have to show you ...
how long have you been watching me ?
why should i feel sorry - they 're dead .
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
let me ask you , why do you wear black ellen carter ? what are you running from ?
is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence leslie ?
i do n't know ...
is 'their ' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that i mean , extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ?
i do n't know ...
ok , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ...
i do n't want to talk about it -
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that ? do you dress up leslie ?
you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press , the tv - but i 'm not you know - they are - i do n't watch it for entertainment every night - i do n't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say , how could he cut her up ? she was dead - i ca n't hurt something dead - and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - i could n't eat one of those burgers , you do n't know what has gone in them !
what did you do with her ?
no she did n't ...
did n't debbie deserve anymore ?
because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she does n't deserve any more -
i do n't know
my car i stopped working from my car . she could have stopped me you know - if she really wanted too . that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - if a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged ? why ?
oh anywhere - whenever i needed to - do you know how easy it is to take them ? you just pick up a hiker , or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know , 'look , i have something to show you ' i would say - and that would be it . one girl , i think her name is debbie - she had broken down on the motorway , and i offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - she just got in and i drove away . when i pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze , and said - what do you want ? - i said , you know what i want . - but she did n't . getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first i cut up , put in bags with bricks in , and tossed them off eldridge bridge in broad daylight . the real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain . it made such a mess of
where do you kill them ...
no - the police say i 've killed fourteen - but i 've not - i 've killed many more . it amazes me how they just have n't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just do n't get missed . i agree , some of them are well hidden - i probably could n't even show you where i put them - one girl , number eight i think the press called it - she was n't even mine - i do n't know who did it but i did n't
you do n't know ?
i do n't know
and how many people have you killed ?
oh , about six years since i graduated
and how long have you been a dentist ?
i 'm a dentist
so what do you do ?
yes , one and a half please .
sugar ?
i think i will pass ...
if you want any - there 's some left in the kitchen
do n't worry - is that my hammer well just make sure that it 's put back in the garage ...
yes - i 'm sorry ellen ...
my names is n't angela ...
it says in the contract i can have a lock fitted - is there a problem angela ?
what 's with all the locks - and hammering
i 'm sorry ?
what are you doing ?
yes , two please . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to pry , it 's just that i really loved your book
do you take sugar ?
the touch ?
i lost the touch
tell me - ellen carter forgive me for being so pushy , but are n't you a novelist ? did n't you write that terrific book - 'the color of fear ' ?
sure ...
oh - tell me ellen , i can call you ellen ?
i really do n't know what to say
it does n't mention 'females only '
he saved my life you know - has he told you ...
no he had to - he 's just - he 's out ...
is leslie here ?
i had an accident - i fell down stairs ...
what happened ?
i 'm your landlady
leave ! ? who the hell do you think you are ?
i want you out now
yes i can ...
you do n't own him you know - you ca n't tell me not to see him !
you heard me - keep away from him
what ?
i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie
what 's wrong with you ?
i think he 's fine - i do n't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - i do n't think he would hurt a fly .
yes - but you live here too - if it were your house ?
i do n't know - it 's your house ellen
well , what do you think ?
at 2.00 ...
i 'm sorry , i could n't - when is she due ?
i think you had better leave
i 'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her .
get out ...
as it happens , i was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems ?
at home alone - where were you ?
it did give me a chance to meet you again ellen - it 's all routine you understand ... so where were you ?
you think i 'm the white angel ?
i 'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - it 's best if we let old bones lie . know what i mean ? i 'm working on the white angel case now - and i 've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years ... and that means you ... so where were you last thursday afternoon around five ...
what brings the rats out of the sewers ?
so have you seen hubby recently ellen ?
what 's this all about ?
it 's been what , three years ?
yes - of course .
good - i 've got to dash - say that i said hello to ellen for me would you ...
yes , that would be nice - i 'll call round some time ...
i 'd really like it if you would come round some time - then i could cook you a meal - what do you say ...
that 's good
yes , come on in ...
i 'm good - i was just making a delivery near here , so i thought i would see if you were about ...
i thought it was you - how are you ?
oh ...
her husband left her
and not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ellen ...
you 're a novelist - why did n't you tell me ?
do n't worry about it -
i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to shout ...
no worries
just put it in my room
no - a dentist
surgery ? are you a doctor ?
i 'm really very sorry - i was banking on this coming through , because it 's only five minutes from my surgery ...
yes , sorry - he 's here to make sure that you are alright
angel ...
yes - one please .
sugar ?
who said anything about surgery ... it 'll only take a moment .
i should n't really - i 'm not your surgeon ...
i 'll be sure to ...
oh no sir - just making some enquiries ... just tell her that inspector taylor called on you - she 'll understand
no - she is n't in any trouble is she ?
so she did n't mention anything more about it ?
or was it , she wished he was dead - that 's it - i believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid .
dead ?
inspector dave taylor - scotland yard ... can i have a word ?
yes ... ?
dr steckler ?
except the girl . the only one that really mattered .
you got everything you ever wanted .
next time , make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold .
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty . we wanted to showcase women throughout the world .
holy stinkers , what were you thinking ?
brilliant ! molly , give me all you 've got . for merk .
get them together .
i love those springy head puppies !
and while you 're at it , i 'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads .
no , leave one . somebody 's grandmother might want one .
hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of 'em !
chicks are like buses . if you miss one , do n't sweat it . there 's another coming 'round the corner .
i thought i loved her .
with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
i feel like i 've just been hit by a mack truck .
it better not be my aunt trudy .
you 'll never believe who 's in there .
sorry . ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic .
you 're late , bro !
yeah , he 's probably been serving cocktails , so to speak , at the orgies .
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he 's seen .
give me those !
i 'd call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she was n't your mother mother --
how would you like it if i did that to your mother 's panties ?
take a whiff of heaven .
oh , how inappropriate is that !
... where they get all the really good porno channels on cable .
i feel like i 'm entering a forbidden tomb ...
i 'd feel like staying up all night ! forever ! or at least till i got the lay of the land , so to speak .
it 's a lot to digest . imagine how you 'd feel .
do n't be such a pansy . all of this is yours .
and some really fast cars .
then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .
our plane crashed . in the grand canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to l.a. they needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven .
dead ?
i get it now . you and me . we 're dead .
beauty ? no . we 're talking goddess .
do n't tell me . another vision of incomparable beauty ?
check it out !
what is it now ?
hurry .
i better go , dad .
check this out . hurry !
yeah , whatever .
so far away ? in xenia ?
i 'd kiss your mother with this mouth . i mean , if she was n't , you know ...
you kiss your mother with that mouth ?
not ever . never .
oh . well . maybe not yet .
this is n't some 80 's porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .
i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight ?
be cool . fake it if you have to .
this is like my every wet dream come true . i do n't even care that you 're here , too , bro .
perv .
i ca n't believe that 's your mother . we 're talking babe-a-licious chub fest , right here in the 501 's .
and like every hamburger guy knows , when you get your one big chance at the good life , you abuse every second of it until they figure out you do n't belong there and kick your sorry ass out .
wait a second , i thought we were hamburger guys .
do n't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .
for a guy about to try his first dom perignon , you are extremely uptight .
cut it out , before you break something !
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we 're talking spring break !
maybe he got promoted .
... a bouncer ? are you serious ?
well , dad said ...
who the hell was your father ?
astronomical .
what are the odds of there being another ted nelson on our flight ?
and nobody knows you 're a virgin ! aw , who are we kidding ...
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .
nobody knows about your mental retardation .
seriously , it 's like we 're being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation .
poor freud , turning in his grave .
think about it ... long tunnel , bright lights , it 's full of vaginal symbolism .
any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
do n't do it , ted . do n't do it .
i defy any and all limits .
that 's crazy talk .
i defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .
you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
someday , i 'll find out .
one thing for sure , christy malone ai n't lookin that good naked .
were you always this sick ?
the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april . `` hi , my name 's ginger . i love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . '' here 's a tip : set it on vibrate , honey , and do n't be stingy with the lube . do n't knock it till you tried it .
she smiles at everyone , ted . she 's like a newborn with gas .
see ? did you see that ?
that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you 've been over-tenderizing your meat , again .
i genuinely think she wants me . i feel a vibe .
that 's charlie . my best friend . he 's into beef analogies , partly because he 's a butcher 's son , and partly because , well , he 's just into beef analogies . what can i say ? he 's also a photographer ...
do n't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we 're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .
you and your pep talks .
come on , bro . spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation ...
god , i love being dead .
we do n't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there 's a market for it .
these are real , live women ?
if it is n't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .
let me get this straight ...
every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month . it 's your job , ted , to decide which of them is right .
oh , god . look . look .
never say never .
this is a fun place ... but we do n't usually come here until after the orgies .
naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it 's called `` heaven . ''
he kicked major ass and you know it .
not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism .
jealousy is so unattractive .
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .
you 've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers .
new hushpuppies do n't make a new man .
we reinvented ourselves .
what gives , don corleone ?
then you better get in the water , before you get burned .
god , you are so hot .
maybe on the outside . but inside , deep down , i 've always been dripping with special sauces . are you hungry ?
come on , i was hamburger . you were porterhouse .
i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you .
oh , teddy bear , you 're funny .
you expect me to think at a time like this ? there is n't a drop of blood in my brain .
i mean , what do you think ?
you have changed since second grade .
well ?
things change . now i 'm taking off my clothes ... all by myself .
i miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .
remember dress up day ? you and charlie lifting skirts during recess .
that was code for `` i like you . ''
which you pulled , hard !
i remember the first time you walked into mrs. temple 's class in 2nd grade . blue gingham dress . blond ponytail .
you know ... take the pictures ?
do it ?
i have to admit , i am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .
i do ? i mean , yeah , i do .
i thought i 'd be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed , teddy bear .
i turned eighteen over spring break . i 'm eligible .
christy ? you want to be in `` heaven ? ''
hi , teddy bear .
makes your shoulders look so big and broad .
yeah ? you like ?
great jacket , teddy bear .
the answer is never , ted , never . except maybe in your dreams .
so that 's a maybe ?
you really do n't get it , do you ? i am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring ! it 's , like , a caveman thing !
so you 'll think about it ?
oh , ted , duh . i smile at everyone since i got my braces off .
but that smile .
i do n't like you . we 're just friends .
you like me . i like you . i guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone .
ted , have you lost your mind ?
shut up ! are you serious ? of course i will ... of course .
teddy ? would you please please please take me to the prom ?
if you do n't have ... i mean ...
yeah ?
and i was wondering .
yeah ?
well . the prom 's coming up .
ladies first . i insist .
you go first .
from your lips , to god 's ears .
would n't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?
we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after .
we think you should give up the magazine . sell it . let someone else run it . whatever it takes .
we miss our family .
we miss you . we miss our son .
we 're not ashamed of you , teddy . we do n't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called `` flesh parties '' you attend . but we can get past all that .
do n't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family ?
but that does n't make you the boss of everything , son .
you have to understand . this was a big shock , for all of us . one minute you 're our little boy , of whom we could not be more proud . the next minute you 're the owner of this whole pornographic empire .
we love our lives just the way they are .
we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday . something real and honest .
ted , we put a lot of love in our business .
oh , honey . we ca n't accept this extravagance .
i always wanted craftsman tools . he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors .
sweetheart , what is it ?
of course , dumpling . its very nice of ted but ...
we ca n't accept it . it 's much too expensive . right , dear ?
we own a small family grocery store .
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning .
i will not have my boys arguing .
shut your pie hole , jimmy .
why do n't you just admit what this is really all about ? i 'm not your real kid and you ca n't control me anymore .
watch your tone , mister .
that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine .
you ordered a winnebago ?
i paid off the mortgage ! i ordered that winnebago you always wanted ! now you 're ashamed of me ?
your mom said you 've been ignoring your chores .
it 's okay . you need me ?
sorry i --
consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .
but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true .
we 're grateful , ted . it 's not that . those craftsman tools ... they 're a dream come true .
finally , some gratitude .
well , good . every little bit helps .
dad , let 's just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .
i know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?
just say it , dad .
ted , it 's your dad . i have a question for you . i do n't know how to put it tactfully . you know i 'm lousy with words .
... not the pit .
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach ...
i guess it 's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
whatever helps you cope .
like one of those `` national geographic '' specials with the topless chicks ?
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
be a sport . how bad could spring break in los angeles be ?
yeah .
they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy .
i guess .
they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .
well , why should i ?
son .
they did n't want me when i was born . why should i care ...
of course we are .
you guys are my parents .
i 'm getting so good at this .
sometimes you have to do stuff you do n't want to do . it 's all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .
the lesson being ?
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . grandpa almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you did n't have to slaughter your sow .
you 're way ahead of me again ?
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you ?
grandpa was so strong back then . working from the crack of dawn . so proud of his peaches .
dad , please .
i remember spring break of my senior year . seems like a lifetime ago .
it 's my private business ! mine !
we understand your disappointment , teddy . christy is a pretty , sexy , provocative , voluptuous ... we ... uh ... we understand your disappointment .
i guess ... i do n't know ... i guess we should leave if we 're not wanted .
well ?
hang in there , i 'll think of something .
this is humiliating . we 're being ejected from a prom !
what do you want me to do ?
ted ! do something !
of course we were .
teddy , i thought we were having a moment here .
whatever you want .
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?
hmmm ?
teddy ? i was thinking .
then remember , you are the heir to a billion dollar empire . you have a staff of literally thousands . multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still ca n't even wrap your head around everything that is yours . all yours .
i always knew there was more . i felt it .
or do you have a taste for the good life , ted ? it 's in your blood .
and who is ted nelson ?
what do you mean ? i 'm ted nelson .
who exactly are you ?
hi ho , silver .
do n't worry . he found the chocolate room .
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
hey , ted . wan na go shopping ?
i almost did n't recognize you without ... you know ... that stallion between ... your ... uh ... legs .
that 's me .
the one with the horses .
i know . i 'm ginger . miss april .
i 'm ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .
your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . `` like a woman , purring with ecstasy . ''
some of them have to be automatics .
it 's your car . these are all your cars .
i do n't even know if i should be doing this . it 's a very expensive car .
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again .
got it .
now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear .
want a lesson ?
i do n't have much experience with a ... uh ... stick .
you do know how to drive ?
they 're in the ignition , silly .
i-i do n't have the keys .
everything .
so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything .
before we knew it , we created the most popular men 's magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .
can you believe that was me ?
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .
but we did want you . it 's just that you do n't always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .
if you 're anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we did n't want you when you were born , so who cares if we 're dead ? am i right ?
but do n't worry ... we 'll be in heaven . the real heaven , i mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .
but if you 're watching this , then it means we bit the dust .
oh , sweetheart ! we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you !
but how can you respect yourself if you do n't ?
and the girl i love , she hates `` heaven . '' if i keep it , she 'll never respect me .
i understand .
they 're not my parents , helen . my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much .
your parents would be crushed to think you were n't happy with it .
my legacy .
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded `` heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .
i wondered about them , for so many years . i wondered if i looked like them , acted like them . i wondered why they gave me up .
they kept this scrapbook of your life . it meant the world to them .
you mean they knew who i was ?
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life , ted . they knew your mom and dad loved you very much . they knew they did the right thing . but that does n't mean they did n't watch you and miss you , from afar .
look , the girls of xenia are gorgeous , you 'll see . next month we 'll be back to normal .
it 's a little more serious than that , bill . the stockholders have requested a meeting . they want our guarantee that this will never happen again . some of them are even calling for ted 's resignation .
we 'll send you the release forms , ted . our staffers will help in any way they can .
no problem , consider it done . i had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ?
i 'm helen mcdole . your father 's executive secretary .
you 're on the next plane home .
matter of fact , jay , i 'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown , `` the girls of xenia . '' just to show my appreciation .
i see , so you 'd be open to little ladies from pasadena , who want to show you their knickers ?
matter of fact , jay , my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of `` beauty . ''
what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in `` heaven ? ''
i 'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols .
are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ?
well , jay . they 've been exceptionally supportive .
how are the hometown folks treating you , back in xenia ?
from my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is your oyster . you scored big .
great .
you ever look down on them again and call them `` grocers '' like it 's a dirty word , and you 'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . got it ?
i did n't forget .
but just for the record , my mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas . you seem to have forgotten they opened nelson 's family market so they could build something permanent , a legacy , for us . their kids .
look ted . i 'm cool with everything . you 've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . you 've always had an itch for the good life . i 'm happy for you . this could n't happen to a nicer guy .
that 's a crappy thing to say .
i meant biologically .
he was my grandfather , too .
funny you should say that . my grandfather was a peach farmer .
you 're a peach .
you ca n't come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .
i miss them , too .
aside from the fact that mom 's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that is n't broken , things could n't be better .
are they okay ?
are you kidding ? mom and dad discover i 'm gone and i 'll be doing hard time .
that 's it ? i mean , you do n't want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .
just a formality .
you want it in writing ?
if you could just sign right there .
you can have it , then . i 'm not going back there .
mom and dad said it 's yours . they seem to think you 're coming home .
it 's not up to me .
better view , more spacious , new carpet . it 's a no-brainer .
my room ?
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room .
very funny .
my new bike .
so , what brings you here at his hour ?
they say money ca n't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile .
most places are , jimmy .
impressive . this is bigger than our whole house .
it 's really late ... do your parents know where you are ?
she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .
sheryl petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?
you can call me jimmy again . sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious .
james , what are you doing here ?
why ca n't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil ? i mean , for god 's sake , we own a grocery store !
mom , dad . meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . he 's what you 'd call clinically bummed .
you better .
they 're playing our song . dare i ask for this dance ?
let your fingers do the walking .
yellow pages ?
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i 'm about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia , ohio .
planet ted . five years from now . what 's happening ?
i know where you can find any number of naked girls who 'd love to hop on board .
the thing is , i 'll need a first mate .
very ambitious . i like that .
and i thought maybe i 'd take up boating . i 've always wanted to be a `` coxswain . ''
i decided to let helen run the magazine . i need to go to college , learn a few things , you know .
i 'm not going anywhere , ted . you 're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
julie , wow . i was afraid you left . i was afraid i 'd never see you again .
keeping your word is something i can actually respect , ted .
the thing is , i made a commitment . i said i 'd do it and i have to keep my word .
you think you 're working with chimps here ?
you 're quick . i like that .
which explains the continued success of `` heaven '' for how many decades ?
you 've seen one naked breast , you 've seem them all .
you 're telling me you do n't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .
aw julie , it 's my job . it 's like being a doctor .
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .
i know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
i have to be honest with you , ted . i really despise `` the girls of xenia . ''
but absolutely true .
that 's hard to believe .
julie , i 'll tell you something that is the god 's honest truth . i 've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .
maybe someday .
i want you to trust me .
trust is something you earn , over time . you do n't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .
come on .
not a chance .
do you trust me , julie ?
you lose trust in someone and it 's over , done , gone , forever .
turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? i saw that one coming .
you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
a portuguese boyfriend . sounds very `` cosmo . ''
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .
i see .
sounds , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
tell me more .
i 'm very aural .
what about you ?
that 's refreshingly deviant .
my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs .
wearing them ? or humping them ?
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish . not many people know that .
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .
i 'm trembling with excitement .
look at us . it 's one o'clock in the morning , on a school night . we 're in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart .
amen to that .
at least it 's not another 4-h meeting or a big brother barbecue .
you expected whips , chains , merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?
i do n't know . this place seems pretty tame .
let 's do it .
i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati .
he 's on the move ?
well ? where the hell are you ?
that 's probably my office .
then you wo n't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week ...
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . i 'm honing my craft .
he shut down your paper ! you 're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches !
you forget , i dislike you at least as much as him .
there 's got ta be something . we have to dig deeper .
that 's two words . and i 'm out of the `` exposed '' business , remember ? i need to graduate . besides , merk 's a boy scout .
in a word : merk . exposed .
cut to the chase , william randolph . your audience is way ahead of you .
if we were a team , we could do anything . i mean , anything .
but you never do .
even when you infuriate me , i still want to kiss you .
i know .
you 're amazing .
then you 'll see who 's really holding on to you .
and then what ?
eventually you 'll let go .
i feel like i 'm being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
it 's incredibly simple .
it 's all so complicated .
a father is nothing but sperm , ted . it takes a real man to be a dad .
i mean my father .
your dad taught you everything .
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?
the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted .
now it makes sense , the whole neo bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you 're a poor little rich girl .
i doubt it .
i see .
he phoned it in .
he cared enough to want you to have it .
not `` whatever . '' it 's two different things .
whatever .
he did n't . he had it built .
i ca n't believe your dad built this for you .
to the best hiding place in the world .
where are we going ?
put your eyeballs back in your head , william randolph . i 'm on assignment . a girl has to fit in .
wow ... you clean up nice .
you 've got enough people kissing your ass .
why ca n't you be nice to me ?
second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
charlie 's right . jealousy is so unattractive .
you 're implying she 's , what , a gold digger ?
you 're so twitterpated you do n't even see the miner 's hat and the pickax .
well ? what do you think of her ?
a little respect would be nice , that 's all .
and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like i 'm rebecca of sunnybrook farm .
see ? you 're impertinent , rude , sarcastic .
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted .
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world 's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .
my adoptive grandfather . who knows what my biological grandfather did .
i did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .
funny you should say `` peachy . ''
life must be peachy on planet ted .
write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you 're crazy about me .
is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release ?
do n't write that part .
you never know around here .
she said peanuts , you cretin .
interesting .
i guess .
i see . so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .
i felt limited . i felt confined . i felt like i was suffocating .
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
i do n't get the distinction .
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ?
i have to admit , i always felt ... different .
really ? you wan na write about me ?
`` local boy inherits more money than god . '' call me crazy , but i smell human interest .
me ?
then i 'll write about you .
what do you want from me ? i 'm trying to be fair . but i ca n't keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .
that 's not entirely true .
i 'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .
i 'm trying to help .
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world does n't mean you 're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .
come on , julie . do n't screw up . you have some real talent .
ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you did n't even know it was there .
in the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda '' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
in what sense ?
your article sucked .
what is it , william randolph ? your balls need scratching ?
it 's so nice to have friends like you , christy .
a few billion bucks and suddenly he 's cro-magnon man of the year .
it was for your own good , in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way .
but you triple-dog-dared me .
i tried to warn you , william randolph . she 's got stiletto heels hidden in those keds .
-- do it . i triple-dog-dare you .
i have absolutely no intention --
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .
me-ow .
i did n't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job .
christy 's a very talented journalist . i see a pulitzer in her future .
do n't even tell me you 're hot for miss titty pom poms over there .
look , i loved `` exposed ! '' and i hate it that you got busted . i know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it 's really not that bad .
is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning expos changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .
let me guess : retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof !
that 's just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
so , william randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale .
do n't say `` shit , '' honey . use the strong vocabulary god gave you .
i need your help . i 'm really in deep shit .
oh , teddy . we missed you so much .
everything i am is because of you . can you ever forgive me ?
forget the store . think big .
but who would run the store ?
like take that trip to buckingham palace . go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico . now 's your chance .
like what ?
you 're free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do !
oh . goodness .
do n't you get it ? in one day i earn more interest than the store 's entire annual revenue .
but how would we pay our bills ?
you do n't have to work another day in your lives .
i 'll make you very proud .
you promise you 'll finish school ?
only the best for my mother .
oh , good lord . are those neptunes ?
mom . believe me . i could buy all that and the factories they came from .
everything is lovely , ted , but much too expensive .
just a few tokens of my affection . i 'll be back soon , do n't worry .
what is all this ? when are you coming home ?
well ? surprised ?
it 's okay , mom . trust me .
save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we do n't want you to run up mr. zukerman 's phone bill .
yeah , i 'm doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i do n't even know where to begin .
did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?
i 'm all right , mom . i 'm not in siberia , you know .
charlie , at a will reading ? what did i do to deserve this ?
what about charlie ? you boys could make it a little adventure .
what ? having spring break ruined by will readings ?
that 's part of growing up , honey .
i do n't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town !
no cursing in this house , young man . use the strong vocabulary god gave you .
what is this ? does everybody know everything i 'm about to say or do every freakin ' minute of the day ?
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
you called the cops on us ?
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
what law , merk ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?
mr. nelson , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law .
you kicked us off your turf , merk . do n't rain on our parade .
a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything .
i 'm warning you .
a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to principal dick merkin ?
you 're crossing the line , mr. nelson .
deaf ears , mr. nelson . i answer to a higher power .
come on , it 's our only senior prom .
rules are rules .
honestly , merk . it 's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .
if that were true , this would be one seriously constipated town . most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in `` heaven '' since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress .
we can not afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community !
with all due respect to merk , he does n't have to read my magazine . but he has no right to stop others . ever hear of the first amendment ?
i guess you wo n't be wanting that rolex i sent you , then ?
what kind of sick question is that ? i 'll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .
have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
i never figured you for a pimp .
are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it 's every red-blooded , heterosexual male 's dream .
that 's a good start , yes . a very good start .
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . you do n't need to be pandering flesh . it 's nonsense . it 's beneath you .
yes , sir . i 'll brace myself .
i 'll be blunt . i know you can take it .
thanks , principal merkin .
i like you , ted . you know that . i liked you before you were filthy rich .
aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone . i 'm your uncle for gosh sakes .
that 's right . and guess who 's the new king of the unemployment line .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .
my job . back off , benedict .
what are you doing ?
-- peaches ! canned peaches !
i loved my brother . i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company . a son he never knew . a son that he and his wife gave away at birth . a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own . nevertheless , i was there for the lad . i guided him as best i could . but he 's only seventeen , with a mind of his own and judgment that is , well , frankly , not a chip off the old block . there is only one clear solution ... and i think we all know what that is --
we 've got a huge problem with the magazine , ted-baby . our readers hate it . hate it . we need to talk .
yes ?
you 're a great kid . do n't you forget it .
thanks , uncle billy . thanks for everything .
you 're right . i should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print .
i 'd love to , but i really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and i 've been slacking .
yeah , well , like my grandpa used to say ... you ca n't change your christmas past , but you sure can exchange your christmas presents .
i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up .
i owe it all to you . without your help i 'd be lost .
you 're taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you 're still keeping your small town values . you 're not letting all this `` stuff '' spoil you .
seriously ? i 'm doing all right ?
such enthusiasm . have i told you lately how proud i am of you ?
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything .
i ca n't wait to see the pictures .
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red .
he was in a league of his own .
my father must 've been amazing .
really ? so i 'm doing ok ?
so far , so good . some of them have real angel potential .
i 'm ted nelson . i guess you already know that part . for two years i 've been the editor of the high school paper in xenia , ohio . i 've won some awards , made a difference . i 've always had journalism in my soul . now i know why .
do n't forget to tell them all your qualifications .
that 's perfect .
at our press conference tomorrow , i think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36d 's , with blond hair upstairs and down .
in other words , our scope is too narrow .
the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in africa and asia . imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine .
you think we should be more open minded ?
well ... for one thing ... i think it 's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ''
what kind of ideas ?
it 's not like i did n't have ideas , i had plenty of ideas . but i never even shared them with your father . never had the guts .
my parents always say hard work builds character .
i never finished school myself . never had to . my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife 's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . i never struggled for a second .
you seem like you 're anything but lazy , uncle billy .
i 've been very lazy for a long , long time .
really ? you 'd do that for me ?
you are home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , i 'll be your point person here on the magazine .
it 's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
no one will be laughing at you now , ted . you can take that to the bank .
i would have been laughed right out of xenia .
you were the new and improved you .
i was like a different person tonight .
i told you you could do it .
why , look who 's here .
whoa . but ... that 's the thing ... i 've never even actually ...
the supreme sovereign of sexuality .
me ? the king of coitus ?
you 're the sultan of semen . the monarch of masturbation . the merchant prince of lust . you . ted . are the king of coitus .
you are a multi-media magnate . the tycoon of tits . the baron of bottoms .
i do ?
huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
all those people out there . it 's a lot of pressure .
you ? nervous ? why on earth should you be nervous ?
truth is , i 'm a little nervous .
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the nelson 's . right , right . how midwest . i like that .
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody 's dying to meet you .
yeah . everything 's cool .
there you are , ted-baby . everything all right ?
tipping ?
we do n't allow tipn , ted .
i ... uh ... i think she 's doing fine on her own .
maybe she needs help , ted . you should be a gentleman .
indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . as it were .
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?
seldom ? no kidding ?
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy . which is seldom .
you 're sure ?
as much as possible .
a lot ? i mean , a whole lot ?
of course i like girls .
you do like girls , do n't you ?
i have only one concern ...
uh , sure . uncle billy .
smashing ! welcome to the family , ted . you are going to breathe some new life into this place . you are going to set the world on fire ! you are going to ... call me uncle billy ? please ?
your fathered owned the entire `` heaven '' empire . you own it now . any questions ?
i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand .
are you familiar with `` heaven ? ''
it 's spring break . i do n't want to go to a will reading .
how quaint .
well kid , i 'm speaking of ... your biological parents .
you 've got the wrong guy . the closest my parents have been to the amazon is the brazilian pavilion at epcot .
i 'm terrible at this . i blurt . i 'm a blurter . your parents ... they ... well ... they exist no further . skinny-dipping . the amazon . piranhas . it was n't pretty .
my parents ? what do you mean ?
it 's about your parents .
oh no . no way . i 've had all the bad news i can take for one day .
i 'm just a messenger .
people pay good money for that ?
bad news .
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it would n't really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door ... what are you selling ?
in a hurry , are we ?
i ... you know ... i ...
how you doing , artie ?
the van ryan family created blue bay . they built the school ... sandra van ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass , they say , left , right , or in the middle . you 're gon na need some help on this one , sam . you 're gon na need a lawyer , and he 'd better be a good one .
that 's great . i 'll just tell my creditors i 'm not a rapist . no problem ... shit . i ca n't believe the board 's going to act without even hearing my side of it .
all i can tell you sam , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay ...
this is insane .
sam ... i ... sandra van ryan 's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she 's pushing for suspension ...
... is accusing me of rape . jimmy told me . apparently i 'm the last to know ...
kelly van ryan ...
talk to me artie .
i have the feeling , they got it down already . they 're a step ahead of us , artie .
so , did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life ?
i 'd like that .
i love antigua . maybe i 'll come visit you .
i was thinking , antigua , maybe .
and where might that be ?
hey , i 've got it , i may as well spend it , right ? i 've always wanted to live where i could dive for my dinner .
thanks .
you look pretty .
senior class fund-raising gig . i told 'em they could hose down the jeep . hey , come on . it 's for a good cause .
she 's going to wash your jeep ?
kelly .
is that sandra van ryan 's kid ?
eat a power bar .
not that i 'm going to be much good after last night ...
second you get something on those teeth , i want it
could be hers . types match . could be a lot of other people 's too ...
what about the blood ?
ray . stop calling . i told you the dental records will take time ...
the teeth doin ' any talkin ' ?
merritt , forensics .
we can get blood type right away . dental records will take longer . you want dna , that can take weeks .
how soon can we get something ?
i 'm fine . nice tv .
you okay ?
and the other girl , kelly . suzie 's niece .
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half- sisters .
raised her like she was , but no , walter 's my only child . he was a good boy , till the army took him .
suzie . then you 're not her grandmother ...
she had it , before she drank herself to death . was n't exactly a love child ...
and the child ...
was n't enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here . he got to be old , he and his rich cronies would come down here , hunt and whore , act like assholes . one trip he showed up with this young girl he 'd picked up somewhere , gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp . that came with her .
was there ever any kind of investigation ...
no . not after that night . i do n't know what happened . maybe he caught her with some john ... all i know is , the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy ... indian kid named davy . used to live down the road there in a wrecked car . him and suzie were at the glades that night . it was right after that , ray got suzie busted and sent her away . that 's what there is to say about ray duquette .
she still work there ?
got sort of hung up on her , from what hear .
he used to come around here . he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades .
actually , i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette .
about suzie ?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
you come all the way out here to watch walter ?
then i guess walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye . he do n't use it for no good deeds anyway .
what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ?
gator ca n't see what 's in front of it for shit . they see out the sides . that one do n't even know walter 's arm 's in his mouth .
i know one thing he said . it was when ... when he took himself out and was standing up . he said , `` do n't worry , i did n't come . '' i ca n't forget that . he said , `` no little girl can ever make me come . ''
try , kelly .
not at first . he was still inside but he was n't moving or anything ... he said we had this secret . and that now he 'd be able to help me ... because we were close ... something like that . i do n't know . it 's hard to remember , exactly .
you mean he withdrew ...
he kept saying , `` let it happen , let it happen . '' then he just stopped .
then what ?
i ... he had my wrists pinned behind me . i remember my hands were cold . '
did you try to fight him ?
he was large ?
no . i 've done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...
that 's okay , kelly . you 're doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
yes . i said stop . i screamed . i mean that 's how it sounded in my head . he hurt me ...
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?
he said something like , `` do you want it dirty7 '' or something . i tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .
i understand .
they were in me . both places ... you know .
take your time .
the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ...
i know you do .
i just want to get it over with . my mom 's making me do this . i just want to forget it .
how are you , kelly ? would you like to take a break for a minute ?
suzie ?
kelly 's file . read it . you 're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who 's made threats on her mother 's life and a female lover she 'd never identify .
you could tell me where you were last night .
i do n't know what to say ...
ray thinks she was murdered .
maybe she used another name .
she did n't cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .
how long ?
suzie toller is missing .
is n't that against the law , peeking into windows ?
there 's a strip mall not half a mile from my house . there 's phones there . i cruised the place , but i did n't see her . i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and did n't want to be found . i do n't know ... maybe i should have called . but it 's not like kelly ca n't take care of herself . i figured we 'd just take it up on monday , in the office .
were n't you a little worried about her ... ?
no .
did you call anyone ? did you call her house to see if she got home ? did you call the masons ?
again . i think we covered this . i told her i was going to call a cab .
and when you turned her toward the door , where did you expect her to go , without a car ?
i 'd like that .
if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there 's quite a collection down in the pagoda . i 'll see you get a proper tour .
it 's homicide 's job now , ray , let 'em do it . i 'll tell you something else , there 's more to this story than you know , ray ... if suzie is dead , i think hunter may be on the right track ...
the blood type on the rocks matches suzie 's .
he 's leaving the country . and i do n't give a shit .
where 's lombardo ?
i 'm tired , ray . i 'm going home .
if i 'm wrong about those teeth -- it 's a promise .
and if the teeth are n't suzie 's ? you 'll give this up ?
stick with me on this gloria . i need you ...
what if i 'm right , gloria ? what if i 'm right and hunter 's wrong ? what do you do if you see a bad thing coming ?
ray , you heard him ...
will you do me one favor ?
we do n't know that , ray ...
poor dumb suzie , she never had a chance .
you do n't think sam could 've put it there ?
her grandmother said she 'd been threatening to run away . and i found the car at the miami bus terminal .
the swamp , most likely ... lombardo 's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he 's made a mistake .
where 's the body ?
those are suzie toller 's teeth .
two kids could 've gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .
just check out the car .
if you want company ...
you have someplace to be ?
i 'm gon na take you back to the office . will you put out a call on suzie 's car for me ?
ray . we do n't know anything yet . she could be anywhere ...
it 's starting , gloria . this is how it begins ...
i mean something bad , gloria , something bad you saw coning , and you did n't do anything , and then it happened . i did that once . i do n't want to do it again .
we all have ...
were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you did n't do what you could to stop it ?
you could say that .
guess i kind of lost it there .
what ? you would n't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter ? cone on . she bought the same story we did ...
which she might have saved , if she had n't set out to destroy the man 's life .
i net a guy in a bar .
where 'd you come up with this stuff , anyway ?
you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like lombardo went belly-up in the swamp .
eliminate the competition .
i flat do n't like the guy , glory . he 's dirty . and i 'll tell you something else . you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan , on a little item known as the salt creek land deal . it was after the war . van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where van ryan wanted it .
this one 's got you working overtime , has n't it ?
her father did n't leave her squat . the kid 's got money in trust from her grandfather , but she ca n't touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck .
so what about the girls ? suzie 's poor , but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ? surely her father ...
the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man 's surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him ... it 's just a reminder of what should have been his .
why ? you ask me , lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he 's gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you 're describing ...
they chumped us , gloria , right from the start .
unless you 're setting up sandra van ryan for the big payday .
unless what ?
i thought of that . then i said , come on , you 're lombardo . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you do n't want to sit in jail for three months . unless ...
maybe lombardo 's attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . lombardo had an affair with sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place .
lombardo 's settlement ?
you saw the news today ?
it 's a shithole . but she was dirty , what was i gon na do ?
that 's what they called it when i was in juvenile . it 's a pretty dismal place .
you mean camp sixty-nine .
this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . i busted her once for possession . she wound up doing about six months at camp nine .
the skinny brunette .
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay ?
yeah , well , van ryan got his . i do n't imagine he gives a shit now .
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark . you know what you get ? more bark . and more bark . there 's no core . tree 's not good tar anything but sucking up water . and now they ca n't get rid of them . they 've tried poisons . nothing works . they do n't die .
all i 'm saying is , we let sandra van ryan push us too hard , we 're going to wind up looking stupid .
you 're telling me you believe the guy ?
we failed to mention the mower guy 's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house , so he ca n't say how long she was in there . same with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that 's it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his .
still does n't explain why he could n't catch up with her . i mean how long does it take to put on a shirt ?
same as him . they saw her come . they saw her go . they saw him follow .
hunter 's making it our job because sandra van ryan 's got a bug up his ass . you know that as well as i do . we 're gon na trash this guy 's life and i keep asking myself if it 's really necessary .
it 's our job , gloria .
all i 'm saying is , i think we should go slow here .
that would make it about the time of her old man 's suicide . you do n't think that could explain some erratic behavior ?
back to the land of grownups .
i 've got that two o'clock in town .
he said , `` no little bitch can ever make me come . ''
what was that ?
he did say something .
no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that 's all . let me go .
at that point were you able to fight him off ?
i guess .
did he come in with you ?
yes .
so you were alone .
no .
and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?
yeah .
he dropped jimmy off first ?
about a year ago .
we need to tape the interview , suzie . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that mr. lombardo gave you the ride ?
you did n't tell me you were gon na put me on the fucking news .
why is that ?
yeah , maybe , a little .
that bothers you ?
i do n't care . you heard that girl 's statement . i think he 's dirty . get me a case .
you know what that will mean for lombardo .
i want a full-scale investigation .
i worked juvenile in dade county for three years . we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks ... maybe a year ago ... the family kept it out of the papers .
where 's this coming from ?
that does n't make him a child rapist . there 's something else . this girl 's had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom 's cars . ran away ...
i think she 's acting . i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . i think maybe she 's upset that he did n't ...
why ?
suzie toller 's . and that 's the only thing saving your sorry ass .
the teeth , were they ...
she looked shaky , but lucid . i thought , i would just go with her , stand at the door ... i think i looked away . a split second . then , bingo . just like that . she puts a knee into my groin . there was this coffee table between us and the wall . she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case . thing had a glass door . i could hear it breaking . i did n't go down , but she slowed me up , just enough . before i could get to her , she 'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun . i yelled at her to put it down . she got off a shot . i took it in the shoulder . i ... i had no choice . i returned fire . two rounds , i think . in the chest .
you did n't cuff her ?
i told her i was coming with her . she nodded , like she understood . we stood up together .
bit , scratched . but i had her pinned . she calmed down . i was going to cuff her ... she said she thought she was going to be sick . she asked to use the bathroom .
she bit you ?
i told kelly van ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder . i did her rights .
just tell us what happened .
i fucked up . i lost control of the situation , the one thing they train you for ... god , what did i do ?
get off this ray , now . if there is any evidence here , it 's for homicide . you get an id , you call me .
kelly 's next , gloria .
you think this is just about money , about us looking foolish ? question him . you 're gon na find a stone cold manipulative psychopath . and those girls are going to wind up dead ...
oh , ray ... no ...
i do n't believe i 'm hearing this . a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse . they were acting . they were all acting , from the beginning . and we bought it , hook , line and sinker ... and now they 're home free with six million of sandra van ryan 's money .
ray . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the van ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick ...
you heard kelly say `` sam . '' that was lombardo on the phone . and you saw the girls ...
are you crazy , ray ?
and what do they say ?
we 've got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .
what about witnesses ?
not that stuff about her running away , him trying to find her . that 's bullshit .
the line i get on this guy , is that he 's done half the women in blue bay .
or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for ...
your honor ... please ...
he was my friend at first . then i got busted ... he did n't even stick up for me . i had to go away to that hellhole . it 's like , you 're his favorite , then who cares ? you wan na know something ? when kelly said we should do this , i thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , duquette . now they 're gon na get screwed .
i 'm sorry ?
this was n't my idea .
ms. toller . i 'm asking you now , under oath , did samuel lonbardo rape you ?
i said he did .
ms. toller ?
because ... it was the biggest i 've ever seen . and i 've seen a lot on their way through jack 's fish camp .
i 'm sorry ... you said it hurt ? why ?
he pushed into me ... i could n't stop him ... it hurt .
okay ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can i go home ?
suzie ! did this man rape you ?
shit , what difference does it make ... nobody 's gon na believe me anyway ...
what did you do then ?
i wan na go home now .
and then what ... he touched you ? did you maybe flirt a little ...
yeah ... okay ... he did
you guess ? did he or did n't he ?
yeah . but i got my bike .
a ride . you want one ?
what ?
what about you , jimbo , you need a ride ?
hey , you 're working for it . least you 're supposed to be .
you know , i want to thank you for getting me into this class ... no way was my old man going to spring for the fees ...
hey , man , at least in study hail i could meditate .
thank you , jimmy .
no !
come on . beats study hall , does n't it ?
yeah , but ...
way i hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys ...
no . but i mean ... just the idea that mr. lombardo would ...
i say something funny ?
lombardo ever come out here ?
yeah , sometimes . lots of the kids hang out here . you really think something bad happened to suzie ?
you and suzie used to come out here together ?
it 's those rocks , up there .
shit .
i wan na live at the beach someday .
i think we just need to get wasted .
i thought we were goin ' to a movie .
nothing .
what are you looking at ?
what brain ?
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ?
are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp ...
you are .
oh , for christ 's sake .
you 're gon na fuck me over , are n't you ?
you can trust me .
i 'm scared , that 's what . i 'm scared there 's no one to trust .
i ca n't believe you called sam . what 's the matter with you ?
man , i wan na smoke a joint .
yeah , i 've got family and they 've got clout and now you have me . right ? and sam . believe me , suzie , this dickhead 's not going to send you anywhere . he 's gon na try and rattle your cage , and that 's it . stay strong and he ca n't do shit .
yeah , but he ca n't push you around like he can me . you 've got family and they 've got clout . with we it 's different ... with me ...
will you calm down . duquette 's gon na come to you just like he did to me . you 're gon na have to be ready for him .
i 'm not on your property !
get off my property .
police -- god -- get a life .
am i right , did sam sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking suzie ? that 's murder , kelly .
i 've been a cop for a while , kelly . it 's hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . and then there 's the love angle . i mean do you and sam really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ?
you 're out of your mind .
the thing about it is , threesomes so rarely work out .
you all gon na go down to the caribbean together ?
excuse me ?
about what ? how to improve your breast stroke ?
curiosity , i guess .
is there some reason why you 're here ?
a friend of mine bought a boat .
where , the mall ?
do n't bother . i 'm taking a trip .
i 'm here to congratulate my friends and their children . i 'm leaving again tonight .
you did n't have to fly back -- from -- wherever , for me ...
yes . god , mom ...
he ... sam lombardo ?
i was raped . by sam lombardo .
what ?
he did n't have to kill himself , kelly . he could have gone out and gotten a job . christ , he could 've found another rich woman ... he never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married .
no you do n't .
jesus . well , i do too , sometimes ...
i miss dad .
kelly . what is it ?
no thanks to you .
i would hardly say you look like trash .
my friends buy me clothes , so i do n't look like trash .
you notice my new jumper ?
okay , what 's the matter ?
whichever one i want .
which one of your `` bodyguards '' is that ?
sam ! hi !
hi , mon .
is that sam lombardo ?
um-huh . and guess what else ? i have toys .
you think that 's wise ?
i 'm running away .
no little girl can ever make me come .
i love you . now give me the line .
say you love me .
that 's not your line .
that never seemed to worry you at the glades .
okay . i love you too .
so if they 're tapping your phone , we 're dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you 'll never see duquette . okay ? i love you .
but what if they find out ... god , they 'd put you in the gas chamber ...
kelly ... relax . take one of your mom 's valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it 's over . we 're rich .
i do n't know . i want to see you ...
and you believe her ?
i do n't know ... i think it was something else ... suzie says the bust was bullshit ...
yeah , he got her busted for possession ...
i ca n't help it . he gives me the creeps ... i mean why was suzie so scared of him ? she 's not that way . i think he did something ...
duquette . forget him ...
i 'm really serious . that cop , he keeps watching me .
god , i 've been calling you .
hello .
hello ?
there was no way . that cop would 've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...
i 'm sorry , kelly . i 'm sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it ...
okay . i want you to hear this too . we 've got to be cool . all of us . people think i 'm rich , for christ 's sake . i 'm doing what rich guys do . i 'm spending my money . it 's more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing . now do n't let this cop fuck with your minds .
i 'm here .
then do it . i need you on this kelly . do it tonight . we 'll figure something out ... okay ?
you know what it takes .
no ! christ . listen , kelly , i 'm counting on you . you calm her down . i mean do whatever you have to , whatever it takes ...
why ca n't you come ...
shit . i was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?
yes .
kelly . is suzie there ?
stick ?
we have to stick with the plan .
do it to ourselves ?
the only way we 're gon na blow this now , is if we do it ourselves ...
hey , come on ... we 've got to have at least one victory party .
from now on , if we 're seen together , it 's got to be accidental . i thought that was understood ...
of course i 'm crazy . ask my mom .
god , you scared the shit out of me . you must be crazy coming here .
about six and a half million dollars .
how much ?
so you got my mom 's money .
jesus christ , what are you doing ?
look , kelly ... i 'm sorry ... i know what you 've been through ... i should 've seen something like this coning .
drop dead ... you know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she 's trying to break my trust . how do you like that ? i ca n't touch it until she 's dead and she wo n't give me a dime and now she 's trying to break it to pay you ...
kelly ...
mr. lombardo . we 're running kind of late . how about if nicole goes on to the mansons ? you could give me a ride when you find the ticket .
all right . i 'll have to look for it .
rules are rules , mr. lombardo .
jeez , that thing ... ca n't you ...
are n't you forgetting something ? your coupon . we got ta have it .
so , where you off to now ?
in back of the garage .
where 's the hose ? we can set up .
no i did n't . check out the jeep . it 's nice and dirty for you . but you might want to wait a minute . the mercedes is leaving .
look , he forgot . i knew it .
i wo n't .
do n't forget the car wash .
deal . you know , i just looked out front . my ride was n't there . you suppose you could give me one ?
okay , try me on sunday . i 'm going out to the everglades on saturday . you guys can wash the mud off .
just like that ? these people ruined your life , bro .
just like that ?
you 'll get over it . we 've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against sandra van ryan .
i was just thinking about where i 'm gon na stay . i lost the house . it 's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare .
come on , let loose !
fair enough . let 's go make a statement .
i just want my life back ...
good . so what we 're going to do is march right to hunter 's doorstep . we 're going to insist they take a statement . we 're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they 're walking a fine line here . defamation of character , malicious prosecution ...
there 's nothing for them to get .
sound nice ? it 's a fucking drug rehab farm . it 's where kelly van ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp . meanwhile , you get educator of the year i mean there 's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury . shit , they have n't even taken your statement yet . reason ? they 're still shoveling dirt and my guess is , they 're coming up empty . now tell me i 'm right .
nellie gail ranch ...
for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you ... it does n't add up . sandra van ryan 's got 'em running scared . and i 'll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
you 're not in bad shape , really . i know you think you are , but you 're not . let me tell you why . sandra van ryan .
not in here . chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes .
ca n't you take that stupid thing off ?
i know how deep her pockets are , ken . i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan . guess who 's on the board of directors at the bank ?
lady has some deep pockets . that 's all i 'm saying .
forget it .
you can tie whoever did it to sandra van ryan ...
good thinking .
ken . i 'm in some trouble . i need an attorney and you 're the only one i know . so i figured i 'd start here .
but check this ...
suzie toller is dead . you do n't want kelly to be next , then take my advice . stay out of my way .
you ca n't ...
i 'm placing your daughter under arrest .
where she lives . in the guest house . now will you tell me what this is about ?
where is she ?
detective duquette , ms. van ryan . let me in . now .
who is it ?
that 's right .
you 're saying that kelly was raped by sam lombardo .
hey , ray . guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam 's ?
sam , for godsake .
shoulda , coulda , woulda ... get him in the water .
you ... i should 've killed you myself . should never have left it up to him ...
that 's right . that was his name .
davy .
shut up .
do n't you see what this means ? you really think sam and kelly are gon na give you a third of the money ? you , the pill-head with the rap sheet ?
get away from me .
suzie , suzie ... this is me , ray , you 're talking to . we both know you do n't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit ...
i do n't mean who you 're thinking . i have other friends ...
is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?
i do n't have to listen to this . and you ca n't shove me around . i have friends now ...
you , kelly , sam .
is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ?
every triangle i 've ever seen never lasts . somebody 's got to go .
about what ?
well , you 're half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
that 's cop bullshit .
yeah , they 're bad for your health . i 'm tryin ' to look out for you ...
you got something against cigarettes ?
you ought to watch it with that shit , suzie . you get busted again , you go back in a two-tine loser .
then he 'll be back at blue balls ?
it does n't look like it .
will they ?
no .
so suzie , you called us , remember ?
it 's celine . he 's okay . he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are .
i did . at blue balls .
meet my partner , gloria perez .
come off it , man ... it was an accident .
that how you planned it ? you take cut suzie , get me to hang it on kelly , then dump me in the ocean ...
jesus , man ... you okay ?
yeah , or get me drowned .
come on , man . i 'll make a sailor out of you yet .
i thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why did n't you buy a nice big power boat ?
yes , we call it a winch . and these are shrouds , and these are stays .
you mean this thing ?
kelly was supposed to be framed , not killed . what i 'm telling you is , i do n't like surprises .
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle ? jesus , man . it could n't have worked out better . they 're convinced kelly whacked suzie . i ca n't talk 'em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better .
well , shit , you 're the cop , they do n't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you were n't supposed to kill her for christ 's sake .
hey , what did you want me to do , die ?
the bitch shot me , is what happened .
yeah , well , you fixed that . what the hell happened , anyway ?
sit down , lombardo .
fuck you . this is bullshit . i 'm outta here .
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet t-shirt with no bra ...
it is and i do n't . ordinarily ... but , i mean ... there 's this kid standing in front of you crying ...
but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . is n't that against the rules ?
that 's right .
but she ran away .
yes . mainly to turn her toward the door . i told her we would talk on monday , in the office .
and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .
i could , but it 's confidential . look , the point is , we did n't talk . i told her this was not an appropriate time or place .
but you ca n't tell us what she wanted to talk about .
yes .
and she wanted to talk .
yes .
in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt .
like i said , i had n't really expected to use it . anyway , i 'm going through a drawer . i hear a car . i look out the window . i see nicole driving away . i leave my room , and there 's kelly .
the one you bought at school .
i had to go look for this coupon .
story 's the same , detective ...
why do n't you tell us one more time , how kelly came to be with you , alone in your house .
i think there 's some things you do , you do n't want to see yourself doing them .
walter . he 's been aimin ' that brownie through knotholes for years . i saw these , i knew he 'd finally struck gold . i ca n't decide which came out better , that little straw kelly 's got up her nose , or that vibrator you 've got up her ass . what do you think , mr. lombardo ?
how ...
well , i 'd need the famous lombardo charm , not that you 'd have to do anything you have n't done already .
we ?
i 've seen you out there in your old air boat , thinking about what might have been , old man van ryan had n't fucked you out of it . what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back ?
trust me , the guy 's dirty . he 'll like it . especially the part about offing me . now get out of here . go make yourself a new friend .
yeah , real funny . you 're wrong about this , i could get busted on the spot .
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .
fuck the winch . i wan na drive .
what 's wrong ?
that was the same thing ray said .
what ?
but then it is better this way , do n't you think ? no loose ends .
but then you knew what he was like all along ... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on ...
the guy was history when he killed kelly . you knew that .
that was about as grim as it gets .
no , no . look , i probably should have told you a little more , about the part i intended to play . we 'll go through it all again tonight .
are you mad at me ?
i was worried about you , suzie . i decided we should all get together , one more time , before we split up .
good . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us .
yeah , right .
shut up . do n't fall apart . the only people who can blow this is us . remember ?
but i..
put kelly on too .
sam ...
jesus . two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change .
how much is about six and a half million divided by three ?
goodbye , sandra .
grab a clue , sam . you 're a hired hand around here . enjoy it while it lasts .
so maybe i 'm a one-woman man .
look . i know you 're seeing barbara baxter . so what ?
to tell you the truth , i have n't seen her since friday .
did n't you see her this morning ?
shit . here we go again .
no .
listen , kelly skipped school . have you talked to her ?
sandy ... what 's up ?
swamp 's where it 's at , sandy . gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of . you ought to try it some time .
what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ...
sorry , sandy . i 've got plans .
i 'll bet . look , sam . why do n't you come by this weekend . we 'll take the boat out ...
i ca n't , sandy . i 've got to run .
ca n't . got a passenger .
why do n't you come in , have a drink ?
hi , sandy .
what ? you 're going to drive off without even saying hi ?
i 'm sure we will .
well , we 'll stay in touch ... you know .
well , sure . did n't you get your orders ?
what is this ? a whole new train ?
artemus ! look at that . brand spanking new . she 's a beauty , huh ? let 's get rolling .
in the next two minutes ?
all right , all right ... it 'll be okay . i mean , eventually it 'll just run out of steam .
he was going to shoot me ! do you mind ? !
the machine was stopped ! it seemed like a perfect time to disable it ! why 'd you have to throw it into full throttle ? !
oh , i see , an easy plan !
pull the balloon right in front of him ! we 'll board the damn thing !
where have you been ?
my god ! he 's so excessive !
that 's ... that 's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts !
god in heaven , what is that ? !
thank you .
my hat is off to you , sir .
of course not .
are those just button buttons or ... ?
well , hell , maybe we do have a chance .
it was in your book .
oh , well , then let 's kick some ass !
there 's only seventy-eight .
i 'd love to stop him , but have you noticed the hundred armed men ?
we 've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it 'll be a slaughter .
i do n't have to tell you what that would do to our careers !
i know ! i know !
what ? president grant is ... !
artemus , you ready for this ? his next target is albuquerque .
my pleasure .
oh , thank you .
excellent detective work , sir . you should have the honor of going first .
not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ...
what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coot 's mining claim ?
oh , no , we split him fifty-fifty .
when we find him , he is mine .
you said it popped out too easily . nothing 's ever good enough for you , is it ?
so the idea is if a guy punches me , he really hurts his hand ?
i adjusted it .
not again .
my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . i spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to regale you with my lear .
and people are actually fooled by that ?
this ? i 'm testing a new spirit gum , to see how it holds .
what is that ?
we oughta get a couple of those rockets . voom ! we 're there before we left !
relax . we 're almost there .
damn , i wish this thing would go faster .
that rules out willard , vermont ; willard , minnesota ... willard , new mexico ?
got to be somewhere that 's hot . he said it was `` damnably hot . ''
it 's a town !
it 's not a guy ...
willard ...
yes . and a much nicer one than ours .
sounds like a train . looks like a train .
what 's this ?
you 'd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen .
no record of him .
he 's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard .
it is ?
it 's better than nothing .
oh , damn ! that 's it .
shhh ! come on . tell us something !
this is good .
a cylinder recorder . my own design .
sure . it 's a wind-up ... thing .
know what this is ?
you go ahead . i 'll stick with loveless .
come on , let 's at least see if we can find dr. pemberton .
thank you .
sure . we have no idea what 's going on .
can you fill me in here ?
you really enjoy yourself , do n't you ?
they 're so precious when they 're asleep .
i find most criminals slip up somewhere ...
strange ... you 'd think he 'd have this place better guarded .
i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun .
you might have mentioned you had that .
i was six . and ever since , my policy is : act first and worry later .
uh ... how long ago was this ?
those kids , they took my wagon . never got it back .
so ... what happened ?
nothing much to it really . when i was younger i got into a pretty bad run-in with the wyler boys . i saw them coming . but i did n't act fast enough . second-guessed myself . and it cost me ... cost me dearly .
well ... that , too .
`` spontaneous . '' i like that . most people say something like `` hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch . ''
so ... spontaneous . all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot .
what way is that ?
if you do n't mind my asking , were you always the way you are ?
which is why we 're heading to houston , texas . home of the loveless steam engine works .
no , i 'm not all right . they got away . and we ca n't even follow them . they can get off the tracks anywhere they want .
jim , are you all right ?
that 's right ... that 's good .
at least the thing 's not that fast . we just follow it . whenever it stops , we 're there , waiting .
damn it , this is ridiculous .
hey , i tried the board .
at least i tried something .
it 's a repeating steam cannon !
never seen a gun fire so fast !
i 'm going to hit you .
could i just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention .
and if they 've got dr. loveless building weapons like those flying bombs ... they just might do it .
garrison ... ? then the president was right . except it 's not a foreign power , it 's a bunch of die- hard rebels trying to make the south rise again .
that ? oh , it 's a kind of chinese fighting ... i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco . her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me i 've got a book on it , if you 're interested .
all that jumping and kicking .
all what ?
what was all that back there ?
good , i was n't sure you were up to it .
you 're either having a seizure or you just said `` hello . ''
now , what was that ?
come on , jim . i 'm serious . dot ... dash . it 'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it .
you feeling all right ?
yes . now , observe ... .
almost ?
you know your morse code almost as well as i .
then we 've got our proof . excellent . and where do we find this fortunate scientist ?
all right . how about this ? we put a watch on this pemberton , somebody tries to grab him ...
whoa , jim . maybe . but we ca n't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe .
doctor v. l. pemberton . i knew it . he 's a scientist all right . inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine . i 'm telling you , artemus , loveless is our man .
do your own mingling . i 'm not hanging around with some dandy named chauncey .
quite . come , let 's mingle .
that 's a lot of butler .
jim , people talk to foreigners , speak more openly , especially to those as famous as i , chauncey mcneil armstrong , english lyric poet .
call me that again , and you 're going to find a boot where it does n't belong .
come llewellyn , do n't tarry .
my disguise . and here ...
prepare what ?
doyle , once around the park . i need a moment to prepare .
absolutely . have to look for clues ... even if it means dancing with beautiful women .
limestone quarry , southern mansion . easy to get them mixed up ... i say we invite ourselves to the party .
limestone quarry ?
what about the explosive ?
yes . starting with a screw . now , it 's not fair of me to expect someone who 's spent his life wrangling with western desperadoes to fully appreciate what i 'm doing here , but ...
starting with a screw ?
potentially . this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues . the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology . piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain .
is this leading somewhere ?
yes , aha . a brass screw .
aha ?
aha !
i 'll work on it .
that should put us ahead of the criminals .
well ... it 's the only one i have . it 's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots ...
your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful .
try what ?
all right , if it 'll make you happy , i 'll try that .
good lord , man . the world is changing . and mark me , it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention . we , as defenders of the right , must keep pace !
no offense , but all i ever need ... are these ... and this .
always hoping . or this ...
you need that real often ?
attractive buttons , yes ? but yank one off , toss it , and poof ! it emits a cloud of sleeping gas .
`` gadget guy ? '' while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses , i am , sir , in my own humble way , a man of science .
wait a minute . now i know where i 've heard of you . you 're the gadget guy .
sorry . did n't mean that . just a little device of mine ...
`` ay , there 's the rub . '' take a look at this file on professor morton . quite a brilliant fellow ... metallurgy .
then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ?
a giant ... hydraulically operated microscope ... that explodes ? or maybe just someone who hates scientists .
put them all together and what do we have ?
eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . hydraulics , optics , ballistics ...
would n't dream of it .
but do n't pull that again .
if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion , then i for one am fully prepared to do so ... al fresco .
you 're quite the wordsmith , fiddle boy . but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment .
funny , i was just thinking you should do the same . since i am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it 's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors .
just another bureaucratic foul-up . you know how these pencil-pushers are . so , why do n't you just run on back and explain what happened ?
interesting . mine say the same thing , and they do n't mention you , not even as a valet , although we could talk ...
your train ? listen , friend , you 're obviously lost . ... i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .
congratulations . unfortunately , my train is about to leave , and i really must insist you disembark .
funny . so am i .
valet ? you jest of course . i am a u.s. marshal .
i do n't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ?
artemus gordon . bach , he 's the composer .
jim west .
j. s. bach .
like hell ! i 'll see it through ! ram the bastard !
time for you to get off , ma'am .
well , see , he had this little wagon when he was a kid ...
he 's not giving up ?
but it only has six legs .
he calls it the tarantula .
my lord , he was telling the truth !
you did n't tell us you had this on !
you ? dr. pemberton ? of course . how novel .
yes , me !
terribly sorry . i 'm always sticking this where it does n't belong . federal agents , ma'am . we 're rescuing a kidnap victim ...
well , let 's help them with that . take the legs .
they do n't even realize they should be frightened .
i could get used to this , looking down on people .
wonderful ! our new friend from the wild west . please ...
here . mr. tyler . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms .
anyone ?
we 'll see .
a new friend ?
fine , i 'll stop .
you know , i really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me .
i try . please , if you promise to protect me , i 'll testify against him . i 'll give you an ironclad case .
you bring the best out in a man .
my . it 's gotten longer .
really ? like general garrison or did n't you hear all that shooting ?
she 's perfectly safe .
i 've had some practice .
you 've ... done ... this ... before .
oh , i would hope not .
would that include me ?
just a little insurance ... against the unexpected .
i suppose so . but life can be hard for a man , too .
thank you . but the truth is , i 'm a single woman in a man 's world . that leaves me very few choices , does n't it ?
forgive me , but you do n't strike me as the social secretary type .
i 'm not so sure dr. loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger .
you tell me .
have you taken a wrong turn , mr. tyler ?
i do n't like to lose , either .
you must excuse the doctor . no one has ever beaten him at his little game .
you most certainly do .
well , i owe you one , do n't i ?
oh , do n't worry . i 've already overlooked the fact your name 's not actually on our guest list .
yes , in a way . i 'm the doctor 's social secretary . i handle his correspondence , send out the invitations , you know .
your guests , ma'am ?
well , sir , you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests .
my ... the wild west .
well , where i come from it kind of goes with the territory . texas .
really ?
please do . i 'm a man who appreciates a good firearm .
i do n't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before .
you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle .
i get that feeling . you know , mr. tyler , i 'm the kind of woman who does n't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room , i 'm tempted to suspend my disbelief , at least for the evening .
my name 's tyler . frank tyler . pleased to meet you , ma'am .
i would , mr. doyle ! are you game ?
would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ?
my friend ?
doyle 's the name , sir . of the connemara doyles . and there 's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself . that having been said , sir , you 're five minutes late so let 's be on our way ! your friend 's already aboard .
that would be correct . orders from the president himself . trans- portation at your beck and call . no delays . although , the government 's generosity takes me a tad by surprise , as well .
private train ?
your private train , sir .
well , captain , then the answer is your train is still here .
look , i 'm captain james west ...
a mistake ? to assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the chattanooga river and single- handedly trapped jackson 's entire cavalry ? how is that a mistake ?
why surely , mr. president , there must be some mistake . i mean ...
french ? damn it , i want my own man on this case . somebody i trust . somebody who does n't mind breaking up the furniture !
yes sir .
french ?
of course , sir , that 's why i 've assigned a new man . and he 's no ordinary marshal . he 's quite sophisticated . three college degrees . a master of disguise . speaks french ...
listen , in two days i 'm embarking on a tour of the western territories . and i want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence .
well , yes sir . a professor morton , but with just a little more time , sir , i can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...
do n't try to bamboozle me , colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ?
he did n't . that 's your job . i 'm taking you off that other case until you 've nabbed this lunatic . good luck . nice train . but mine 's nicer .
where 'd he say he was going to do this ?
on my way to denver ...
... well , of course you can . mr. president , what a surprise . what brings you here ?
and now the job 's yours .
and ?
goddamnit ! what am i doing ? what 's happened to all my cigars ? colonel richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year . no arrests , no leads , no clues ...
part of some speech they wrote for this trip i 'm taking .
nicely said , sir .
we find ourselves at the dawn of the golden age of science . and it is the god-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way !
exactly . any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth . and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced .
but what would anyone have to gain from all this ... ? unless it were a foreign power .
nice to finally meet you , sir .
this is colonel richards .
good work . really .
that 'll be all , boys .
mr. president , good to see you again , sir . sorry about all that .
easy ? easy ? on just what grounds should i take it easy ! ?
easy now .
so , i 'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an emperor and a murderer ?
because i am holding all the western territories hostage , mr. west ! a town a day will disappear ! willard was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , i level all of albuquerque ! yes , that 's right . only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own president will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire !
well , your highness , what makes you think we 'll ever sign a treaty with you ?
the first .
`` emperor miguelito ... ? ''
i 've even printed my own currency .
call it what you like . the point is , i was heir to that land , mr. west . it belonged to my beloved grandmother ! now i intend to have it back . my own country !
that would be ... the mexican war ?
these lands were taken by force from mexico in the illegal war of american aggression .
exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or have n't you checked a map lately ? !
the u.s. is my jurisdiction .
has it penetrated yours that i 'm holding a gun on their leader ?
has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers ? you are in my domain !
you got that right . now get up . we 're walking out of here .
philistine .
he had a pressing engagement .
still alive . hmm . i suppose that does n't bode well for poor bruno .
restrain yourself , voltaire . he 's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant .
you 're not that big .
dr. loveless ?
... and do give me some room , voltaire . you 're breathing on my head ! i hate it when you breath on my head !
talk ? about what ... ? oh ! about who you are and all that ?
why do n't we just cut this routine short ? whatever you do to us , we 're not going to talk .
how embarrassing . did i hold up three fingers ?
sir ... i believe you have only two barrels .
i deal with some tough customers .
really ? must be a dangerous business .
no , sir ... just a businessman .
very good , sir ! i think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade .
thank you . i confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says i can not have .
i must compliment you on miss thompson ... an exceptionally charming assistant .
when you 're three and a half feet tall , sir , life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not ... . come with me , wo n't you ?
i admire a man with a sense of humor .
you do n't know what he 's built ? ! surely you do n't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this .
i beg your pardon ?
it is ?
now it 's a bomb .
it 's a smelting retort .
this is something .
he 's just full of plans that are n't gon na work out .
he ... he 's planning to kill us , is n't he ?
for the moment . but i fear not for long . i 'm of no use to him now .
are you all right ?
a glass eye ? that 's who it was ! one-eyed jack garrison . otherwise known as general garrison , confederate third army . i saw him at dr. loveless ' party , but i could n't place him . he used to wear an eye-patch .
a southern gentlemen . i do n't recall his name . i suppose it 's unkind of me to say it , but he had the most disconcerting glass eye .
who was this partner of his ?
i only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the `` rare and unparalleled opportunity '' to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in texas , i believe . said i could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when i questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it 's sad . so few men do .
we 'll explain on the way .
who were they ? what do they want with me ?
got ta get the doctor someplace safe .
yes !
dr. pemberton ?
right .
well , come on , that 's half a dozen armed men ...
you 're not going to use it , are you ?
hey ... !
in an hour they 're gone !
they 're rounding up a posse . figure an hour ?
when are they coming ?
they 're coming .
well ?
let 's go .
thank you , friend .
thought you might get lonely , mad- martigan !
out for a little ride in the coun- try , airk ?
just get me some horses .
you 're chasing a dream .
then come with us .
you gon na be a hero , madmartigan ? i 've lost half my men fighting kael , and bavmorda , and the nock- maar army . now you and this peck , and that magpie up in the rafters , are gon na take 'em on alone ?
they 're not after me . they want the baby .
it 's you they 're after , madmarti- gan . what did you do this time ?
is this what 's left of your army ?
you managed alright .
you left me to die , friend .
gim me a sword , airk . i 'll win your war for you .
hey , remember ? you do n't need my help , madmartigan . little rabbit trap like this ? come on ! i could open it for you , but i would n't wan na insult you !
airk ! come on , airk . lem me outa here .
least i 'm not down there herding sheep !
i always knew you 'd end up in a crow 's cage .
nothing you would n't have done it my place !
madmartigan ! what did you do this time ?
he thought you were a woman , airk !
we 're going into battle , little one . find a woman to take care of it .
anything you hurl them at will turn to stone .
they look like acorns .
my prsence can not extend beyond this forest . but i can give you these ...
why ca n't you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .
no i 'm not . have you really looked at me ? i 'm short ! even for a nelwyn !
you are very important , willow .
you need a warrior for this job . i 'm nobody .
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by queen bavmorda many years ago . her name is fin raziel .
what is tir asleen ?
you are the guardian , willow . you must take her to tir asleen .
me ?
no , willow . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of queen bavmorda , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess 's life .
she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?
i hope you are comfortable here , inside my kingdom ...
yes ... ?
willow ufgood .
waste magic on revenge ? you have much to learn , willow ...
oh , if i could do that i 'd -- i 'd turn burglekutt into a toad !
go in the direction the bird is flying .
real magic , willow , is simply the art of controlling the reality of others . you lack faith in your- self . you must learn to trust your intuition .
i do n't want courage . i do n't want to be a warrior . all i 've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
you 're strong enough . but you 're going to need courage , willow .
if i 'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can i do this ?
now , you know where you 're going ? down there , through those trees , follow the river . you 'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . willow , this is serious business . do n't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a nelwyn . give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can .
my family found this baby in the river , high aldwin .
earlier today you tried to tell me something , willow .
it 's a matter of great importance to me !
not today , willow .
sir ! i have to talk to you .
i have no family .
we 'll probably die here , sorsha .
madmartigan .
sorsha .
i do n't believe you .
because it 's true .
i love you .
say what ?
why did you say that ?
i 'm not going to let this baby die .
you 're a fool . now put her back .
too bad you 're not more like your father .
i do what i 'm told .
my step-father 's going to tear you apart .
mmmm , i love the smell of a woman .
you 're not a woman .
gawd ... you 're ... beautiful ...
why not ?
why not ?
i ca n't .
let me see it .
i ca n't .
no . i mean yes .
you ! are you the mother of that child ?
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , raziel ?
bavmorda can not transform you . i 've protected this camp with a spell .
as above , so below .
we 're a tiny version of all that ?
sorsha , queen bavmorda 's daughter .
who is that girl , anyway ?
i will ! but i need help !
then you get us out of here .
he turned that monster into stone !
he 's no magician .
willow , why do n't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here ?
madmartigan , you promised me you 'd take care of elora danan like your own daughter . she is all that matters . are you going to abandon her ?
i do n't know , willow .
i know , i know ! but this is a way to get into that castle ...
willow , this is war , not agricul- ture !
i have an idea . back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs .
ahhh !
watch it !
that 's my fault , not hers . i 've got to keep practicing . i 'm still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and --
she 's a bird , willow .
she ca n't be wrong . she 's a very very very powerful sorceress .
willow ... this may be a bad time to ask this question but ... what if raziel 's wrong ?
i 'm used to her . how 's she doing ?
want me to carry elora ?
madmartigan ! i ca n't stand being in closed-in places .
what are you gon na become , raziel ? queen of the rodents ?
you ?
you 're crazy . i think you 're in love .
she 's in love .
well what did she say ?
she asked about you , madmartigan .
willow !
she said lots of thing.s
come on , peck , do n't give me a hard time . you were in her ten all night . did she say anything ?
who ?
did she ask about me ?
the universe is a living creature , like you and me , madmartigan .
i 'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up .
i wo n't .
i 'll help you ... !
yeah me . king ! but she betrayed me . she robbed me of my dream .
you ?
i was in love once , willow . she had a hold on my heart . i could barely function . i *was* a great swordsman ! i was knighted ! i could have been king !
my help ? a great magician like you ? you do n't need any help .
madmartigan , i need your help .
the fairy queen ? and the baby here 's a princess ? and these two rodents are your guides ?
yes it does . the fairy queen told me .
so you 're on your way to tir asleen , huh ? i hate to tell you this , willow , but tir asleen dos n't exist .
i did ?
madmartigan ! you saved her life !
when i left the crossroads , i got ambushed by an elf !
elora danan !
now willow , i know you 're gon na blame me for this but it was n't my fault ... !
i thought you had her !
where 's the baby ? ?
because she 's sick .
because she 's sick .
time to leave .
time to change her diaper .
nursemaid ? !
these pecks make terrible nurse- maids .
hey ! give me that baby !
where the hell did you come from ?
you ! !
do n't worry , willow . she 's in good hands . you have n't made a mistake .
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she 's either hungry or she 's tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .
of course ! i promise !
and give her a bath everyday , and do n't let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed .
absolutely !
fresh goat 's milk .
i will .
you got ta promise to feed her .
you do n't know anything about ba- bies .
nobody 's gon na take your baby . know why ? nobody cares ... except me . you wan na go back to your farm . you wan na go back to your family . i could take care of that baby . i 'll look after her like she was me own .
i hate this .
whatcha thinkin ' about , willow ?
friend of yours ?
i 'll be around long after you 're dead , airk ! you slime ! when i get outa here i 'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !
what is it ?
you hear trouble .
what 's that ? i hear something !
the greatest swordsman that ever lived .
are you a warrior ?
smells like a battle .
these burns . my arms . ouch ...
you all right ?
farmer ! i knew it ! you 're a vic- tim , willow . yep , you and me : victims of a rotten , corrupt , cor- rupt , rotten world .
farmer .
you a woodcutter ?
i do n't know .
as if you care . i saved your life , peck . those guys woulda killed us ! you wan na give your baby to them ? ? they eat babies !
are you okay ?
thanks for your help , peck .
peck ! quick ! douse the fire !
hey ! somebody 's coming !
i have to give this baby to some- body .
why .
do any other daikinis ever come by here ?
miserable pecks .
you be careful . i 'm a powerful sorcerer . i could turn you into a toad just like that .
do n't make me angry , peck .
good . how long will it take ?
please ? i 'm dyin ' of thirst in here .
what a great son you are , ranon . i wish i could take you with me . now go to sleep ...
i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !
are you scared ?
daikinis are giant people who live far far away .
dada , what 's a daikini ?
absolutely not .
ca n't we keep it , dada ?
no , it 's too big to be a nelwyn baby . it looks like a daikini ...
it 's not a nelwyn baby .
courage , willow .
patience , willow .
surrender ! !
time is running out .
she 's too powerful , raziel
no ! i can still defeat bavmorda !
i 've come all this way and now elora dana 's going to die !
just do it !
why ?
get down ! the ritual chant ! quick ! protect yourself !
you did n't transform them , willow , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .
raziel ! i transformed them all ! i 'm a magician !
more ! more !
i did it ! madmartigan ! come here ! look ! you got ta see this ! i did it !
use the philosopher 's stone ! hur- ry ! invocation ! release them !
how ? ?
there 's nobody here .
tir asleen .
no ! change me back into a sor- ceress , willow .
i just wanted to test it first .
now use it .
his will .
again : what is the magician 's weapon ?
we need blood . to nourish the stone . charge the stone with ener- gy .
what 'd you bit me for ! !
shhhhh !
ouch ! !
that 's the life spark . exxence of magic and sorcery !
oooh , this smells terrible .
me !
but what am i gon na transform ? ?
the art of transformation !
i ca n't remember all these things . what am i learning ?
your will ! your will ! what else could it be ?
the limitless power of ...
what 's the magician 's weapon ?
i must concetrate my imagination ... to creat a new ... reality !
we do n't have much time left ! go on ! go on !
patience . concentrate . you will find a way .
how am i gon na do that ?
burn it to a fine ash .
i 'm all finished . now what ?
as below , so above . you hold the univers , willow , in your hand .
i know , and the magician 's goal is to find his true self . but what 's this got to do with it ?
till it 's in a powder . the energy exits within you ...
i hope she 's all right . how much more do i have to do of this ?
we must start with feathers , dung , and a lock of your hair .
what do i need for that ?
willow . to learn magic , first you must make your own philosopher 's stone !
then i will teach you .
that 's all i ever wanted !
you must learn magic .
a magician *makes* magic . any fool can use it .
no .
did *you* give that acorn its power ?
kill him !
no !
kill him !
we need your help . to take this baby to tir asleen . she 's a prin- cess .
what do you want !
i 'm willow ufgood . i 'm here to find fin raziel .
who are you ! who are you !
ouch ! let go of me !
get back here , rool !
us ? ? we 'll never catch them . any- way , we 're all done , teemo . let 's go home .
we got ta follow them .
yes ! raziel ! she lives out on that island !
are you sure ?
me neither !
i 'm not going in there .
he never misses .
watch this . right between the eyes .
somebody has to do it .
elves ! they 're always tormenting babies . they make them cry and take their tears .
here . hold her .
i know she 's hungry . i tried to feed her but she would n't eat a thing . i 'm not a wet nurse .
she 's hungry .
i do n't know much about him .
who is he ?
madmartigan .
who is that horrible friend of yours ?
she needs to be changed again . sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as willow changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re- lieved yet still anxious , sorsha paces to a mirror . willow rocks the baby gently , absently looking at the fire . then his eyes focus on the fire .
i changed her already !
she needs to be changed .
shut up .
if you rest the baby on your shoulder , she 'll stop crying .
queen bavmorda transformed her .
this ca n't be right . this is n't a sorceress . this is some kind of animal .
without raziel we 'll never find tir asleen . we 'd better go .
obviously .
the sorceress .
we 've traveled a long way . we 're looking for fin raziel .
how are we going to get out there ?
its branches are supposed to be made of gold , solid gold .
how do these work i wonder ? i got- ta save one to show the high aldwin .
hey , careful there !
i ca n't see anything -- she 's too bright !
talk ! say something !
hurry ! queen cherlindrea will know what to do .
this is not going well .
why not ?
take your time . do n't worry about the elves . they wo n't come out here .
ohhh , i hate this .
no ! you let us handle this . come along , rool !
i 'm getting her out of there !
you 're the guardian , are n't you ?
who ? ?
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .
queen cherlindrea ?
we are emissaries of her majesty , queen cherlindrea , of the land of coshairm .
not used to hard work . that 's what makes an appetite .
guess i 'm not used to so much .
eat up , book . what 's the matter with your appetite ?
not one this big .
did n't you hear me , book ? pull ! you never had your hands on a teat before ?
good , you start tomorrow .
i 've seen pictures .
cows . you know , cows ?
milking ?
maybe milking .
sure , i 'm sorry . hope you do n't mind me plugging in to your battery . mine 's dead ... how can i help ? what can i do ?
just do it !
john , why ? ...
you do n't know anything ... borrowed your car . did n't say why . and you never heard of that woman and her boy .
john , i do n't understand any of this .
put my car in the garage and close the door .
they 're amish .
who are these orphans , anyway ?
oh sure , fred .
that 's none of your goddamn business ! so keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut ! anyway , they like fred .
you 've got a man here and the kids are upstairs ?
upstairs , asleep . where 'd you think ?
where 's timmy and buck ?
sorry . it 's important .
how could you do this to me tonight ? i told you i had company
pick up the hat .
everything is all right , john .
yes , sir .
nail it !
pretty much .
your hole is healed , then ?
no matter . come with me . we can always use a good carpenter .
it 's been a while .
eli says you 're a carpenter , book .
try the house .
i came to see rachel lapp .
english , yankee . it 's the same . my name is daniel . daniel hochstetler . you look plain , book . very plain .
i thought i was the english .
good morning . book , is it ? you are the yankee they talk about ?
sure have , sam .
have you got your gun on now ?
got to , sam . you and i are going to a courthouse together , put some people behind bars .
are you really ever coming back ?
i wo n't . now run . fast as you can !
do n't let them hurt you .
i 'll be all right . you just do as i say .
what are you going to do ?
listen to me , sam ! i want you to go across the new corn to stoltzfus ' . run as fast as you can . and stay there !
are they going to kill you ?
it 's them , sam . now , sam , listen to me and listen to me carefully . listen to me as you never listened before .
is it them ?
what 's that , sam ?
... i want to say a thing .
hey , sam ...
you do n't say .
that 's luke . he does n't like strangers .
okay , mr. book .
tell you what i 'm going to let you handle this one . but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma . i 've got a feeling she would n't understand .
no pistol . ever .
you ever handle a pistol like this , samuel ?
black ... i understand . what else , sam ?
he was ... like him .
no ... i saw the man who killed him .
who 'd you see , sam ? the man on the floor ?
who 'd you see ?
i saw him .
move ! or you die right here !
it 's all over , paul .
do n't try me , johnny !
you 're going to have to do it right here , schaeffer .
i 've already got something worked out . be seeing you .
listen to me , johnny . come in ! you 're out there all alone ... we 're getting close ... real close ... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in
you might want to pass it along to mac .
johnny
i 'm fine . i 'm going to live a long time . that 's what i called to tell you .
how bad did mac get you ? we figured pretty bad .
you made a mistake , paul . you should n't have taken elton out .
just us .
who else knows ?
a hot shower ... i have n't changed clothes in two days .
what 's your first move ?
maybe the bureau . or those bastards at treasury . i 'll take care of it . i hate this shit , johnny . you cut their balls off for me . i 'm counting on you .
more people ... got ta pick up where zenovich left off . people from outside the department .
okay , what are you going to need to clean it up
just us .
who else knows ?
if i did , i 'd have kept my mouth shut ... it fits , paul ... fifty-five gallons of p2p confiscated four years ago ... guess who was in on the collar ? mac . he salts it away somewhere ... he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists have n't figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .
i hope you do n't have any doubts about that .
last guy i would have figured . but he 's part of it .
well , anyway , do n't get crazy . i 'll do something for zenovich 's wife .
what's-her-name moved to buffalo .
tell you what ... why do n't you and that blonde what's-her-name come over for dinner sunday . how 'bout that .
when word gets out that zenovitch was a cop , all hell will break lose . you 've got 24 hours . that 's all i can give you . 24 hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department .
the amish boy saw him , paul . i 'll make it , but set donahue and the homicide department off my back or they 'll blow the whole thing .
that 's the problem . we need results . the press is driving us crazy over this p2p thing . calling us the 'speed capitol of the country ' . you know the sort of thing . it 's getting political . the commissioner 's getting very uneasy .
if there is n't i 've just wasted the last six months .
you 're still convinced there 's a link to the department ?
maybe .
you know who ?
maybe .
so one of them got to him .
zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists ... the guys processing this p2p into speed .
what have you got ?
yeah .
amish .
oh , he 's good .
how reliable is this kid ?
here . whenever you want them .
where 's my baggy pants ?
i want you to take this ... to remember by .
well in the city of philadelphia , god needs a little help !
that 's god 's way !
that 's your way , not mine .
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !
land ! are you crazy ? i 'm no amishman and i 'm no farmer ! i 'm a cop . that 's what i know and that 's what i do !
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a glotzkopp you can not see ! you 'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !
oh , come on , rachel . no way .
i 'm not so sure of anything as you are , john book . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as i could live yours !
are n't you ? after today ?
you 're so sure of that ?
no . i was being unrealistic . even thinking about living this life .
i was being foolish ?
i know .
there was a time when i would have welcomed it .
there was .
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed .
i 'm leaving tonight . i 'm going to need my clothes . and my gun .
you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you 're leaving tomorrow .
i see . but i hope you have a lot of sugar . eli is ready to go to zook 's .
won him over just like that .
not long ... a few days .
when will you be going ?
i 'll drink some more of stoltzfus ' tea .
but ... you may not be well enough .
sure .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sure it is .
now hold on . there 's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
whacking is not of much use on a farm .
i can whack people . i 'm hell at whacking .
what else can you do ?
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school .
you know carpentry ?
a real fireball .
we had some lemonade and he left .
oh ? what happened to hochstetler ?
eli is a fine carpenter . best in the district . he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago .
oh . the bullets .
the ... bullets ?
you can go with eli . he 's taking samuel to school . but you 'll have to hurry .
i know what he said .
but stoltzfus said ...
i 'm going this morning .
well ... the store at saltzburg ... but you wo n't be going to saltzburg for a while .
no . i 'd want a public phone .
telephone ? the gunthers across the valley . they 're mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even .
where 's the nearest telephone ?
quaint ? ca n't imagine why .
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . very rude . they seem to think we are quaint .
anything against zippers ?
vain . proud . such a person is hochmutsnarr . he is not plain .
hochmut ?
buttons are hochmut .
something wrong with buttons ?
i should tell you these do not have buttons . see ? hooks and eyes .
yes . it 's good that someone can have the use of them . besides , in your clothes you 'd stand out to strangers .
your husband 's ?
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . i have them soaking.you can wear these .
very interesting . i 'm learning a lot about manure . what 's that ?
enjoying your reading ?
it 's not the gun . do n't you understand ... it 's you . what you stand for . that is not for samuel .
nobody meant any harm . the boy was curious . i unloaded the gun -
john book , i would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with samuel as possible .
you tell him . when you 're able .
tell him his tea stinks .
but you ca n't .
listen , thank you . thanks for everything . but i 've got to go .
two days .
how long have i been here ?
what ?
how long ?
only the elders .
does anybody know i 'm here ?
can i have something to drink ?
the leadership of our district ... the diener . bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except stoltzfus , of course . he came the first day . i think he saved your life .
who are they ?
but
gunshot ... they 'll file reports ... they 'll find me .
but why ?
no , no doctor ...
but john ... why did n't you go to a hospital ?
what about samuel ? will you come back to take him to trial ?
i ca n't .
stay for awhile . rest . i 'll make coffee and breakfast .
i was wrong .
you said we would be safe in philadelphia .
you could n't wait until morning ?
home .
where are you taking us now ?
you 'll be safe . you do n't have to worry .
i 'm afraid . i 'm afraid for samuel . i want to go home .
because somehow they knew i was getting close . look , it 's narcotics ... they make dope out of chemicals ... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they 'll do anything . and they can get away with it because they 're cops .
but why would they murder ...
listen , i 'm the cop that polices the police . i 'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . i 'll make an arrest when i know everybody involved .
why do n't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ?
oh yes . she thinks you like policing because you think you 're right about everything . and you 're the only one who can do anything . and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a ... um ... bag of elbows .
oh ? anything else ?
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you 're afraid of the responsibility .
no .
your sister said you do n't have a family ?
what 's a 'good ' tired . tired is tired .
but not a good tired .
i would not be too sure .
they kid a lot .
no you 're not you 're glad , because now you 've got a witness . i heard the other police talking last night . they do n't seem to like you very much .
look , i 'm genuinely sorry ...
people who do n't go into our courts when they 're told to sometimes go directly into our jail .
we do not go into your courts .
believe me , i 'm trying to get this over with as fast as i can . but samuel will probably have to come back and testify .
yes . and i also want to leave this city .
whacking ?
the problem is i do n't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .
now what 's the problem ?
he wants to know who you are . your name . i told him we do n't need to know anything about you .
what was that ?
it 's not a joke .
does n't surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
you do n't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
yes i do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
you have no right to keep us here .
we 're looking for a suspect . we 've reason to believe he 's still in the area .
where are you taking us ?
there 'll be another train . the man who was killed tonight was a policeman , sam . it 's my job to find out who did it . i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there .
samuel . samuel lapp . but what happened here is none of his affair . my sister is expecting me ... our train is leaving soon .
i 'm a police officer . i 'm going to have to talk to the boy . what 's his name ?
make that 1790 .
say again ?
where i 'm at is maybe 1890 .
that 's more like it . where are you at , anyway ?
i hear you . i 'll stay in touch .
you hear me ?
listen , johnny , do n't do anything stupid . you could n't get within a mile of schaeffer right now . so stay put ... stay in touch i 'll let you know when maybe it makes sense .
i 'm coming .
too hot . do n't do it . do n't come in .
never mind . i 'm coming in to take care of business . how hot am i ?
johnny ! where the hell have you been ?
it 's me .
good . take care of that woman 's name for me . and watch your ass .
i hear you .
yeah ... i can put it all together when i get back , 'til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual ...
listen to me schaeffer 's part of it . maybe at the top of it .
johnny , what the fuck ?
nothing . i 'm not going to be around for a while . i 'll call you when i can .
what the hell are you talking about ? what 's happening .
listen carefully , i wrote the amish woman 's name and address on my desk calendar , i want you to lose it for me , now . tonight .
it wo n't happen again .
let 's just find coalmine . listen , zenovich made a mistake . you did n't let anybody down . it happens
i got there late , john .
okay , sam . can you tell me what he looked like ?
i did n't even know about it .
anybody know about this ?
what i know , paul , is ... he 's going to take you out ...
either you 're a member of the club or you are n't , elton . tell me what you know ...
he 's got my number .
you 're the first one he 'll contact .
i admit i do n't know where he is .
you admit you 're lying ?
probably .
you 'd lie to protect him .
wrong .
you know where he is .
but ... if you had to guess ?
i do n't know where he is .
elaine , i do n't want to have to take you in for questioning . you 've got his car , you were the last to see him
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !
of course , elaine . but as long as there 's any question , better johnny should come back and clear his name .
he accused john of taking kickbacks . and you know anybody who knows john knows that 's a goddamn lie !
elaine , i 've come to apologize for lt. mcelroy . he overstated the department 's position .
not yet .
did you find him ?
listen , i do n't know what 's going on or how you got mixed up with him , but do n't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ?
you just would n't . it 's not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
no ? why not ?
at home you 'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way .
god , fred ...
fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him .
what 's so funny ?
i made it a contest ... the one who does best gets his cereal back first . children like to help ... they only need to be kept after a little bit .
you 're not carrying a bullwhip ... how 'd you manage to put my kids to work ?
just a minute . i 'll pour you some coffee .
aganishish ? yeah , that sounds like john .
i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . anyway , i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he 's so ... agaanisish !
you did n't have to ...
good morning .
oh .
yes .
john said you 're amish .
yes , thank you very much .
everything okay ?
i have to help him !
no , rachel ...
you shame yourself .
no ! they will be the judge of that ! and so will i ... if you shame me !
i will be the judge of that .
you are acting like one !
i am not a child .
do not make light of it , rachel . they can do it ... quick ! like that ! and then ... then i can not sit at table with you . i can not take a thing from your hand . i ... i can not go with you to meeting ! rachel , good rachel , you must not go too far ! dear child !
that is idle talk .
no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , rachel , it does not look ... do n't you know there has been talk ? talk about you , not him . talk about going to the bishop . about having you ... shunned !
i have committed no sin .
eh ? nothing ? rachel , you bring this man to our house . with his gun of the hand . you bring fear to this house . fear of english with guns coming after . you bring blood and whispers of more blood . now english music ... and you are dancing to english music ! and you call this nothing ?
i have done nothing against the ordnung .
how can this be ? how can you do such a thing ? is this plain ? is this the ordnung ?
eh ? well then , maybe he can go to zook 's barn-raising , eh ? see how good a carpenter .
eli , john is a carpenter . as well as being a fine policeman .
i know god help me , i know that , eli . but i tell you that if he 's found here , the people who did this to him will come for samuel .
rachel , this is a man 's life , we hold it in our hands .
we 'll pray that he does n't die ! but if he does , then we 'll find a way so no one knows !
did n't you hear stoltzfus ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they 'll say we broke their laws
i know .
that has no place in this house .
looks dead ...
no ...
is the english dead ?
his name is john book .
who was that man ?
yes . samuel ! we 're going .
you 're rachel lapp , are n't you ?
john , lost control of himself . he ... will be repentant .
we 'll , them ohio amish sure must be different . our lancaster brethren , they just do n't have that kind of fight in them .
he 's from ... ohio ... my cousin .
never seen anything like that in all my years .
all right , where is he ?
he 's not in this building .
they do n't have any shit .
weird , man . no fuckin ' electricity . what do you figure they plug all their shit into ?
lean on him .
tight . but i 'm working on him .
what about carter ?
i do n't think she knows .
she say where he is ?
nobody 's going to hurt your son ...
my son is out there !
get back in there .
find fergie , check the barns . i 'll watch these two .
you might have killed him !
he 'll live .
you have no right here !
lady , i 'm here to help you . this man is very dangerous . an armed criminal . he 's got a gun , has n't he ?
no , you listen . get out !
i know . sleep now , liebchen .
i wish dawdie was with us .
they are english . they do n't understand .
i do n't want to stay here .
no ... no . it is just the english way .

dorothy !
now , you just help us out today , and find yourself a place where you wo n't get into any trouble .

auntie em , really -- you know what miss gulch said she was gon na do to toto ? she said she was gon na --
oh -- all right .
dorothy ! dorothy ! we 're busy !
oh , but he does n't do it every day -- just once or twice a week . and he ca n't catch her old cat , anyway . and now she says she 's gon na get the sheriff , and --

now , we ca n't go against the law , dorothy . i 'm afraid poor toto will have to go .
uhh -- yeah --
yes .
oh , i hope we got them in time .
yes .
i know , but we all got to work out our own problems , henry .
poor little orphan , and her miss gulch troubles . gosh all hemlock - you know , she ought to have somebody to play with .
well , do n't start posing for it now . here , here -- ca n't work on an empty stomach . have some crullers .
all right , mrs. gale . but some day they 're going to erect a statue to me in this town , and --
i saw you tinkering with that contraption , hickory . now , you and hunk get back to that wagon !
well , dorothy was walking along the --
here , here , what 's all this jabber-wapping when there 's work to be done ? i know three shiftless farm hands that 'll be out of a job before they know it !
look at you , zeke -- you 're just as white --
you 'll be hist ...
from now on you 'll be history
yes , let the joyous news be spread .
if any !
then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants !
is morally , ethic'ly
if she ?
if she ...
to see ?
but we 've got to verify it legally to see ...
as mayor of the munchkin city in the county of the land of oz i welcome you most regally
you are ?
well , i -- i -- i am the great and powerful -- wizard of oz .
who are you ?
... -- oz -- has spoken !
do you presume to criticize the ... .
if you were really great and powerful , you 'd keep your promises !
not so fast ! not ... .
yes , sir . so we 'd like you to keep your promise to us , if you please , sir .
... resourceful !
oh ... .
please , sir . we 've done what you told us . we 've brought you the broomstick of the wicked witch of the west . we melted her .
... have you come back ?
the wizard - the wizard - the great and powerful wizard of oz - oz - oz-oz - oz - oz - oz - oz !
oh , come on - come on ! we 'll soon find the wizard !
tap - tap - tap - tap - what was that - that - that ? our echo - echo - echo .
our echo .
goodbye , folks !
oh --
i ca n't come back ! i do n't know how it works !
oh ! come back ! do n't go without me ! please come back !
times being what they were , i accepted the job , -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away . and in that balloon , my dear dorothy , you and i will return to the land of e pluribus unum !
ohhh !
frightened ? you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe . i was petrified . then suddenly the wind changed , and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city , where i was instantly acclaimed oz , the first wizard de luxe !
oh ... .
yes-s-s -- that ... that 's exactly so . i 'm a humbug !
no , i 'm afraid it 's true . there 's no other wizard except me .
i do n't believe you !
uhhhh -- yes ...
yes , i 'm all right . oh -- i fell in and -- and zeke --
are you all right , dorothy ?
oh ! oh , zeke ! help ! help me , zeke ! get me out of here ! help !
now what happened ? i 'll bet hunk did that .
hickory !
who did it ? now wait a minute .
oh !
sure . it 's to break up winds , so we do n't have no more dust storms . can you imagine what it 'll mean to this section of the country ? i 'll show you . it works perfectly now . here 's the principle . you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky . these air currents -- oh , stop it !
this ?
now look , here 's something that really has a heart . this is the best invention i ever invented .
well , gee , i try and have a heart .
oh ! oh , it feels like my joints are rusted . listen , dorothy , do n't let hunk kid you about miss gulch . she 's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ai n't got no heart left . you know , you should have a little more heart yourself , and have pity on her .
catch him , you fool !
run , toto , run !
no ! fool , that i am ! i should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off , as long as ...
i 'm sorry . i did n't do it ! can i still have my dog ?
ahh ! ah !
that 's a good little girl . i knew you 'd see reason .
no ! no -- no ! here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back toto .
very well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him !
but the good witch of the north told me not to .
certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers .
oh , please give me back my dog !
all in good time , my little pretty -- all in good time .
what are you going to do with my dog ? give him back to me !
no -- no ! it was an accident ! i did n't mean to kill anybody ! ... .
... did n't you ?
there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home .
and think to yourself -- `` there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home . ''
then close your eyes , and tap your heels together three times .
yes , i 'm ready now .
yes . say goodbye , toto .
are you ready now ?
oh , dear -- that 's too wonderful to be true ! oh , it 's -- it 's going to be so hard to say goodbye . i love you all , too . goodbye , tin man . oh , do n't cry . you 'll rust so dreadfully . here -- here 's your oil-can . goodbye .
whenever you wish .
oh , now ?
toto , too .
... toto , too ?
i have ?
you do n't need to be helped any longer . you 've always had the power to go back to kansas .
oh , will you help me ? can you help me ?
it 's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road .
but , how do i start for emerald city ?
well , then , you 'll have to walk . the munchkins will see you safely to the border of munchkinland . and remember , never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment , or you will be at the mercy of the wicked witch of the west .
no , i 'm afraid i did n't .
oh , very good , but very mysterious . he lives in the emerald city , and that 's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ?
the wizard of oz ? is he good or is he wicked ?
no -- that 's true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself !
oh , i 'd give anything to get out of oz altogether -- but which is the way back to kansas ? i ca n't go the way i came .
pooh -- what a smell of sulphur ! i 'm afraid you 've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west . the sooner you get out of oz altogether , the safer you 'll sleep , my dear .
that was her sister -- the wicked witch of the east . this is the wicked witch of the west . and she 's worse than the other one was .
i thought you said she was dead .
the little people who live in this land -- it 's munchkinland , and you are their national heroine , my dear . it 's all right -- you may all come out and thank her . it 's all right now - you may all come out .
oh . but , if you please -- what are munchkins ?
the munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east .
well , i 'm a little muddled . the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east . and there 's the house , and here you are , and that 's all ...
toto 's my dog .
oh ! well ... .
who , me ? why , i 'm not a witch at all . i 'm dorothy gale from kansas .
are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?
but you could n't have been , could you ?
oh --
oh , no , no , i have to get to her right ... .
but -- what 's this ? i thought you were going along with me .
... you do n't suppose she could really be sick , do you ? oh -- oh , i 've got to go home right away !
oh , you ... .
that 's all -- the crystal 's gone dark .
oh , no -- no !
... bed .
i said it had poppies on the wall paper ! eh -- she 's -- what 's this ? why , she 's -- she 's putting her hand on her heart -- she 's -- she 's dropping down on the ... .
... paper ?
has it poppies on the wall ... .
... room --
what 's she doing now ?
uh-huh .
i had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute .
me ?
someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart .
oh --
well , i -- i ca n't quite see . why , she 's crying .
that 's right . what 's she doing ?
her -- her name is emily .
yes ... that 's aunt em .
... her face is careworn .
oh -- yes .
that 's our farm !
do you know any ? oh , you mean the thing -- yes , well , i -- i never do anything without consulting my crystal first . let 's ... .
auntie em was even going to let them kill toto yesterday for biting miss gulch . oh , please , professor , why ca n't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of europe ?
oh --
no , they wo n't - honestly .
aw , come , come , come --
nobody cares about me at home . they would n't even miss me .
oh --
oh , no , i wanted to go along with you .
oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ?
please , professor , why ca n't we go along with you ?
yes --
why , it 's just like you could read what was inside of me .
no , no -- now do n't tell me . they -- they do n't understand you at home . they do n't appreciate you . you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
why --
professor marvel never guesses -- he knows ! now , why are you running away ?
how did you guess ?
let 's see -- you 're -- you 're travelling in disguise . no , that 's not right . i -- you 're -- you 're going on a visit . no , i 'm wrong . that 's ... you 're -- running away .
stop her !
here ! i 've got an order ! let me have ...
oh , no , no ! i wo n't let you take him ! you go away , you ... . ! oooh , i 'll bite you myself !
here 's what i 'm taking him in -- so he ca n't attack me again .
no --
now you 're seeing reason .
destroyed ? toto ? oh , you ca n't ! you must n't ! auntie em ! uncle henry ! you wo n't let her , will you ?
that dog 's a menace to the community . i 'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he 's destroyed .
oh -- goodbye , lion . you know , i know it is n't right , but i 'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage .
now i know i 've got a heart -- 'cause it 's breaking .
look -- it ticks !
... yes .
yes ... !
ahh -- - oh , it ticks ! listen !
you 've had plenty of time already !
tomorrow ? oh , but i want to go home now .
i knew you would !
dorothy !
now come on - you 're acting silly --
oh ! something bit me , too !
oh ! oh , tin man ! oh !
no . why only -- oh --
do n't you know the wizard 's going to give you some courage ?
oh , he 's just ascared again .
oh --
ca n't that female take no for an answer ?
i 'm sure he could give you some courage .
and him a brain .
it-it-it-it - it 's a huge one !
what sort of an animal is that ?
and bears !
oh --
we might .
still , i wish i could remember . but , i guess it does n't matter anyway . we know each other now , do n't we ?
and i was standing over there rusting for the longest time .
oh-oh-
oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee !
oh --
oh ! oh !
oh - i 'll get it !
oh , dear . i do n't know what i 'd do if a whole swarm kept -- oh ! oh ! oh , there 's one on me !
i - i guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers .
oh , goodness ! did any of them sting you ?
oh ! they 're - they 're gone now .
ohh -- what 's that ? oh --
oh , but he will ! he must ! we 've come such a long way already .
well , suppose the wizard would n't get me one when we got there ?
emerald city ? why , that 's a long and dangerous journey . and it might rain on the way .
oh , dear -- that was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you could n't come to emerald city with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart .
i 'm afraid i 'm a little rusty yet .
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , are you all right ?
all hollow . oh --
oh --
oh -- !
my ... my neck . my ... my neck . perfect ? oh -- bang on my chest if you think i 'm perfect . go ahead -- bang on it !
well , you 're perfect now .
... and right in the middle of a chop , i ... i rusted solid . and i 've been that way ever since .
oh -- well , about a year ago -- i was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain ... .
oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ?
no -- it feels wonderful . i 've held that axe up for ages . oh -- -
... oh , did that hurt ?
oh --
oh ...
... m ... m ... my , my , my , my goodness -- i can talk again ! oh -- oil my arms , please -- oil my elbows .
my mouth -- my mouth !
where do you want to be oiled first ?
oil can ... .

oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !
i think i 'll miss you most of all .
well -- i would never 've found it if it had n't been for you .
oh , that 's very kind of you -- but this could never be like kansas . auntie em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . oh , scarecrow , what am i going to do ?
stay with us , then , dorothy . we all love you . we do n't want you to go .
oh , now i 'll never get home !
oh -- oh -- they 're all wonderful .
... ai n't it the truth ! ai n't it the truth !
ohhh !
they 're coming back !
lion , darling -- i knew you 'd come !
did they hurtcha ?
oh -- oh -- oh ! toto -- toto !
i 'd like to roar 'em down -- but i think i lost my roarer .
are you gon na stand around and let 'em fill us full of horror ?
as monarch of the forest i do n't like the situation .
it may be just a cricket or a critter in the trees .
that noise do n't come from no ordinary bird .
oh --
no , but it 's wonderful for threatening with .
does it work ?
huh ? what 'd he say ?
oh -- oh , come on .
ohh !
oh , come on .
because i 'm still scared !
but why ? why ?
i 'd sooner wait outside .
oh , well , then -- we 'll ask him for you .
i 'd be too scared to ask him for it .
i 'd wrap him up in cellophant !
supposin ' you met an elephant ?
why , i 'd thrash him from top to bottomamus !
how about a hippopotamus ?
not nobody , not nohow !
your majesty , if you were king you would n't be afraid of anything ?
in another hour , i 'll be king of the forest . long live the king ! if ... .
i 'll be home in time for supper !
and -- and i got a permanent just for the occasion .
oh , but -- but please . it 's very important .
it 's the witch ! she 's followed us here !
who 's her ? who 's her ?
hah !
ho -- ho -- ho -- ho

oh -- unusual weather we 're having , ai n't it ?
yes .
yes -- let 's run !
well , come on , then . what are we waiting for ?
it 's beautiful , is n't it ? just like i knew it would be . he really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that !
the nerve .
a home --
yeh , it 's sad , believe me , missy when you 're born to be a sissy , without the vim and verve . but i could show my prowess -- be a lion not a mou-ess -- if i only had the nerve i 'm afraid there 's no denyin ' i 'm just a dande-lion -- a fate i do n't deserve . i 'd be brave as a blizzard --
oh .
... has been simply unbearable .
you 're right -- i am a coward .
well , of course not . my goodness , what a fuss you 're making . well , naturally , when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why , you 're nothing but a great big coward !
well , you did n't have to go and hit me , did you ? is my nose bleeding ?
it 's bad enough picking on a straw man , but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
no , but you tried to .
what -- what did you do that for ? i did n't bite him .
what 's the matter -- gon na let a little old pig make a coward out of you ?
why , zeke , -- you 're just as scared as i am !
well , your head ai n't made of straw , you know .
oh , hunk , you just wo n't listen , that 's all .
well , why do n't you use them ? when you come home , do n't go by miss gulch 's place . then toto wo n't get in her garden , and you wo n't get in no trouble . see ?
i have so got brains .
now lookit , dorothy , you ai n't using your head about miss gulch . think you did n't have any brains at all .
help ! i 'm burning ! i 'm burning ! i 'm burning ! help ! help ! help !
ohh ! ohh ! ohh !
no -- no -- no -- no !
did you just hear what i just heard ?
oh , come on now - everybody --
oh -- are you -- are you all right ?
oh -- oh --
oh -- and i was so happy ! i thought i was on my way home !
looks like we came a long way for nothing .
oh --
well , we 'd better hurry if we 're going to see the wizard !
dear , whatever shall we do ?
oh , he 's been crying ! why have you been --
-- a hot water bottle would be good if we had one .
oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we 'll oil him up .
yes -- there --
oh --
it does help . dorothy , you 're waking up !
oh , no -- please . i have to rest for just a minute . toto !
... along .
i do n't see why not . why do n't you come along with us ? we 're on our way to see the wizard now . to get him a heart .
oh , that 's too bad . do n't you think the wizard could help him , too ?
do -- do you suppose we 'll meet any wild animals ?
of course , i do n't know , but i think it 'll get darker before it gets lighter .
i do n't like this forest ! it 's -- it 's dark and creepy !
i do n't see how . you were n't around when i was stuffed and sewn together , were you ?
oh , you 're the best friends anybody ever had ! and it 's funny , but i feel as if i 've known you all the time . but i could n't have , could i ?
oh , you do n't think we 're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees , do you ?
... just that the witch is so wicked . i do n't think you two ought to come with me because you 'll get into trouble .
and i 'll keep the oil-can handy .
but you 've just been saying how much you want a heart .
yes -- - there .
the other side ... .
here -- here --
he said his mouth .
oil can ? oh -- oh , here it is !
oil can what ?
yes . oh -- look --
what ?
why , it 's a man ! a man made out of tin !
oh --
hooray ! i guess that did it ! help yourself .
come along , dorothy -- you do n't want any of those apples . hmm !
oh , dear -- i keep forgetting i 'm not in kansas .
to oz !
to oz ?
oh , i 'll try ! really , i will .
oh -- well -- you 're not starting out very well .
hooray ! we 're off to see a wizard !
but i 'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains . look -- i wo n't be any trouble , because i do n't eat a thing -- and i wo n't try to manage things , because i ca n't think . wo n't you take me with you ?
i do n't blame you for that .
witch ? huh ! i 'm not afraid of a witch ! i 'm not afraid of anything -- - except a lighted match .
but maybe you 'd better not . i 've got a witch mad at me , and you might get into trouble .
yes -- that 's true .
i could n't say . but even if he did n't , you 'd be no worse off than you are now .
do you think if i went with you this wizard would give me some brains ?
um-hmm .
you 're going to see a wizard ?
that 's where i live . and i want to get back there so badly i 'm going all the way to emerald city to get the wizard of oz to help me .
where 's kansas ?
um-hmm .
they would ?
wonderful ! why , if our scarecrow back in kansas could do that , the crows 'd be scared to pieces !
no , no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself .
did i scare you ?
oh ! oh ! ohhh !
... free !
my , it 's good to be ... .
ohhh --

it 's pleasant down that way , too .
... do n't talk .
very well -- i 'll bide my time -- and as for you , my fine lady , it 's true , i ca n't attend to you here and now as i 'd like , but just try to stay out of my way ... .
oh , rubbish ! you have no power here . be gone , before somebody drops a house on you , too .

ohhhh -- it 's me !
... tin man !
yes -- how about dorothy ?
hey -- what about dorothy ?
go on !
oh - upstairs , quickly !
i do n't know what we 'd have done without you .
yeah --
you put up a great fight , lion .
whew ! that was n't my plan - but something happened , did n't it ?
oh , no !
no , you do n't .
do n't cry now . we have n't got the oil-can with us and you 've been squeaking enough as it is .
oh , i hate to think of her in there . we 've got to get her out .
come on , fellows !
oh --
... to dorothy !
but how can we find her ? we do n't even know where she is . look ! there 's ... .
oh , do n't worry about me . i 'm all right . we must worry about dorothy .
we 'll get you together !
oh , dear , dear .
now , now , do n't fret .
who do you suppose they were ? and where did they take her ? a fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this !
well , that 's you all over .
they tore my legs off , and they threw them over there ! then they took my chest out , and they threw it over there !
oh ! well , what happened to you ?
help ! help ! help ! help ! help !
it 's a whozis ?
it 's a whozis .
i have n't got a heart but i got a palpitation .
oh , i think i see a jijik and he 's fuzzy and he 's furry i have n't got a brain but i think i ought to worry !
you know something ?
oh - look out .
oh , did - did you see that ?
i can fairly hear my heart beating !
did you hear that ? he 'll announce us at once ! i 've as good as got my brain !
ho -- ho -- ho
ha -- ha -- ha --
it 's no use screaming at a time like this ! nobody will hear you ! help !
it 's the wicked witch ! what 'll we do ? help ! help !
oh , this is terrible -- ca n't budge her an inch ! this is a spell , this is !
here , tin man -- help me .
oh -- now look at him ! this is terrible !
yes .
let 's .
i do n't think i could , but we could try .
oh ! we ought to try and carry dorothy .
do n't cry -- you 'll rust yourself again !
oh - oh , poor dorothy !
dorothy !
hey , dorothy !
emerald city !
look -- you can see it here . it 's wonderful !
oh ! oh , come on , come on !
hurry -- hurry --
come on -- come on --
a heart --
then i 'm sure to get a brain --
i 'd be clever as a gizzard --
i 'd be gentle as a lizard --
some -- but mostly lions , and tigers , and bears .
animals that -- that eat straw ?
to oz !
to oz ?
we do .
that 's right .
no , sir !
no , sir !
i 'll see you reach the wizard , whether i get a heart of not . bee-hive -- bah ! let her try and make a bee-hive out of me ! you know -- hmm ? what 's that ?
i 'm not afraid of her . i 'll see you get safely to the wizard now , whether i get a brain or not ! stuff a mattress with me ! hah !
it 's empty . the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart .
beautiful ! what an echo !
well , you ca n't . as for you , my fine friend -- you 're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you 're confusing courage with wisdom . back where i come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you have n't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious ... .
how can i ever thank you enough ?
th.d . ?
therefore , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the universitatus committeeatum e plurbis unum , i hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of th.d .
you promised us real things -- a real ...
well --
well , i --
-- and the courage that you promised cowardly lion ?
well , i --
what about the heart that you promised tin man -- ?
well , i --
what about us ?
yes .
it makes you nervous ?
uh - now , please do n't be angry with me . i 'll - i 'll do anything you say , only ... only if you do n't shout at me . it makes me nervous !
help !
-- ruined my exit !
oh ! help me ! the balloon 's going up !
this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented !
stop that dog !
yes -- ... .
but i still want one .
as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you do n't know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . i could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had i not been obstructed by a heart .
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present ?
i love christmas in turkey .
we cant .
weve got to get out .
count to twenty . ill be there .
but what if ...
count to twenty . when you get to twenty open the hatch . it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink .
just wanted to put him on edge ...
what kind of bikes did you ride ?
like riding a bike .
do you know what youre doing ?
hes going to insert the plutonium .
hes sealed himself in .
we go down to the torpedo bay .
is there another way ?
if i dont get to the boa before he gets to maidens tower , m is dead .
zukovsky ...
elektra would control it all .
the king pipeline .
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world ...
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of europe ...
made to look just like an accident .
not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor . hes not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor : instant , catastrophic meltdown .
nuclear .
she just upped the stakes . all her chips are on the table now . and ms life is part of the bet .
what is it ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?
makes her look even more innocent .
elektra king ? are you insane ? this is her pipeline .
elektra king .
whos she ?
its part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i did kill us . she thinks were dead . and she thinks she got away with it .
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us !
its a bomb alright . were still dead if the trigger charge goes off ...
then its no longer a bomb ?
the plutonium is missing . theyve taken the core !
alright then , brunch .
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens .
when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ?
with this ?
they wont get far . every warhead has a locator card . a miratom device . emits a high-pitched signal on russian emergency frequencies . we can track the bomb .
bond --
so who are you ?
shame you had to spot i wasnt the real thing .
heres your imposter . hes paid off the men on the plane outside . theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility , theyre flying it wherever he tells them .
he is an impostor . theres no davidov at miratom .
the soldiers may give you a hard time . whatever . if we werent around , theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides , rotting in the sun .
couldnt make it . splitting headache .
what happened to len tashka ?
dont know any doctor jokes .
doctor . jones . christmas jones . no jokes , ive heard them all .
yes . viktor davidov , miss ... ?
you new ?
i could come for a second opinion ?
... yes ? ...
perhaps after this ... test ?
then maybe id be ... open to that .
james . it wouldnt really be ...
its just a scratch .
i need you to pass me fit now , molly .
dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap ... it wont just be two weeks out of action .
is maybe ... the inside woman .
the inside man ?
theyre getting their weapons from the russians , but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons ? i cant help thinking ... the person close to king , the one who switched that pin ...
then robert was right about a russian connection .
the report king bought . its a manual . renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead .
the worm on the hook again .
get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , renard will be back . he hasnt completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have elektra to thank for that .
hes not through yet . renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in . hes working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against king ... and you .
now robert is dead . he got his revenge .
that which does not kill me makes me stronger .
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man .
the doctor who saved him couldnt get it out , so renard killed him . when interpol found the x-rays , there was mild jubilation . effectively , hes a dead man .
he survived ?
how many deaths is he responsible for ? how many innocent people ? you may only get one shot at a man like renard . same circumstances , id do the same again .
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?
sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own ... resources , at first . when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . i advised against paying the ransom . i knew it was renard . i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him .
renard .
claude serrault . a.k.a ...
who ?
its a message . he wants us to know hes back .
the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra .
im well aware of your stake in this , 007. if you have a point , get to it .
i was the one who brought that money in ...
you havent been given an assignment in this case .
i took the initiative .
who told you to look at elektras files ?
and now its up for grabs , a goldrush . far more oil than anyone thought .
caviar capital of the world . matchless beluga . firm , yet subtle . largest landlocked body of water on earth . oil-rich . hitler wanted it . stalin beat him to it .
007. what do you know of the caspian sea ?
well , at least it turned out to have some purpose .
its barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .
ive scheduled a medical for you .
shes not a girl anymore .
elektra ? running king industries ? ive known that girl all her life . im not sure she knows what shes walking into .
who buys classified reports for three million pounds .
since oxford . i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world . hes a man of great integrity .
old friend ?
quite the opposite , in fact .
constructions not exactly my line .
i cant tell you ... alright , alright ! but you must protect me !
the name ?
stripped of all your weaponry , you still threaten me ?
your last chance . give me the name .
your last chance . take the money .
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss .
i am just a middle man . i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner ...
who did you get it from ?
i did not get the report from an mi-6 agent .
which is neutral , no doubt .
not the usual swiss procedure , mr. bond , but you understand , a man in my position..
havent you heard the news ? so is she .
in case youve forgotten . im dead already .
you even brought the plane for us . we really couldnt have done it without you .
shell get over it .
its i who should thank you -- for taking that money back to mi-6 . so distressing for m. an explosion inside her lair .
consider me ungrateful .
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .
you think i fear death ? i welcome it . i get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? shes beautiful isnt she ? you should have seen her before . flawless , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed ...
who is it ?
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
revenge isnt so hard to fathom . whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it .
indeed .
i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty .
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream . i intend to finish it for him .
im sorry .
he was my father .
you knew him well ?
a word ? im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover .
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs .
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .
yes .
beautiful , isnt it ?
oh james .
one ... last ... screw ?
elektra , its not too late . eight million people neednt die .
know what happens when a man is strangled ?
no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident .
it runs in my veins , thicker than blood . im going to redraw the map . and when i am through the whole world will know my name , my grandfathers name , the glory of my people .
it is my oil ! mine and my familys !
was this all about the oil ?
he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom .
so you killed your father .
just like you ... only you were even easier .
you turned renard .
since i was a child , ive always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers , i knew i had to form a new alliance .
five more turns and your neck will break .
all this , because you fell for renard ?
soon shell be everywhere .
wheres m ?
not interested .
i could have given you the world .
you do what you have to do , but ive called in m. shes en route from london even now .
im coming with you .
you knew . you knew all the time , that he was out there , that he was coming for me , and you lied . you used me , you used me as bait . you made love to me -- what , to pass the time as you waited for him to strike ?
he used your exact words .
how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out .
i think you do .
i dont know what youre talking about !
you can drop the act , its over .
are you saying ... renard is the man whos trying to kill me ?
we had a run-in , he and i. he knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me ...
... what ?
or did you steal it from your old friend renard ?
what are you talking about ?
a little . does it matter ? after all , whats the point of living if you cant feel alive ? isnt that right , elektra ? isnt that your motto ?
whats wrong with you ? are you crazy ?
i used my body on the guards . it gave me control . i got to a gun and i took my chance . ive never told anyone that .
how did you survive ?
shush .
you knew when you first saw me . you knew it would be like this .
not at that price . time to surrender .
surely you believe in living dangerously .
really ?
i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end .
you had your chance , james . now im looking for a bigger thrill .
if this little show is for my benefit , ill take you home right now .
someone wants to kill me , id rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
two . shaken not stirred .
vodka martini .
i have to go to work .
i dont want to be safe !
no . youll be safe here .
then take me with you .
i have to go .
james ...
... you should rest .
what is it ?
i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met .
the way i acted , in the snow ... you must think im a coward .
i know .
i cant stay .
its the only way out ...
no ! it will cave in !
youre not going to .
i cant stay here .
were alright .
oh my god ... were buried alive ...
no .
you dont take no for an answer , do you ?
always wanted to see the upper lines .
i have to check the upper lines . gabor will drive you back .
you are wrong , mr. bond . in fact , i am the only person who can do it .
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . especially kings daughter .
thats every man within a five mile radius . including you . thats why youre here , isnt it ? you think i cant do it . you think im going to screw up . or get myself killed .
the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue , doesnt want to see you take over ...
if youve come here to look after me , mr. bond , thank you , but no thank you . i have two bodyguards , i dont need a third ...
its not the pin your father wore . its an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ?
its my fathers pin . he wore it everyday of his life .
does this look familiar to you ?
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
how long has he been with you ?
my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . hes decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette .
who is he ?
partially , yes .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
god no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . i dont want to talk to those people . i just want to ... talk to my father . i loved him . im not sure he knew that .
funerals arent exactly memorable .
i havent been able to recall a single moment of that day ... until now .
yes .
i met you at my fathers funeral .
id heard there were some renovations there ... no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years .
how appropriate .
the maidens tower .
the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the bosphorus , cut off the black sea .
mother of god .
istanbul .
where ?
so . my way . no mi-6 , no interpol . just you , me and my people .
this is a family matter ! if my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! now get me out !
this is too big for even you . where is it ?
no ! get me out !
wheres the sub going ? !
a special job . a ... a ... a submarine .
and the payoff on the tables ?
alright , alright ! sometimes i smuggle machinery for her . russian stuff .
no . the truth ! she thought i was dead -- those blades were meant for you . what do you know that she would kill you for ?
a rope !
now ... where were we ?
you are out of your league . shes working with renard .
that is 5,000 dollars of beluga ruined !
as ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks .
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house -- your house . and you didnt even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ?
i thought you were the one in her business .
whats your business with elektra king ?
really bond , couldnt you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?
ah , i see . a purely ... plutonic relationship .
shes no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .
what are doing , bond ? trying to impress this innocent thing ?
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king . and stopping his pipeline .
bond . if someone wants you dead , it is renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .
how high up does this ... arms dealing go ?
that too . everyone does what they can to survive .
off a high-powered paraski that was trying to kill me .
where did you get this ?
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division .
what ? this is not possible .
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state-of-the-art russian army weapons ?
see ? youre upsetting my customers . what do you want ?
have some of the rats nest caviar . from my own fishery . they buy my caviar , drink my champagne , lose to my house .
mafia warlords , diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . a nice little rats nest .
bond , im a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal familys , now its mine . i run my little business , i stay out of trouble ...
you , of course . i need some information .
bondjamesbond . what brings you here ?
valentin zukovsky .
c-class .
what class sub does your nephew run ?
in the good old days , the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing . but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo .
former kgb surveillance post . the dye factory was just a front ; now it turns a good profit .
what is this place ?
bond !
no ! bond !
to haul some cargo . my nephew , he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet .
what ?
who ? bond ? bond is dead .
someone will come .
now you know how it feels . to be locked away , to wonder if theyre coming for you , if anyone will ever come for you .
is nothing . his kingdom he stole from my mother . the kingdom i will rightly take back .
your father ...
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .
please .
perhaps this isnt the time ...
could ... could you come ?
ill send someone out .
yes . au revoir ...
everythings under control up here . are you ready ?
no . it is the beginning . the world will never be the same .
this is the end .
what do you think ?
he was a ... good lover ?
of course ...
why are you like this ? because bond is dead ? its what you wanted .
how would you know ?
so beautiful . so smooth , so warm .
is it ?
warm .
still no contact yet .
any word from him ?
where it can do the most damage .
its heading for the oil terminal .
the parcels in the post .
marvellous .
anywhere in this circle . iran , iraq , pakistan , syria , afghanistan ...
do we have the range of renards plane ?
and expensive . cost three million plus .
weve been pawns in someones game . they tricked us into bringing the money to king . not just elaborate . cock-sure .
please .
what ? !
the access code 's been changed . your card wo n't work anymore .
i would like to use the bathroom --
i ca n't tell you that . it is quite urgent .
why ? what 's the problem ?
laurie , i 'll have to ask you to come with me .
major adamson , i ca n't seem to get in the door .
the weather . i see . keep me posted . i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions .
we do n't really know , sir , but bluntly , our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather .
what about the aftermath ? this so-called . . . `` nuclear winter '' theory ?
as you can see , we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt .
thirty minutes maximum . of course , i assume we 'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order .
what kind of time frame are we talking about ?
well , sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we 'd assume that twenty-five percent of the russian birds get through .
what about our end ?
they want in . seems our friend here was hardcore ctu .
washington ?
he would -- you might as well know . it 's gon na get messy . we got a call from washington .
small army , from the looks of it . he put up one hell of a fight .
no idea who 's behind this ?
you oughta see upstairs . it 's a slaughterhouse .
had a lot of blood in him .
saw the world that night -- random , empty , hideous . god did n't make it that way . we did . we make the world -- in our own image . what else can i illuminate ?
that man , then , he was the first . the first you --
we do n't know that .
god is n't there to do it .
walter . this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors . in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge ?
why , doctor . i did . he was a bad dog .
and what -- split -- the dog 's skull open ?
who is she ? do you know her ?
a whore fucking .
hnnrr . -- like to masturbate . shit once a day .
there 's no right or wrong . but if you do n't give me an honest response , i ca n't help you . i want to help you . i want to know all about you .
wrong answers ?
walter -- you 're just telling me what you think i want to hear .
do n't call me that .
walter --
jon ! get back ! you do n't understand .
what are you doing , veidt ?
you mean afghanistan ? it wo n't require my attention . what i 'm doing here is far more interesting .
i guess you 'll be dismantling russian tanks soon .
life and death are unquantifiable abstracts . they do n't concern me .
what 's your theory ?
oh ? the ctu suspects a libyan hit squad .
rorschach 's on the case . he 's got dreiberg in a lather . he seems to think that someone is `` stalking '' the watchmen .
we 've lost a colleague . the comedian is dead .
the bearer of bad news .
hello , adrian .
hi , jon .
i see what the watchmaker made . i see the universe !
jon -- for gods sake , what do you see ?
space and time . i finally understand , laurie . i see it all now .
jon --
veidts complex .
jon , where are we ?
the south pole . times flowing backwards .
jon -- what ? ?
its very strange . times flowing backwards . . .
cured , yes .
what -- am i --
jon . if you ever loved me -- if there 's anything human left in you -- then do it .
i explained this . i ca n't . that 's not the way it happens .
you have the power to do it . i want you to do it . please .
i wo n't do that .
then do me a favor . if the world 's going to end , it should n't matter a bit . i want you to cure me .
you 're the only human being i care for .
oh god . i 'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you .
i 'm sorry . look -- there 's a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
jon , i do not want to hear it .
please , laurie . not yet . i 've got eons stretching before me , a universe to explore . i 'll be alone . you 're the last human being i 'll ever see .
i ca n't stand any more of this . i want to go back . if i 'm going to die i want to be with -- other people .
i do n't know yet . i should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years .
because you ca n't , i know , it 's preordained . so sorry . i forgot . jon . this , this `` script '' you 're following . . . who writes it ?
because --
then why do n't you . . . do something about it !
always . ever since the day i died .
then it 's going to happen . the world 's going to end . -- and you 've always known .
memories of the future are just like any others . i 've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . you wo n't die of cancer , laurie . there wo n't be time for that .
but you knew that i 'd -- die .
i did n't give you cancer , laurie . not you , not the others . i do n't know what did .
yet you must 've known all along that you 'd give me cancer . just be being with me .
yes , i loved you . i left the earth when i lost you .
jon -- there 's something i have to know . did you love me once ?
that 's how time works , laurie . everything is preordained . . . even my responses . we 're all puppets . i 'm just a puppet who can see the strings . -- thirty seconds .
well , i just , you just said -- do n't act surprised .
then you 're sleeping with dreiberg ?
jon , does anybody know what the hell you 're talking about ? dan 's just an ordinary guy , but he talks to me . when he looks at me he 's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms .
you -- you know about me and dan ?
yes . in about . . . thirty seconds , for example , you 'll tell me you 're sleeping with dreiberg .
this whole place is ticking . does it -- keep time ?
jesus , jon , i nearly choked to -- where are we --
the atmosphere . i 'm sorry . these things slip my mind .
it will happen , laurie . i 've already seen it . neither of us can do anything to change it .
jon , no -- i ca n't --
in the immediate future we 're on mars . i 'm telling you goodbye . you 're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
collect me ?
i 'm not here . i 'm still on mars . i 've come to collect you .
. . . and just how would you manage that ?
i could stay and go .
mm hmm .
would you like me to stay ?
not yet , there 's plenty of time .
is it time ? d'you have to leave for the funeral ?
i 'm here , laurie .
yes . i heard this morning . washington 's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol .
blake ? dead ?
we 'd better hope so . -- it 's almost time .
you ruthless son of a bitch . you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world ?
your problem , dan , is a lack of vision . you spent all those years chasing after muggers , and drug dealers , and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it . as if any of it mattered .
then ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me . christ ! im doing what i have to do to save the godforsaken human race ! !
what if youre wrong ? ?
im not .
and what if youre wrong ?
dont be obtuse , daniel . if i kill jon in the past , none of this will happen . we wont even be here , will we ?
i 've seen them ! i 've seen them in there .
adrian -- you 've lost it .
it 's a tachyon chamber . it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time . there are other worlds , daniel , other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
what is it ? how does it work ?
gentlemen , the past . unfolding before your eyes . stand back from the field . it 'll blow you to bits .
it 's not on tape . it 's live . we 're watching it happen .
good lord . how 'd you get it on tape ?
it is jon . twenty-four years ago . before he turned into dr. manhattan .
i could n't let him interfere with my project .
what ? ?
uh huh . you might recognize the names . quite a few of them worked at gila flats .
the missing scientists .
yeah . see , i 've been working on a little project . top secret , of course . . .
thanks for the offer , adrian . i 'll let you know .
good . be careful , daniel , do n't let up your guard . look , i 'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at karnak until all this blows over . you two would be welcome to join me .
she 's with me .
i do n't know , but . . . in the wake of all that 's happened , i 'm starting to think rorschach may have been right . is laurie okay ?
who ?
good night .
you did the right thing , daniel . let 's stay in touch , okay ? good night .
no . i just wanted you to --
if he comes here , i 'll handle him . remember -- i 've always protected you . have n't i ? do you need money ?
he 's bound to get caught . i do n't want my name coming out . not at this late date .
you know how he is . he goes on these binges , kills a couple of thugs -- then he 's satisfied . it blows over .
i know , i know , it 's just -- he 's back on the street , he smells blood .
us . you mean the watchmen .
it 's -- he 's got some kind of conspiracy theory . he thinks someone 's . . . i do n't know , stalking us .
my god . murdered ? -- what 's this have to do with rorschach ?
the comedian . he 's dead . murdered . that 's all i know .
we 'll tell them what 's happened . they 'll listen to reason , wo n't they -- ?
wherever we are , it 's better than what we left . backs together --
dan -- what do we do now ?
everything 's changed --
those cars . what year is this ? ?
dan , is this -- is this new york ? ?
where did he go ?
he saved himself . he changed the past .
trying to change the past . he said it was the only way to save the world --
what was he doing ?
what now ? fly south -- hook up with adrian ?
welcome back , night owl .
will you two lovebirds keep it down ?
i beg your pardon . . . ? some gratitude .
my god ! we bust him out of jail , in the middle of a riot , and he stops to take a --
i think he 's going to the john .
what 's he doing ?
. . . what ? ?
long as we 're on the subject of perverts . . . i miss rorschach . let 's spring him .
you 're full of yourself . what are you doing ?
it 's because there 's nothing to be afraid of anymore . the world 's about to end . i feel like i could save it .
that 's because --
no offense , laurie , but it was silk spectre i had the crush on . tonight was the first time i 've felt like myself in ten years .
yes you are .
no way . i 'm not that much of a pervert .
the costumes . am i right ?
what ?
that detroit shit ? i 'm so worried .
they 're practically on us . . .
i do n't want to take 'em out . just want to keep 'em interested .
missed 'em dan . you 're aiming high !
all right . mission accomplished .
they 're following us .
oh , laurie . jesus . no .
it 's a peace rally . the ctu 's just opened fire on the crowd .
what the hell -- ?
okay !
this 'd better not be what i think it is .
do n't look . turn around .
what are you up to ?
god , you sound like jon . -- turn around .
me neither . mine barely even fits . the thing is , i try to remember why we did it , and i ca n't . helping people , or righting wrongs , or trying to save the world . . . i do n't know . it all seems so abstract .
dan ! the spare costumes ! i ca n't believe you kept them .
you and me .
would you want to sit out a war ? i mean -- what would be left .
adrian 's headed down to his secret retreat . he invited us to come along . i 've been thinking . if things do get nasty . . . it would n't be a bad place to sit out a war .
antarctica ? ?
i took her out a couple of summers back . scared the hell out of some cows . -- i wonder if she 'd make it down to antarctica .
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check .
the owlship . i ca n't believe it .
memory lane .
enough is enough , daniel . where exactly are we ?
with any luck , the world 'll end before we get ours .
i 'm an open target , dan . if you 're with me --
laurie --
i know what you 're thinking . you 'd be a lot safer if i were n't around .
-- what is it .
one more down . someone tried to kill adrian . . . . first time i 've ever heard him scared .
ohh . i could use some dinner . who was that on the phone ?
the comedian . . . jon . . . now rorschach .
i just realized . i 'd never seen his face . i guess it was just a matter of time . he 's totally -- daniel ? what 's wrong ?
are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he 's dead . he 'll never get to trial .
eight cops ? oh , great . a jury 's gon na love that .
pick a record . i feel like dancing .
. . . what ?
not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick one .
old ?
i like the way you look . it 's strange with jon . he does n't age . his face does n't change . but you , daniel , you look . . .
i do n't mind getting older . i 'm obsolete anyway . why try to hide it ?
sure . it works . i mean , look at this face , daniel . i 'm thirty-eight years old !
no wonder adrian 's rich . you use that stuff ?
play one . educate yourself .
i 'd say you stalled out about forty years ago . nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i 've never even heard of these people .
i told you i was a little bit out of step . a lot of the old stuff i listen to -- it never came out on crystal .
i 'm not his . . . whatever . okay ?
his . . . whatever .
his what ?
i 'm gon na take a warm bath and sack out . -- you 've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ?
oh . no . sorry . i 'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean , if you need some aspirin , or --
you 're sure ?
no , screw that . what you were saying before , it 's absolutely right . -- i 'd love to have you stay .
laurie , wait . i 've got a spare room . it 's empty . if you 'd like . . . laurie oh daniel , thanks , but i could n't . you 'd just be all nervous about --
dan , what are you so scared of ? i mean , me , i 've spent all these years keeping jon together , and now that it 's over i feel -- i feel glad . i 'm finally free to , to go out and live my own life , and --
maybe not , but why take chances ?
they 're not following me , dan . i mean -- jon 's gone , we 're right on the brink of world war iii . nobody cares about the watchmen .
you 'll find something . -- i should go . you and me , seeing each other , someone might put two and two together . . .
oh , yeah . they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out . no expense account . no place to live .
christ yes , i went in for a cancer scan first thing . gave me a couple of rough nights , i 'll tell you . . . how about you , laurie ?
he pulled it on rorschach . . . and rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft .
that 's the one . whatever happened to him ?
oh yeah . the one that used to confess to everything ? hoping we 'd beat him up ?
hey . you remember that nut in the hockey mask ? with the asthma ? what was his name . . .
well , that was adrian 's idea . i know he 's the smartest man in the world and all that , but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
of course , we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits .
damn straight ! we were heroes .
damn straight .

okay , okay . you made your choice . you went underground . some of us made other choices .
fine , but the civil terrorism unit ? it 's a fucking gestapo ! dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
now wait . we all had the same option as blake . it was work for the government or do time .
psychotic pig . he had it coming . mr. ctu . . .
dan , are you really that paranoid ? let 's face it , eddie blake was no mother teresa .
sorry , it 's this thing with blake . i mean , you do n't really think anyone 's out to get us -- do you ?
adrian . its too late . the world is blowing up as we stand here .
. . . and they call me a fucking nut .
adrian -- you ? you killed blake , and --
he 's the one . he 's been the one all along . stalking us .
adrian . what are you doing ? why would n't you let us in ?
do n't know . nothing i can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast .
what caused it ?
the guidance system 's fried . i had to switch to manual . -- some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave .
what happened ?
okay , let 's just . . . thank you .
sorry , daniel . you 've always been a good friend . i know that . sorry about laurie .
shut up , rorschach .
coward . giving up .
cases , leads -- they do n't matter , rorschach . the world 's about to end . if someone is trying to kill us , it does n't matter .
veidt 's assassin . leads to follow . ca n't just --
we 're running , rorschach . we 've got no place to go . we 're hightailing it down to adrian 's .
i do n't think she 's coming with us .
where 's laurie ?
come on , rorschach . gim me a break --
how do we know they 've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
are you saying that someone would risk starting world war iii just to get back at us ? what about all those poor shits with cancer ?
obvious pattern -- all ties in --
what do you mean , frame-up ?
ctu . could be behind dr. manhattan frame-up .
blake investigating missing scientists for ctu . dr. manhattan somehow involved . . .
what new information ?
veidt 's a fool . tried to warn him about new information . sicced his mangy cat on me .
i do n't know if you heard . a hired gunman tried to off adrian .
toilet clogged . short fat turd . let 's get out of here .
. . . that was quick .
hey . hey . if you do n't mind , use the back stairs , all right ?
maybe . or maybe somebody 's finally caught up with us . somebody with a grudge . thought you might want to spread the word .
rorschach , that was a long time ago . i mean , that -- that 's just paranoia .
so do i. so do you .
human bean juice . the comedian is dead .
sure . you got some kind of -- bean juice on it .
did anybody follow you ? see you come here ?
hiya , pardner . long time no see .
my dad 's a watchmaker . i 'll put it back together for you . better than ever .
-- what ?
i can fix it .
janey , will you marry me ?
stupid watch . stopped again . do you have the --
we should get back to the lab . you okay , jon ?
nothing . what were you going to say ?
we should get back -- what ?
anything for science , i guess . janey , there 's something --
jon osterman , you do n't act like a princeton boy . what 's a big lug like you doing in a place like this ?
nothing wrong with ketchup .
with lots of ketchup ?
i 'll say . if we ever get off this looney-tune project , i 'm gon na head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak .
is n't it true that you --
i did not . now get out of my way !
did you know he was back on the streets ?
no comment .
no . we laid out very careful ground rules --
oh sweetheart , just a quick one .
no . no . cut . -- justine , we agreed . no questions about the watchmen .
thanks , no . but it 's a wonderful product . now adrian -- your old colleague dr. manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
sphinx brand . when i got out of weapons design , i wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area . i was thinking : what would do some good in the world ? and i thought : why not a genetically-altered tobacco , that no only does n't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it ? in fact i think i 'll have one now . care to join me ?
that 's right . your meal ticket 's flown the coop . that blue bastard has apparently left the planet .
jon ? ? you mean he 's --
oh , i am , honey . you see , russian tanks are crossing the afghan border this very minute . and we are all of us , every living soul , in deep , deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out .
i do n't know why you 've been keeping me here , but you 're in deep shit --
you 're free to do whatever you goddamn well please . let 's move it .
am i free to go ?
all right , miss juspeczyk . pack your things .
that 's it . this is all a trick , is n't it ? some kind of horrible joke to make me --
six to eight months . that 's with treatment . -- perhaps now you can see why it 's so vital that we locate your . . . friends .
what does this mean ? what does it --
i 'm terribly sorry .
what are you saying ? that jon is radioactive ?
sit down , miss juspeczyk . as i mentioned , the people in this file are all close associates of dr. manhattan . they have something else in common as well . they 've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer .
then why do n't you ask him ? ! ?
you 're not `` protecting '' anyone . these people 's lives may depend on the answers you give . these are all former associates of dr. manhattan --
i do n't know their real names !
you 're lying , miss juspeczyk .
i do n't know their real names .
their real names , please .
i 'm sorry about blake .
maybe i 'll do that .
nasty cough . -- try one of mine . darling , you need to get out of the house . why do n't you give daniel a call ? i 'm sure he 'd be glad to hear from you .
i suppose i 'm serving my purpose , are n't i. i 'll ring for the guards .
what about you ?
i know . i should n't be saying this . he 's happy , he 's content , he 's doing his work --
laurie -- he 's the most powerful man who 's ever lived . he 's changed the world .
stay , adrian . i just -- every once in a while , i need to talk to someone human . he does n't think like we do . he does n't even feel what we feel . i mean -- he even scares the research teams .
he 's a little farther gone every time .
please .
i 'll take a raincheck , laurie .
adrian ! do n't leave so soon . i --
he 's in by the superaccelerator . -- let me take your coat .
and how 's life with the walking h-bomb ?
do n't rub it in . i live here .
laurie ! good to see you .
adrian .
no , no . you got it all wrong . i been on the case , rorschach , i got something for you .
two things i hate . street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs .
do n't know . ask around . i 'll be back .
ctu ? jesus . you do n't think --
worked both sides of the fence . ask your old buddies in the ctu .
rorschach , you 're talkin ' heavy duty stuff . i got nothing to do with --
all right ! all right ! ! -- how 'd you find me ?
terrorist . radical agitator . stool pigeon .
you 're making a big --
edgar william jacobi , aka william edgar bright , a.k.a . moloch .
i do n't know who you are buddy , but i swear to god , you got the wrong guy .
before you do that , you might want to look at what i 've been looking at .
call off the cat and i 'll kill you , veidt .
no . i just hastened the inevitable . he 's been ready to blow for years . i knew all it would take was a little push . so i , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer .
veidt . you 're the one who started world war iii .
dr. manhattan , right . now if you boys care to join me , we 'll go save the world .
gila flats -- place where jon turned into . . .
fate of the world at stake , adrian . ca n't get too worked up over bad press .
yeah , i 've heard all about your conspiracy theories . now i 've got a roomful of cameras in there . i want you out . now . and whatever you 're doing , knock it off . you 're making us all look bad .
bigger than i thought . ctu involved . . .
what is that ungodly smell ?
too important for telephone . comedian -- dr. manhattan . all linked up .
ever see one of these before ?
new information .
you 're a jerk-off , you know that ?
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?
on come on , x. did you really think we were that barbaric ?
oh yeah ? why do n't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside .
who says you 're the good guys ?
cut the crap , x , i saw you down there . you 're a hero . do n't be afraid to join the good guys .
but i hate cops , remember ? except for her .
you 've kept up your end of the bargain , i 'll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
i 'm pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
thought you bought the farm down there , x. glad as hell to see you .
we do n't have that kinda time , boss , i do n't think prague 's gon na be around much longer . i 've got ta go now . i 've got a lot of bad guys to kill .
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you 've done your job , x , head back to prague . i 'll be landing in 90 minutes . this is my operation now .
kinda funny , though , is n't it ? we 're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
yeah , that 's right . so now that you know , you understand why it 's important that we get it back .
jesus christ , gibbons , this is something we came up with ?
silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth , it 'll kill everything in the vicinity .
come on , gibbons , you can do better then that .
yes it does .
they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it , light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that `` classified '' stuff you did n't want me to know about . does the song `` silent night '' mean anything to you ?
i 'm on the way with a team to relieve you . what 's the latest ?
snow covered fortress . army of bad guys . the usual .
you ai n't seen nothing yet .
you 're a grungy little phoenix , you know that ? keep up the good work .
thanks .
i 'm gon na be en route with a team shortly to relieve you . just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives . and x ? you done yourself proud helping those people today .
hey , one miracle at a time . they 're on to me now , remember ?
this is good work , x , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this `` ahab '' .
yeah , i sent you pictures . here 's what i 'm thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it 's swimming up the potomac .
you did say `` ahab '' ? you 're sure about that ?
i know , poison needles in my shins . you 've got 36 hours . peace , out .
my friend , if you 're planning on crossing me ...
call me crazy , but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gon na hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
that information is classified . you 're there to gather information on their operations , period .
what the hell am i after ? you 're telling me dick .
we 're not after car thieves here .
i 'm already on a first name basis with these dudes , i got a deal set up , you want me to hammer it or not ?
one point two million dollars ? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money .
if you 're trying to push my buttons , you 're on the right track . do n't make me question my own judgment , x .
i guess you got my e-mail . i set up a purchase . ten cars .
just remember , i 'll be watching .
is that all ?
crude and defiant as always , triple x. it fits so well because you 're obscene .
up yours .
fine , but i 'm not gon na be no bulldog omega 5 .
i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports .
yeah , i spy or i die .
wherever you go on the planet , i 'll find you . there 's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
how about a pedicure as long as you 're down there . what 's this ? lo-jack ?
what 's with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you 're `` extreme '' ? i 've got some news for you , mr. x , you 're a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x 's on your head .
not bad for a gimp .
you 're one sick bastard . a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . i think no matter which way i go i 'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . so here 's my answer : kiss my ass , hop-along .
if you find out what i want to know , and if i 'm able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath .
what do i get out of it ?
there 's some folks i want to keep tabs on . dirty , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people .
now i 'm the one who 's nauseous . so what 's the deal ? what do you need me for ?
that 's too bad . i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .
i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
you 're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you 're not getting any younger .
i 'm not interested . i 've already got a job .
you 're perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i 'm with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help .
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gim me a break . you 're not interested in my past , you 're interested in my future as some kind of spy .
you 've really got me confused , cage . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew ... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i 'm not following your evolution .
good thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me .
you 're a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
congratulations , you 've just graduated at the head of your class .
you know what i hate ? it 's always the assholes that pass the tests .
you know what i hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they 're god .
sure as gravity . i 've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it 's nausea .
is that a fact ?
you 've got this wrong . you 're not under arrest , you 've been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .
are we done now ? you 've got nothing on me . so if you ai n't booking me , i 'm walking .
oh i do n't know , i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you would n't admit to in a million years .
look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
why is that ?
..if you 're trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .
alright , cage , you 've got me . this is one of those moments . `` many are called , few are chosen '' , that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ?
a fed , i shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you 're gon na hit me with the sales pitch .
it 's your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
good for you . now why do n't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you did n't go through all this for my benefit .
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .
that shows me already that you do n't have a clue . what 's it to you , anyway ?
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . i expected you to do the same .
diner , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . i wake up drugged to find what ? you 've got a `` salesman '' over here reading a three week old newspaper . he 's pulling a 211 with a `` trucker '' , who happens to be packing a cop issue h & k 9mm . i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how 's that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i `` walked '' in ? and if that 's true , why 'd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money ? then i notice how beefy they both are . hell , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . ergo they ai n't strangers and this is n't what it seems . that 's how i knew yo-yo would n't get a round off even if i gave him all day . why ?
looks like a diner .
what is this place ?
the name 's gibbons . you were saying ?
who the hell are you ?
so the odds are up to fifty-fifty ? i can deal with that .
alright , do what you want . but keep the screws on him . he 's a wild card . that could be either good or bad .
why not ? you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid , were n't you ?
he 's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he 's just dumb and lucky , i say we back his play . i put him out there , sam . if he does n't come up with the money , they 'll kill him . i ca n't let that happen .
you 're talking about a very expensive risk here .
if it means getting silent night back , absolutely .
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?
i think we should send him whatever he wants .
ridiculous . cut him off . i 'm sorry gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time .
that 's exactly why we need them .
they 're degenerates . there 's not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over .
i 've seen enough . turn it off .
but programmable . and expendable .
the scum of the earth .
the usual prospects . convicts , contract killers , murde ...
you wan na find out about rats , ask a rat . i 've had my people put together a talent pool . i downloaded it to your desktop .
so you 'll dredge the bottom again . you 've done that before . the results were ... uneven .
i 'll go in with a team . but first i 'm going to need some intel . i 'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they wo n't see coming . one of their own .
how will you fix it ?
we 're gon na have to step in , sam . those cia boys could n't find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
they 're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it 's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night . then we 're gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called `` ahab '' . whatever it is , it cost him his life .
what do you have ?
now you 're gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . now i 'm gon na take the whole foot off . whatchu think of that ?
alright . you wan na eat through a tube , be my guest .
you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
we 're on to the game , ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls , you got your torture tools ... it 's all very cute . but come on , let 's quit while you 're ahead . i 'm only trying to save you a beatin ' .
we 're anti-social . we do n't have any friends .
we seen this kind of parachutes before , you know . u.s. army . you got some friends here , jump out with you guys ?
that 's some accident , hombre . you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard .
oh , i do n't know . it was an accident .
whatchu doing here ?
he gets to be the hero .
like what ?
oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it .
nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .
what do you get if you finish ?
just about anything i want , it looks like . this is gon na be tough , though . there 's no way to save this game . i got ta get it right the first time through .
what weapons do you have ?
what are you gon na do ? they 're euro- trash .
`` anarchy '' 99 '' ?
yorgi masterminded the take-over of three red mafiya clans . cops called it `` blood week '' . he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate : anarchy 99 .
kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in chechnya , they called him the `` finger of god '' . assassination and weapons .
this guy 's kinda dorky lookin ' .
naturally .
next we got a siberian redneck , viktor . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .
you wan na check it out ? come here .
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
slick graphics , huh ? see these dudes ? they 're called `` anarchy 99 '' , they 're the bad guy bosses .
what game is that ?
it 's about your next mission . you need to be debriefed .
what are you doing ?
you ca n't welch on me now . we had a deal .
i ca n't believe my mission is finally over . i do n't even know what to do with myself .
use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater !
by then it 's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
it 's running three meters down . twenty knots .
a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better .
no , it 's like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls .
you ca n't talk to it ?
he 's shut out the communication circuit !
i 'm sick of that guy . let 's stop playing nice .
a piece of shrapnel hit me .
you okay ?
let me .
toadies right behind .
go to the water , it 's that way !
where 'd the damn truck go ? !
he owns a big industrial complex on the river . he 'll launch it from there .
where 's he headed ?
let 's do this .
if they launch it , i know how to bring it back .
did you do your homework ?
let me guess , they had a big white torpedo with them .
yorgi and kirill .
he 's a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .
do n't you see , x ? for the betterment of humanity , he 's going to start world war three .
what the hell are we doing ? we 're doing all this together , trusting each other , making plans , and we have n't even slept together yet .
when this is over , we 're just gon na take off , the two of us . take a vacation .
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they 'll believe me . i 've been lying for so long , one more time wo n't hurt .
are n't they gon na wonder were you 've been ?
yes , i do . you 're right . i ca n't just let him go free . besides , i can help you from the inside .
you do n't have to do that .
i must be healthy , then , because i 'm scared to death . i guess i 'd better get back to yorgi .
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that 's my problem . if you do n't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you ca n't imagine .
are n't you afraid ?
we 'll have to go after them .
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .
why ? you 're the one who believes in nothing . screw the world , or whatever you said .
we ca n't leave now . we have to do something .
no , now it 's about us . let 's do something for us before we both get killed . do n't you want to get to bora bora , xander ?
petra , this ai n't about the people that sent us here , you know that .
what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .
of course it matters . hey , hold on !
it does n't matter anymore , forget it .
wait a minute , whoa . we ca n't go now . what 's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ?
we 're getting out of this place . we 've done enough .
where are we going ?
i know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now .
what are you doing with the ivans ?
i do n't know what 's going on anymore . i thought i was square with that dude . now everybody 's switching sides like it 's the wwf .
i heard you talking . i could tell where you were in the room .
what the hell are you doing ? you could 've killed me !
are you alright ?
you ca n't , it 's too risky . i 'm not much help anyway , remember ?
when can i see you again ?
of course . i 'll do what i can . i have to go , before they notice .
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
no , i guess i 've been no help at all to you .
i 'm busted up for you , but jesus , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you did n't lift a finger .
i do n't know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i 'm in so far , they 'd kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i 'm like you said , a criminal .
you 're what ? what the hell have you been doing ?
i 'm a agent as well . kgb . i 've been undercover for over a year .
what 's that ?
there 's something i did n't have time to tell you before .
we 've got to find out what it is . can you handle that ?
no , something worse . he says it 's a surprise , but i know him . this is his masterpiece .
so what 's the plan with this ahab ? are they selling it or what ?
they 'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now .
i ca n't let this happen . i want you to go out the back . i 'll make up some excuse .
not an option . just get up slowly like everything 's cool . petra , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , i 'm not gon na let you down .
that 's alright , i 'll figure something out .
if i go out the back , he 'll know you 've warned me .
jesus christ . you 're going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow , at six o'clock . look it up . we 're taking a trip . be there at six and you 'll have plenty to tell your people .
it 's a long story , but yeah , more or less .
there 's no more time for games . they made you . there 's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it 's true .
what are you talking about ?
they tell me you 're an american agent .
so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?
a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see .
we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there 's a beach in bora bora with my name on it .
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they 're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business .
do n't even start . i 'll be honest , i do n't trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?
i know where he 's coming from . the only thing i really do n't get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
you agree with a lot of what he says , do n't you .
do n't judge a comic book by it 's cover .
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but do n't say much .
let 's just say i 'm freelancing and leave it at that .
so why do n't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?
i 'm from l.a .
that 's how you eat ? it 's like a gerbil .
i 'm an information gatherer . you wan na go somewhere and talk about it ?
what are you ?
look at you . you 're helping run things now . you 're a gangster . i bet that snuck up on you . you woke up one day and you were a criminal .
go to hell !
the eyes do n't lie . all this has gotten to you , has n't it , petra ? you came in as yorgi 's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you do n't like it so much , but you 're in so deep you ca n't get out anymore . tell me if i 'm wrong , petra .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
that makes two of us then , sweetheart , because i ai n't buying your bullshit either . you 're not like them , i can see it in your eyes . so you tell me , who 's bullshitting who ?
maybe we should start again , yes ? i know so little about you , except that you 're not what you say you are .
hey , you 're good .
you 've got to relax , baby , you 're paranoid .
bullshit . i see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . i know exactly what you 're doing . empty your pockets .
hey , take it easy . i 'm just a dude trying to make a buck .
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
we hung out last night , remember ?
who are you ?
that right ? why 's that ?
do n't even bother , x man , i 'm not your type .
come on , do n't front like that . you 'll put a guy right off you .
i do n't know who you are or where you come from , but i do n't like you . you ask too many questions .
i was invited . what 's your story ?
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .
where are you going ?
did you guys used to date ? that 's it , right ? he broke your heart and you 're still soft on him . that 's funny , it do n't seem to fit with a tough broad like you .
mind your business .
it 's gon na be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why 's that ?
go to hell .
you do everything yorgi says ?
yorgi asked me to .
if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?
so cute . he shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife .
sure . just chisel some off your heart .
my goodness , a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
do you know what a wire transfer is ?
i have japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they 're after . and it 's a mil two , max .
ten is hardly worth the effort . we 're talking a lousy million five u.s .
nice place to start , do n't you think ?
the peace conference ...
viktor ! stay the course .
why do n't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .
you 've been so quiet lately , petra , i thought you no longer cared .
i 'd forgotten how exciting it is working together .
what was that for ?
it all happened so fast . such an unfortunate accident .
what are you doing ?
perhaps he is not all he says he is .
nothing . he had two days .
i thought that was in detail .
now that i 've given you the overview , we 're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
you 're joking , right ?
it 's a stakeout suit . it 's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it 's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
from the beastie boys collection ?
think again , that 's government property . you have to sign for everything . i 've got one more that was n't on your list .
i think i 'll hang on to these .
that one i 'm real familiar with .
this is your standard dart gun .
they come in any other styles or colors ?
miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .
listen to you . right away , sir , anything you say , sir .
why do n't you show me some gear before you get hurt .
is that supposed to be funny ? i 'm not laughing . i 've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . and ar the last minute i get bumped by you , some reject from the ozzfest .
i stole your beat , huh ? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people .
back off , just go away you klutz . alright , here 's the story . the items in these cases belong to me . i designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up .
that 's would be me .
hate those russkie choppers . rattle- trap pieces of garbage . i 'm agent shavers . toby lee shavers . i 'm looking for what 's his name . three x ' s .
you 're wrong about that . i 'm heading out that door right now .
you 're not exactly `` going anywhere '' yourself .
you ca n't just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that 's going to solve our problems ? i 'm sorry , x. it was a kick for a while , but it 's over . you 're just not going anywhere .
i do n't know . i thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is .
this is so typical . i ca n't believe you . i 've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?
of course i 'm serious . i bought it , did n't i ?
you 're serious ?
i was gon na wait till the islands , but ...
what ... ?
well if you 're bailing , i guess i 'd better give you your surprise now .
it 's not about the money , x ! you never plan for anything . i ca n't live like that anymore , i need some stability .
alright , so i 'll get more .
french polynesia ? this would n't last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?
i do n't wan na go mersh , you know that . but hey , if this is about money ...
you have all this talent , and you waste it . you wo n't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you 've got too much `` integrity '' for that .
i 'm having fun , what 's the problem ?
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... it 's insane , i ca n't take it anymore .
i can see that . why ?
i 'm through , xander .
hey , you do n't need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ai n't for going on vacation ...
they came and found me . they said they 'd kill me unless i help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . dump your gun on the floor .
why you dogging me up ?
oh come on , do n't feel bad . you got played , so what ? you 're new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?
what 's the deal ?
sorry , `` dude '' .
is this what you 're looking for ?
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they 've got a of nerve agent they 're gon na unleash .
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
dude , what are you doing here ?
yeah , thanks a lot .
i 'll leave you two alone to talk .
the corner . anarchy 99 .
nice hops .
first of all , you should kill whoever sold you that suit . two , i do n't wan na be here either , so just step off . three , if you had the authority to shoot me you would 've done it by now , so just ease up on the machismo , bitch . now that we 've got that sorted out , i 'm gon na get some rest .
you 're here because your government is putting pressure on my government . this is an internal affair , a czech affair , that you are interfering with . i will warn you once : do n't shit in my lawn . get whatever information your government seeks and get our .
here we go again .
my name is slovo , czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what i say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , i 'll shoot you .
i 've been on a plane for twelve hours , i think i 'll stand .
sit down .
looks like we 're in the middle of the drug war .
they 're all over the place ! what the hell 's going on ?
it 's like you said , every man for himself .
help me with this guy .
he 's a pretty good actor , though .
who 's writing this dude 's dialogue ?
a parachute . this does not argue well .
heads up , man . what 's this thing on my back ?
been to any good diners lately ?
what 's so damn funny ?
oh just shoot us already . i 'm sorry i asked .
you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of --
come on , xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? i thought you 'd get it .
and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
sure , if that 's what you want . why not ? it 's all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
including rape , pillage , murder .
easier than that , buddy . i 'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing ... pretty soon everyone 's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
so all by yourself , you 're going to destroy every government ; in the world .
you think i 'm after money ? i told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
what 's the gimmick , yorgi ? that 's the part i do n't get . you gon na hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? i did n't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .
not bad , man , not bad . you put things together quick . prague it is .
i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls .
and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?
do n't forget goatee boy . i greased him up on the diamond run .
that was for anders .
you want to insult me ? this is my hospitality . pick one .
that 's alright , i 'm kinda tired .
i 've got meetings this afternoon , i 've got to get some sleep . just pick a girl .
my old man , he bought into the system , and it screwed him . so he swallowed a bullet . me , i do n't believe in nothing i ca n't see and touch .
connections and politics , it 's the same everywhere .
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he 'd get his name cleared , but it did n't happen .
you , an army brat ? i do n't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
i 've been here before , when i was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the army base in hamburg .
it 's a beautiful town , prague . it 's been good to me .
you got a great set-up here yorgi . you really know how to live .
easy . you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss .
how you gon na do that with government and rules everywhere ?
you got it , man . it 's stupid but it 's true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that 's when you know you 're living , man .
`` ... try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese '' . 'anarchy burger ' by the vandals .
to us it means no walls , no speed limits , no jails . it 's everybody does what he wants . people think democracy is freedom but they do n't have a clue . there 's an old punk song . it says : `` america stands for freedom , but if you think you 're free ... ''
that 's what i 'm talking about , man ! that 's why anarchy 99 was born .
screw the world . if i 'm gon na die for something , it better be bitches and money .
you wan na see my politics ?
it 's all this craziness ! it 's what we 've been living since 99 , when we left the army . one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who 's politics ? not ours .
what 's `` anarchy 99 '' ?
total chaos , man ! welcome to anarchy 99 !
had to do what i had to do .
i do n't believe it ! you ca n't shoot a cop in the middle of the street !
bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i 'm gon na give you another hole to breathe out of .
he 's not with us , xander . he must be with you .
you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
what 's going on , my friend ?
this is a gift . from me to you .
what 's this ?
of course .
i had to inspect the merchandise first .
i 'm somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem ...
very nice . i 'm impressed .
it 'll work faster if i have an account number .
do n't look at me , x , she handles all the details .
ferrari 's , lamborghini 's ... high end pasta rockets . ten to start .
we seen all your shit ! so you want cars ? we get whatever cars you need . what are you looking for ?
when else are you gon na do it ?
i remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour .
i 'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in genoa and wind up here . if you do n't know about 'em , who does ?
sorry , man , do n't know what you 're talking about .
thanks , but i 'm here on business . i heard you 're the g around here . i 'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them .
i appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house .
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there 's always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?
who you workin ' for ? what do you do for a living , dickhead ?
this pizda ? never seen him before .
that 's the guy .
beast .
storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what i can figure , he 'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to --
we all do .
i wish i could go .
... until he found tungsten .
thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he did n't have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power .
the neuro-filter acts like a surge protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor 's mind . it 's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .
what does that mean ?
so where do you think he 's planning this larger demonstration ?
yes -- only there 's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it 's forcing the body 's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they 're accustomed to . the senator 's body is literally burning itself out . scott -- this machine kills people and i do n't think magneto realizes it .
for what purpose ?
correct ... apparently , adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the adamantium in logan 's dog tag to test it on the senator . and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan 's skeleton for a larger demonstration .
its core ?
it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings . and he is using adamantium as its core .
i 'm afraid without cerebro 's help , he wo n't have the strength to heal himself -- and without the neuro- filter ... there 's no cerebro .
can the professor repair his own mind ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm not strong enough .
jean ... can you ?
storm , rogue , -- you take the south entrance . jean and i will go in here .
it 's too far .
i 'm going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission . jean , can you raise me up there ?
uh-huh .
into the hudson ?
radar stealth mode checks out . all right , there 'll be less security north of the george washington bridge . i 'm taking her down .
he calls me sport one more time , and i 'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him .
what 's that ?
i 'll tell you one thing though .
well , i think that 's perfectly understandable .
hey . i 'm sorry . about logan . i was jealous .
no . i 'm ... i do n't know if we can do this without charles .
are you all right ?
we have to find magneto .
he 's already losing control of his vitals . respiratory . cardiovascular . unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning , i 'm afraid .
his vital signs are weak and getting weaker .
what 's wrong with him ?
if magneto is planning to use logan for some terrible purpose it 's our responsibility to do something .
you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto wo n't come after him again . you think he wo n't come here if necessary . this is a school , for god 's sake .
what are you talking about ?
i do n't like him being here .
scott.. i -
sure you are , sport .
i 'm o.k . i 'm o.k .
shut up . i got no interest in you , xavier , or your ... x-men .
you know , you --
i 've served with men like you before . methodical . systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?
i do n't remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
how long have you been in alaska ?
i wanted to talk to you .
inspiring -- now what am i doing here ?
yeah , i 'll bet you have .
i 've seen a lot of rings .
logan , do you see this ring ?
what is it you 're failing to get at ? are you interested in me ?
he takes himself seriously .
he takes his work seriously .
he 's uptight .
suit yourself .
let go .
not interested .
what do you say ?
were you now ?
i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town .
he 's busy right now .
you should always work with a spotter .
what if they 're naughty ?
if necessary .
by reading my thoughts ?
maybe , the professor could help you with that .
yeah ? well i do n't like to talk about my past .
the professor said you were a solider . actually , i believe he used the word mercenary .
what if i like the pain ?
i 'll see what i can do -- you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you 're going to be hurting for a while .
i wo n't light the cigars - how about that ?
there 's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
some cigars . case of beer .
anything else i can get you ?
i can assure you , there is no such creature in my genes .
the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change .
tell it to the ones that did this to me .
treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us .
i 'm sorry to come here , ms. grey . i was afraid if i went to a hospital , they would ...
senator ?
dr. grey .
i can assure you , there is no such creature in my genes .
i presume nothing , i am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children , senator .
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus , new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i do n't know where you come from , ms. grey , but where i come from , you do n't go melting people 's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -
control , senator ... we teach them control .
you would n't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
math . history . science . english . athletics --
ms. grey -- you work at a school for mutants in westchester , new york . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?
i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous .
you 're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , ms. grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ?
let 's just say , god works too slowly .
what is it you intend to do to me ?
intention ? intention , senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the earth .
the intention of registration act -
gosh , i hope so .
whatever you do to me ... no matter what you 'll make me right . every word i have spoken will be confirmed .
you mutant bastards ...
mr. guyrich has been dead for some time senator .
you ... wha ... who are you ... where is henry ?
in the road to survival , there is always sacrifice logan . we are the future ... not them . we must protect ourselves . after tonight , when the leaders of the world return home -- they will return as brothers , as mutants ... and our cause will be theirs . this is survival , i know you understand that , logan ... or is it wolverine ?
what are you going to do ?
you 're backstage at the encore of creation .
where am i ?
you think i care about her ? i 'm the only one who 's sure to walk out of here .
come with me and i 'll let her live .
what do you want ?
i do love a good check mate .
what ? ... miss me ? charley , i 'm gon na walk out the front door and trust me , it wo n't be soon enough for everyone here .
why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will ...
actually i 'm feeling up to leaving .
they 're all asking how you 're doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ?
do n't you knock ?
i 'll go .
i 've found her , westchester mall .
we were friends once ... but that was a long time ago .
he helped you ?
actually , magneto helped me put it together .
you designed this yourself ?
the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being .
how ?
to find rogue .
where are we going ?
i believe he wants you for your adamantium .
no . that 's me talking . and you know what ? it 's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
now that 's magneto talking .
what if it never happens ? what if they 're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- this place is gon na be one giant cemetery .
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
this . this whole god damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of `` team '' of super-powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ?
the point of what ?
deal .
forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , i wo n't feel any guilt about what i do to you .
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . i 'm not sure why , but until we find out , i must ask you to stay .
who ?
i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .
what am i doing here ?
and you think it helps calling her rogue ?
if she held on any longer she could have .
i felt like she almost killed me .
she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts . in your case -- your ability to heal . that 's why she keeps her body covered .
what did she do to me ?
the sun is setting , logan . you 've been asleep for nineteen hours .
why is everybody up at sunrise ?
alive .
i 'll find him .
enough for a test .
is it enough ?
a piece . only a piece .
is that what you 're looking for ?
it was xavier 's people . they knew .
how ?
i lost him .
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble .
and what do you do when you wake up to that ?
it does indeed , max .
does n't it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?
i know .
i would n't really have let you die , you know . i just needed ...
what do you mean to do ?
this checkmate goes to you . i did n't want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .
what do you mean to do ?
i 'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness , charles . and this one gets a front row seat .
the way what is going to be ?
if i could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way i do . the way it 's going to be .
let 's just say that i am out to make some radical changes . now come on charles . for old times sake , for your sake ... leave him to me .
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , max . what is it like these days ?
still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .
is that so ?
what do you want with him ?
the two in alaska . just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? still tinkering with cerebro ?
not at the cost of lives , max .
i am trying to save our kind , charles . you should do the same .
and i 'll never understand terrorists .
i 'll never understand your regard for them , charles .
herr falkstein -- you must go at once and present dr. frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance . the estate will provide for your journey .
oh , shit .
he is the fifth leading authority in his field .
and has he achieved ... any special degree of eminence ?
yes , my dear , he is .
excuse me , mr. waldman -- excuse me for interrupting . but is frederick , then ... a medical doctor ?
now wait a minute !
i think we all need a good night 's sleep . why do n't we meet next week and thrash this thing out ?
poppycock !
they say , also , that you have recreated the horrible monster who , for so many years , has haunted and terrorized the god-fearing people of this village . what say you to that ?
ugly , vicious rumous .
forgive me for intruding so late at night , herr baron . but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle . these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears . how say you ?
victor frankenstein .
what was your grandfather 's name ?
no !
the grandson of victor 'fronkonsteen ' ?
dr. frederick fronkonsteen .
and who might you be ?
you have the wrong house .
frederick frankenstein ?
... no !
yes , sir . do you want the other cauliflower ?
bring me some surgical gauze , a little tape and some disinfectant .
yes , sir ?
carlson !
he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me i did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
give him an extra dollar .
here ! this cauliflower is useless to me .
no , sir . it will never happen again .
are you trying to make me look like an idiot ?
yes , sir . but i must have taken the wrong one when we came up .
did n't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture ?
from your office , sir .
where did you get this cauliflower ?
i have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed ... and by god , it shall be done !
yes , sir .
herr falkstein ! you have your instructions !
'functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull . '
what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein ?
yes , sir , he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university .
was he aware of the importance of this occasion ?
but i received a cable only this morning , saying that he could not come .
i did , sir .
herr falkstein ! did you inform frederick frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place ?
mmmmm .
so this is what it 's like to be completely happy !
mmmmm .
love me oodles and oodles ?
mmmmm .
still happy you married me ?
mmmmm .
did you see ? ... i put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts . the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies .
probably just some nearby cottage . nothing to worry about .
mmmmm ! mmmmm !
is it that music ?
mmmmm !
all right then ... seven 's always been my lucky number .
mmmmmmm .
you 're incorrigible ! ... are n't you ?
baack !
what ?
baack !
what in god 's name are you doing ?
i ...
miss me ?
well ... yes .
surprised ?
hello ... ?
darling !
that 's my good boy .
good night .
of course i am . now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy .
i suppose you 're right .
is it worth taking a chance ?
that 's a tough choice .
would you want me , now , like this , so soon before our wedding ? ... so near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer , when i can give myself without hesitation ? ... when i can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ?
i do n't want to spoil anything -- i just want to top it all off .
oh , darling ! do n't let 's spoil everything .
yes , but ... i thought , perhaps tonight , under the circumstances , i might ... stay here with you .
is your room just down the hall ? ... in case i get frightened during the night ?
of course i am . now come along like a good boy .
i suppose you 're right .
you 've done everything that 's humanly possible , frederick . oh , darling , i 'm so worried about you -- you need rest .
oh , delbruck , delbruck . was will dien tachlas von dir ?
but you ca n't do that at night . and even if you could -- it would cost a fortune . come to bed , darling .
but there 's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships . i just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system .
darling , you must n't worry so .
poor delbruck ! there must be some way to reach him -- to control that body .
all right then !
no , of course not . i just meant ...
are you suggesting i call him master ? ? ?
why does he call you 'master ' ?
yes , he 's a little bit ... tilted . harmless , though .
what a strange fellow .
give me a hand with these , will you , ayegor ?
yes . i am a bit tired , after all .
ready , darling ?
i mean , it 's been a long day . i 'm sure you must be as tired as i am . oh ! these are my assistants : inga and ayegor .
darling ! ? !
love you ! ... well , why do n't we turn in ?
love me ?
surprised !
surprised ?
darling !
darling !
goodbye , darling !
goodbye , darling .
goodbye , darling .
i will ! goodbye , darling !
you bet your boots it does .
does that mean you love me ?
you 're incorrigible !
i 've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to three thousand .
whatever makes you happy .
i hope you like large weddings .
oh , nice .
mother 's going to help me with the invitations .
very ... .very !
will you miss me ?
oh , darling -- so will i .
oh , darling -- i 'll count the hours that you 're away .
i promise .
promise ? ?
yes .
call me from new york before you leave ? ?
yes , do n't worry .
and your passport ?
yes .
you have your tickets ?
of course .
darling ! ... you will be careful ! ?
elizabeth ! ? ! 'ca n't waits any longer . arrive in your arms at ten tonight . ' oh , god ! not tonight .
this wire came while you were gone . your fiancee will be arriving any moment .
what are you waiting around for , pickle puss ?
good .
i put her in the guest room , just down the hall .
i do n't think so . is my assistant taken care of ?
will there be anything else ?
well ... we 'll see .
i think you must be mistaken , sir .
surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place ?
this is the only library i know of .
well , there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will . these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study .
i do n't know what you mean , sir .
i see . and where is my grandfather 's private library ?
yes , this was victor 's ... the baron 's medical library .
there seem to be quite a few books .
may i have it , please ?
no ! dr. frankenstein always kept that separate .
yes ! ... the laboratory .
you mean ... the laboratory ? ?
does that include the key to the laboratory ?
you 'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas ... all the rooms in your castle on this ring . i 'll leave it on the table here .
it seems fine .
i hope you find this comfortable . this was baron victor 's room .
saturday night , yes , sir . have a pleasant journey !
saturday night then ! i 'll take the train to new york and fly from there .
not at all -- a great privilege , doctor .
well , thank you very much for all your trouble .
one week -- i 'll see to it , sir .
one week at the most ! ?
yes , sir .
all right then , i suppose i owe the family that much . you 'll have everything ready for me when i arrive ?
the old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee .
i did n't do that .
break that old man 's violin .
what ?
why did you do that ?
well ... if you 're sure that i could accomplish everything in a week ... i suppose i could manage it .
i 'll have to think it over . it 's not so easy just to pick up and ...
a week . ten days at most .
how long will this whole thing take ?
do you have a hundred thousand of them , sir ?
but i ca n't just drop everything and leave . i have responsibilities and obligations .
oh , at least , sir . the land alone is worth a small fortune .
my name is gerhart falkstein .
fron kon steen !
dr. frankenstein ?
my grandfather 's work was doo-doo ! dead is dead ! there 's only one thing i am interested in ... and that is the preservation of life !
but your grandfather 's work , sir ...
you have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system ,
i am a scientist ... ! not a philosopher .
but , sir ...
hearts and kidneys are tinker toys ! i 'm talking about the central nervous system .
but look at what 's been done with hearts and kidneys !
nineteen ! my dear young man ... once the human organism has ceased to function , nature has deemed that creature to be dead .
nineteen , sir .
how old are you , young man ?
yes , but , sir ... if it could be accomplished , would n't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ?
you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind .
but are n't you the least bit curious about it , doctor ? does n't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you ?
my father was a sick man .
but was n't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work , sir ... ? the re-animation of component parts ?
are you speaking of the worm , or ... the spaghetti .
vermicelli .
a piece of what ?
is n't it true that darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until , by some extraordinary means , it actually began to move with voluntary motion ?
yes ?
dr. fronkonsteen !
in conclusion ... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious , because ... once a nerve fibber is severed ... there is no way to regenerate life back into it . are there any more questions before we leave ?
very good ! since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction ... why do n't we proceed ?
well sir ... i 'm not sure i understand the distinction between 'reflexive ' and 'voluntary ' nerve impulses .
i prefer , by far , to be remembered for my own small contributions to science . now if we can proceed to your questions .
that 's true ! but my grandfather , victor was , after all , what we might politely refer to as ... a cuckoo !
but are n't you the grandson of the famous dr. victor frankenstein ? ... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ?
no , it 's dr. fronkonsteen !
oh ! i thought it was dr. frankenstein .
my name is pronounced fron kon steen .
i beg your pardon ?
that 's 'fronkonsteen . '
okay , boss ! but i hope you know what you 're doing .
it 's the only way .
yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ?
is everything ready ?
come on , big fellow !
i 'll bet it 's a doozy .
there 's only one way .
i like your style , master . how do we get him here ?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid ...
that sound good , boss .
no ! the only hope now is to get him back here . if i can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum ...
he 's carrying her off now through the woods .
what ? ? ?
you do n't understand , master . the big fellow 's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee .
what d'ya mean `` what monster ? ' you remember ... the one we madein the basement .
what monster ?
come on , froderick -- none of that .
i 'm a failure .
that 's what we 're paid for .
thanks ... for all your help .
maybe ... if you get here on time .
can you play it ?
bring -- me -- the -- violin !
how do you know it was a 'she ' ?
all right -- where is she ?
how do you know it was a 'he ' ?
where is he ?
someone was playing this in the music room .
what did you find out ?
how 's it going ?
act casual !
yes , master !
ayegor ! find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can .
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks .
... whew ! i 'm glad that 's over with .
no , no ! that whole thing !
... i 'm glad that 's ...
repeat it anyway -- it 's a wonderful cue .
i 'm not trying to be funny .
what 's the point of my setup ? it 's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said .
why ?
you 're just supposed to repeat what you said .
yes .
you can say that again .
whew ! i 'm glad that 's over with .
give -- me -- your -- hand !
original .
careful , master -- you never can tell with these chaps .
but do n't you see ... the brain of hans delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us . i 've got to untie it .
do n't fall for that one .
it 's trying to talk . it wants us to take off the straps .
i suppose you 're right . inga ! prepare a sedative , just in case .
better not get too close , master . this guy could kill you .
it was n't me .
but you did -- i just heard it .
i did n't make a 'yummy ' sound -- i just asked what it was .
to you ! you just made a 'yummy ' sound , so i thought you liked the dessert .
who are you talking to ?
oh , do you like it ? i 'm not partial to desserts , but this is excellent .
you 're right ! self-pity never got anyone anywhere . let 's go back and finish our dinner .
i 'm not that sort you know . i appreciate you feelings , but try to show them some other way .
i 'm sorry . i do n't mean to take out my frustration on you . you 've been a great help to me , and i 've let you down .
you 'll be getting me sad next .
well , i do n't like to see you mope .
do n't try to cheer me up that way .
you must n't take it so hard . bucharest was n't built in a day .
cold ! cold and dead !
but there must be a reason . this is science , not art .
you ca n't win 'em all .
wait till he sees the bill .
throw the third switch !
what ?
more , do you hear me ?
what ?
it 's not enough . more ! more , do you hear me ?
this guy means business .
throw the second switch !
you 've got it , master .
yes ! when i give the word -- throw the first switch !
tonight ?
the ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing . we shall penetrate into the recesses of nature . we shall ascend into the heavens . we shall command the thunders of heaven , mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows .
all right ... elevate me !
you 'd better hurry -- i think it 's going to rain .
yes , master . just do n't turn on any radios .
yes ! it 's all written down in the notes . tie off the kites and come down !
you 're sure you know what you 're doing ?
thank you , master .
if you like -- just hurry !
it 's always been one of my favorite names .
why ?
oh ! may i call you 'master ' ?
he only died two weeks ago -- i 'm sure they 'll still have him . hurry now . i 'll prepare the body .
i 'm getting excited just thinking about it . what if he 's not there ?
can you imagine that brain in this body ?
that 's not bad .
and he wrote seventeen cookbooks .
hmm !
was he any good ? ? ? he was the finest natural philosopher , internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century .
was he any good ?
i want that brain .
yes . dr. h. delbruck .
do you have the name i wrote down ?
i have a pretty good idea .
very little decay . with this magnificent specimen for a body , all we need now is an equally magnificent brain . you know what to do !
could be raining !
how ?
could be worse !
what a filthy job !
yes , i think we could all use a good laugh .
taking the book along ?
funny it should just be lying out here on the table . i wonder what kind of dribble this is ?
'how i did it . ' good title !
it is ! this was my grandfather 's private library . look at this !
must be the music room .
what is this place ?
no , but when i first came in , there was a light coming from behind that steel door .
did you see anyone else down here ?
two switches over there , but i was n't going to be the first .
you did n't hear ... nothing ! are n't there any lights in this place ?
what ?
it seems that way . you did n't hear any music at all ?
did you hear that strange music ?
what ?
did you hear that strange music ? ?
what ?
did you hear that strange music ?
just putting up some tea .
but what you were doing ?
i got frightened all alone upstairs , so i came down here .
what are you doing here ?
fro-derick !
aye-gor !
i wonder what 's got into them ?
down ! get down , you beasts !
home .
home !
go ahead , play dumb ! you 'll lose your sockers and then be fockers .
wockers with the knockers ? ? ?
the wockers with the knockers .
what wockers ?
suit yourself ... i 'm easy . better watch out for the wockers .
no .
i thought you wanted to .
why are you talking like that ?
there wolf ! there castle !
i beg your pardon ?
there .
what hump ?
incidentally -- i do n't mean to embarrass you in any way , but i 'm a rather brilliant surgeon . perhaps i can help you with that hump .
yes , just the two .
are these your bags ?
how do you do ?
this is inga . they thought you might need an assistant temporarily .
i 'm sure we will .
yes , that 's right . my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together . you and i should have a lot of laughs .
you were sent by herr falkstein , were n't you ?
well , they were wrong then , were n't they ?
but they told me it was ee gor .
no , it 's pronounced aye gor .
you must be igor .
i see .
it 's not . it 's fredereck fronkonsteen .
why is n't it frodereck fronkon steen ?
no , fred ereck .
and do you also say fro dereck ?
no , it 's pronounced fron kon steen .
are you putting me on ?
fron kon steen !
frederick frankenstein ?
do n't you think i know that ? but what are you judging by ? bucharest ? ? ? this was always a hick town . they ca n't get a 'bus and truck ' company to come in here . are you going to let these idiots get the best of you ? ... or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you 've got more dignity in your little finger than they 've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together ?
mmmmmmmmm .
wait ! stop ! do n't give them the satisfaction . i know it 's tough , but look at how far we 've come ! are you going to throw it all away now ? ?
mmmmmmmmmm ! mmmmmmmmmmmm !
for god 's sake -- go on ! are you trying to make me look like a fool . sing , you amateur ! sing ! !

it 's an honor for me , sir . you play the violin ?
may i see your violin ?
how sweet ! such a quaint little tune .
zis is an old transylvanian lullaby .
what 's that tune that you 're playing
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm !

i love it when you 're excited . come then , my apfelstrudel ! come into my arms and let me hold you .

are you ready for me ?
yes , sweetie ... i heard you . so ! i 'm ready for you , meine liebe .
mmmmmmmmm !
mmmmm .
all right if i turn out the lamp , sweetheart ?
... but an intellectual relationship , like this -- we could have as often as we wanted . three times a day -- anything !
yes , i will .
you 've got to help me to remain faithful .
yes , i know .
it would n't be fair to her .
yes , i know .
well ... ... perhaps for a few minutes .
why do n't we talk inside ?
yes ... yes , you have yours .
and i have mine .
yes , i have mine .
but , after all , you have yours .
yes , elizabeth has hers .
and elizabeth has hers .
we all have our feelings . i know that i have mine . and ... i would n't want to hurt yours .
no . nor to elizabeth .
nor to elizabeth .
i say , it would n't be fair to you ... or to me .
what ?
of course not .
it would n't be fair to elizabeth .
i know frederick .
there can never ... ever ... be anything physical between us . you know that , dear .
i see what you mean .
i know , but i mean -- not fooling around physically ? ... or not fooling around intellectually ?
not fooling around .
it 's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity ... ultimately ?
i 've missed you intellectually , too , doctor .
oh , a little . but it 's not just physical loneliness . it 's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually ... as i have you .
what 's wrong , doctor ? you seem ... lonely .
just passing through the night .
wonderful ? it 's terrible ! terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible !
why , doctor ... how wonderful for you .
good night !
good night , doctor .
good ! it should n't take more than a few seconds .
i think so .
did you do it ?
oh ! yes , doctor .
give him the sedative !
are you serious ? ?
all right -- give it to him !
stop -- singing ! ! !
it has a pas-sion , 'the con-ti nen-tal ... '
it 's some-thing dar-ing , 'the con-ti-nen-tal , ' a way of danc-ing that 's real-ly ul-tra new ; it 's ver-y sub-tle , 'the con-ti-nen-tal . '
this is not the finals -- just sing !
i 'd be so nervous .
yes -- quickly , dear !
me ? sing ?
do you think you can sing it ?
i think i 'll ... carry him .
what are you going to do ?
what do you think we should do ?
it looks that way .
alive ! look at it . i have defeated death !
i think you 've done it , master .
oh , doctor !
look here - if it was n't you , and it was n't you , and it was n't me ...
it was n't me .
i do n't understand -- i followed the notes to the letter .
i thought it was wonderful .
reputation . reputation !
oh ! yes , doctor .
raise the platform , hurry !
right here ?
i know .
yes !
a god ?
oh , frederick ... you 're not only a great doctor , you 're a great ... you 're almost a ...
soon , all the electrical secrets of heaven shall be mine .
'dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals . '
and look at this , doctor !
'as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed , i resolved to make the creature of a gigantic stature . ' of course ! that would simplify everything .
perhaps we 'd better leave .
oh , doctor !
but who was playing it ?
well , this explains the music .
look , doctor !
what a filthy mess .
ooh !
all right then , quietly ! close your robe and stay right behind me . do n't make a sound !
let me come with you , doctor , please ! i do n't want to stay up here alone .
whatever it is , it 's coming from down there . i 'm going down to see .
dr. fronkonsteen -- look !

inga !
well ... i 'll just finish unpacking .

would you like a sandwich ?
well.. i suppose it would be all right , for just a little while .
oh please -- just till i get sleepy . then you can force me right back to my room .
well ...
i know , but usually i can fall asleep right away . it must be the strange room .
we only arrived a few minutes ago .
could i lie down in your bed for a little while ? i just ca n't sleep .
that 's quite all right . what is it , dear ?
are you busy ?
just an atmospheric discharge . nothing to be afraid of .
sometimes i 'm afraid of the lightning .
i 'm not sure i ... get your drift .
did you ever have a roll in the hay ?
yes , thank you . it was n't bad .
did you have a pleasant trip ?
how nice .
extremely well .

another fifteen seconds to go .
igor -- the clock ! hurry !

sounds like visitors . it 's all right -- frau blucher will show them in .

absolutely ! may my mother grow two heads if i 'm not telling the truth .
igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain ? are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of hans delbruck that night ?
oh , igor -- i 'm so afraid ! i just hope this all ends well .
what d'ya want to do to kill time ?
yes .
three minutes to go !
four
how long is it so far ?
the doctor said to allow seven minutes : no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed .
how do you know they 're done ?
why certainly . do n't you , frau blucher ?
i think the doctor is a genius ! do n't you , igor ?
you ca n't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night .
look how far we 've come .
why do n't we all turn in ? it 's been a long day .
i 'm getting tired .
do you know the theme from 'doctor zhivago ' ?
it 's working ! oh , doctor -- you play beautifully .
whew ! a nineteen-inch drill .
his schwanzstucker .

zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains . they 'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses .
why don 't the zulus attack ?
one zulu is only one man.. ..and i 'm afeared of no one man ... but the zulu , they come in the thousands ... . like a black wave of death ... . in the thousands ... . and them assegais ... . stabbing !
you afeared of the zulus then , quartermaster ?
could be . across the river into zululand . . they might just be waiting there for us to show up ... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies ! ... .
will we be fighting the zulus soo~ , quartermaster ? .
so , you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken .
from the cook , sir they saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning , made their tea taste of lifebuoy toilet soap , they saij handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier . 2t
i listened extra careful to your `` stand to '' this mornin ' , boy . ft was peifecl i could n't 've done it better meseif , not even when i was bugler to the duke of wellington.. .now tell me , where did you get that black eye ?
will you hear `` last post '' , sir ?
our friend colonel dumford will be should be at this minute approaching pulleine . i think we 'll eat here . i want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour . .
eleven o'clock , my lorj 42
what o'clock is it , mr noggs ?
my only fear is that the zulu will avoid the engagement
so attack is your defence . well let 's hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction .
do not confuse yourse { fi why ? we must strike a heavy blow . this can not be a war of manoeuvre .
if i 've got it right , my lord , you lead an invasion into zululand , for i see it all around me , but `` why ? '' is the question my readers will ask . `` why ? ''
tell what you see . write it well , sir , and make sure you get it right
they spurred onto high ground , my lord , full of spirit and looking for the zulu . full of sport they were , my lord .
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory ?
indeedldid , mylord . itwas one ofthe first to cross .
1 saw you lead our cavalry sir
excuse me , my lord . norris-newman , of `` the standard '' , my lord .
an historical moment , gentlemen .
and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists ? 40
tomorrow we will continue our advance on ulundi . dumford , kindly return to your unit bring them here immediately to support pulleine . mr vereker will join you as adc . do you understand me clearly ?
i 'm explaining my reasons .
are you dictating the strategy of this war , sir ?
intelligence ? sources of your own ? did it not occur to you they may be native rumours ? rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofnatal open to a possible counter thrust
i have received intelligence from , sources of my own that the zulu impis are moving north of here and threaten your left .
you intended to bring your reserves across the river ?
my lord . this list was prepared for you . i don 't think another can understand its true value .
excellent . thank you . give them to crealock , would you ?
i thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks zulu .
oh ... indeed . crealock , we should see that colonel dumford has an officer for his hard riders . perhaps a subaltern from the twenty fourth .
they come well recommended do they ? durnford
sikali horse , my lord . christians all i know each one by name .
splendid horsemanship who are they ?
certainly , sin
splendid site , crealock , splendil i want to establish camp here immediately .
a large party of zulus have been sighted in the direction of the king 's kraal getting up , chelmsford moves over to look at the map on his desk .
yes ?
thank you .
the only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the royal kraal , at ulundi .
our runners bare his dispatches , do they not ?
er , called noggs , sir actual name is norris-newman . he presented credentials from `` the standard '' .
what 's that strange name the newspaper chap 's called ?
but will they make good use of them ?
yes . i see you 've issued each of them with a martini henry carbine . our quota for native contingencies : one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle .
right . bombardier , to me please .
well , fed or hungry , pulleine wants them in position immediately . .
well , my horses are feeding , as you may observe , mr coghill . it 'll take a little while .
how quickly can you move your artillery forward ?
yes .
stuart ?
keep steady . you 're the best shots of the twenty-fourth . you bunch of heathens , do it
choose your targets men . that 's right watch those markers . 55
ft could be you flatter yourself coghill it 's that odd eye .
well that one . the one who keeps looking at me .
which one ?
do you think she might be interested in someone ?
well that 's typical of her majesty 's army . appoint an engineer to do a soldier 's work .
um . there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make durnford second in command .
lighting coghill ' 5 cigar : our good colonel dumford scored quite a coup with the sikali horse .
so far only their scouts . but we have had reports of a small impi farther north , over there .
and i assure you , you do not in fact i 'd be obliged for your best advice . what have your scouts seen ?
well i assure you , sir , i have no desire to create difficulties . 45
i think chelmsford wants a good man on the border why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady commander in reserve .
lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos .
i 'm to take the sikali with the main column to the river
your orders , mr vereker ?
good ones , yes , mr vereker . gentlemen who can ride and shoot
colonel durnford ... william vereker . i hear you 've been seeking officers ?
