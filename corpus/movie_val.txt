you got ta tell me where she is .
around somewhere . listen , i 'm in kind of a hurry , johnny u. what can i do for you ?
where 's roach ?
good guess . there 's a gun on you right now .
but you 're not alone .
i 'm not armed .
wild , ai n't it ? ! see , we exist on a higher plane , you and i. we make our own rules . why be a servant of the law johnny u ... when you can be it 's master ?
bodhi , this is your wake up call , man -- i ... am ... an ... eff ... bee ... eye ... agent ! !
sure you can ! you may even like it ... it 's a killer rush . you 'll see . hey , do n't i show you things , johnny u ?
i ca n't do this .
see ! that 's what i like about you , man ! you 're just sharp as a razor blade .
we 're wasting time .
sorry , ca n't do it , brah . he 's on the road . and where they 're going there 's no phones . damn , i hate this johnny , i really do . i hate violence . see , that 's why i need rosie . i could never make this thing work , myself . no way i could hold a knife to tyler 's throat , man ! she was my woman , once . we shared time in this world . but rosie , he 's kind of a ... mechanism . once you set him in motion , he wo n't stop . that 's his gift , a kind of ... blankness . noon comes , straight up , he 'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes . nothing i can do , unless i get there .
you call him ... right now ... and tell him to let her go .
she 'll be fine , rosie wo n't do anything . at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time , about ... let 's see ... ... six hours from now .
talk .
whoa , whoa ! ! think it through ! i 'm the only one knows where they are . just let me talk for a second .
you 're a fucking dead man --
insurance policy . now this is going to sting a bit , but it 's for your own growth , brah . press play .
what 's this ?
okay !
you first !
one thousand feet . pull the goddamn cord !
you do it ... you first !
do n't screw around man , pull it !
after you , alfonse . i insist !
you gon na pull ?
i 'll take that as a yes .
whoooaaah ! shhiiittt ! whoooaaah !
utah , you copy bruddah ?
my man !
we gon na jump or jerk off ?
then we 'll earn it together . here , take mine .
you got ta earn trust .
i did . what 's the matter ? do n't trust me ?
so , who ... uh , who packed my chute ?
it 's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer . one last speedstar .
yeah , i noticed you limping . but do n't worry about it , brah . do n't worry at all . we 're not gon na land on land !
sure , it 's a blast , but listen , i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday --
pure adrenalin , right ? ! the ultimate rush . other guys snort for it , jab a vein for it -- all you got ta do is jump .
once .
ever done this before ?
'one shot stopping ' ... good , very good . i like you , johnny . i like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . i respect that . it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . here , hold it . check out the weight .
one shot stopping .
news , last night ... those guys , the ex-presidents ... they robbed my bank yesterday . and i was just there the day before , cashing a check . see ... look . assured trust ... same place .
how you figure ?
yeah , right , vision is highly over- rated .
the only way to win out here is to surrender . you have to feel what the wave is doing , accept its energy , get in sync . just feel it all moving in the blackness ... you do n't need to see .
a flaw i 'm working on .
i 've watched you once or twice . you surf like it 's some kind of street fight . you jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . always trying to win .
i know that part . tell me something i can use , here .
football 's a man-made game . you keep score with numbers . but in this , there 's no field , no rules , no opponent . just you and the wave .
yeah , but are you crazy enough ?
i got ta be fucking crazy .
no , bells beach , australia .
so what 's the biggest ? waimea ?
only make bets i ca n't afford to lose . only way to be 100 % committed .
do n't you gamble ?
come with tyler . she knows .
where ?
gon na be some people at my house tonight . maybe you can make it .
de nada .
thanks for stepping in .
no . so i was up the beach . i saw it going down . you did n't hesitate ... they never backed you up an inch . that 's rare in this world .
you always talk like this ? you 're not gon na start chanting or anything are you ?
they 're punks . nazis . their brains are wired wrong . they hurt surfing because they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . they just want to get radical . it 's mindless aggression . they 'll never get it , the spiritual side of it .
what 's their program ?
the one you decked is bunker wiess . the big one is his brother , warchild . the other two always hang . they think they 're some kinda death squad around here .
friends of yours , huh ?
not yet .
mmm . a lawyer , huh ? too bad . but at least you 're surfing now . so your life 's not over yet , right ?
two years of surgery . i missed my window . limped through law school instead .
and that 's why you never went pro ?
yeah , my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way .
something happened . you got nuked in the last quarter .
there 's nobody else here ...
well is there anyone else here that might have seen him ?
look , i do n't know anything about your dog , okay --
you sure he is n't out back ? you mind if i go take a look ?
no .
have you seen a little dog ? kind of a cockapoo lookin ' thing . about this big .
yeah ? what ?
take your hand off my shoulder right now .
three men dead . one of them a cop . how 's that sit in your gut , utah ?
caught my first tube this morning .
special agent utah , this is not some job flippin ' burgers at the drive-in . yes , the surfboard bothers me . yes , your approach to this case bothers me . and yes , you bother me . you two have produced squat in the last two weeks , during which time the ex- presidents have robbed two more banks ! ! do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me ?
the correct term is babes , sir . uh , this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech . otherwise penetration is not possible , sir . of the social infrastructure , i mean .
what ?
babes .
a little mushy ! you think the taxpayers would like it , utah , if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls ?
a little mushy .
surf conditions okay ?
fine .
how was the beach ?
not so far .
you 're a real blue-flame special , are n't you , utah ? i do n't know why they sent you to la . must be an asshole shortage .
zero distortion , sir .
that 's right . and we nailed over a thousand of them . we did it by crunching data . good crime-scene work , good lab work , good data-base analysis . nobody had to tackle a car once . you getting the signal , special agent ?
1322 last year in la county . up 26 percent from the year before .
this is us . bank robbery . and you 're in the bank-robbery capital of the world --
i take the skin off chicken .
all the food groups ? avoiding sugar ? caffeine ? i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness . we stay off hard liquor , cigarettes ...
sir ?
eating solid breakfasts , utah ?
yes , sir .
you know less than nothing . if you even knew that you knew nothing , at least that would be something , but you do n't .
what that ?
harp , let me tell you something . i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass , and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still have n't ?
yeah , sure . why not ? you two screw-ups deserve each other . that 's why i put you together in the first place . christ pappas , you 're as bad as he is ... talk about the blind leading the blind --
look , harp . do n't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk . let me ride him in .
supervising special agent , harp . now i want you to go work the drop car , okay , angelo ? okay ?
yeah , i get it . time to play let 's dick the old guys , huh , harp ?
that 's the point , is n't it ?
cole and munoz ? i been on this case for two years .
cole and munoz . i 'm uh ... letting them run with the ball for a while .
what ? now i 'm working the drop car ? who 's handling the scene here ?
they found the drop car up on mulholland . i want you two to go work it .
nooo ! !
kid , get outta the way ! !
angelo ! do n't fire !
figured you did .
i know where they 're going .
nothing .
nothing ?
you sure ? !
they took a left at the next light !
the hell are they ? !
that place up the street has meatball sandwiches . get me two .
angelo , it 's eleven thirty .
time for lunch .
look , we handle it ourselves , for right now , okay ? we cover the bank , whatever . you and me . that way if nothing happens , or more accurately , when nothing happens ... i do n't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are .
i say we do n't call it in . under no circumstance are we to call this in .
sure . no problem . i 'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious . shit , he 'll probably call out the national guard .
i say we call it in . get some backup . but you got ta do it . harp wo n't listen to me .
no way . not yet . come on .
they 're on their way to maui .
angelo ... i 'm right this time . we can still win this one .
last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man , which i always hate because it looks bad on the report .
wait , wait . then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit . load it in bodhi 's truck and take it to a public storage unit . you see ? summer 's almost over . they 're splitting . they 're gon na pick up a little traveling money tomorrow . the next day at the outside latest . i got a feeling .
yeah , or cashing a check .
cute . he was inside for about 20 minutes . the other guy , roach , waited in the truck . they were scoping it out , right ? !
did he rob it ?
bodhi , yeah . i 'm on him all day , right . he goes here , he goes there , he goes to tower records and buys come cds , he has lunch at patrick 's road house ... ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan .
this zen master surfer .
... so i started tailing him .
angelo , we got ta talk .
johnny ! uh , you , uh ... should call first , you know ? hey , where the hell were you all day ? you got ta at least call in or something . you okay ?
nice tattoo , dietz .
aw shit .
awright . get into position . i 'm rolling .
got it .
cole and munoz are going in the back door . babbit is backing me . so i want you at the side window by the hedge . you 're strictly backup , got it ?
i 'm ready to rock , angelo . where you want me ?
right here , partner .
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up ?
he 's pushing it through first thing . you better get some sleep tonight , it could be an interesting morning .
when did harp say they 'd have the warrant ?
remember , all bank robbers are losers , but not all losers are bank robbers .
... felony b and e , three months in juvey . better . felony assault . postgraduate work at chino . excellent . i 'm lovin ' it . what about the brother ? great ! another model citizen . these guys really fit the profile .
okay , dad .
look , if you 're gon na go leavin ' your piece and your shield in the car , you can damn well stay in sight . okay ?
thanks , buddy .
no , but there are four guys back there you might check out .
patience hotshot . patience . it 'll be subtle , if it 's here at all .
big zippo so far . how about you ?
no . but let 's do it , anyway . it 's gon na bug the shit out of harp .
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills , right ? and surfers are territorial . they stick mostly to certain breaks . if we can get some hair samples , and get a match to a certain beach , we 'd know which break the ex-presidents surf . you buyin ' this ?
guy 's the toxic avenger .
angelo , pay attention . there 's gon na be a test afterward . lab is showing traces of toxins . pcbs . heavy elements ... selenium , titanium and arsenic .
johnny , all i can say is we better come up with something real soon .
it sticks out , so i ca n't lock it . look , angelo , you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf ? this was your lame-o idea in the first place . you got ta back me up on this .
what , you could n't have just left the thing in your car ?
got it ...
i think you got ta hit them straight on !
it 's all balance , right ? and coordination . how hard can it be ?
angelo , this stuff is for little rubber people who do n't shave yet .
they 're like some kind of tribe . got their own language . you ca n't just walk up to these guys . you 've got to get out there . learn some moves . get into their head . pick up the speech .
why ca n't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned ? ask a few questions .
johnny , it 's the only way .
another month and we do n't see 'em again 'til next summer .
... four months . june to october . mmmm ... same the year before .
thanks for the tip . i needed this knowledge .
surfers use it on their boards . they rub sand into it for traction .
sex wax ? you 're not into kinky shit , are you angelo ?
the lab made three possible matches , this was one of 'em .
candle wax . car wax . mustache wax ? could be anything . guy 's waxing his mustache at the beach . gets sand in it . wipes it off with a shoe . shoe scuffs the counter .
shutup , you might learn somethin ' you 're not careful ... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over . there was a soil sample . non- specific mud traces of asphalt , oils , blah , blah ... sand and ... carnuba wax . so i became a wax expert . there 's 80 some uses for this stuff , something like five hundred products .
oh well he must be a surfer .
the fucking punks are surfers .
yeah . what 's your theory ?
yeah . that was thirty years ago anyway . l.a. 's changed a lot since then . the air got dirty and the sex got clean . so you want to nail the ex- presidents ? be a big hero ?
sorry .
you watch your fucking mouth ! mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here !
so you 're gon na coast to retirement , when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity .
forget about it , kid . they 're ghosts . let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it . see i 'm almost 55 ... so i must be senile , right ? they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public . drooling . it would look bad for the bureau , right ?
well , what 're your ideas on these guys ?
you through , mr. wizard ? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you 're at it . hell , it 's only 7:30. the night 's still young ... you can solve this case and start on another one .
the ex-presidents are the best i 've seen , kid .
surgical . look at them separate the dye packs . dick and ronny know their jobs .
reagan usually drives . stolen switch car , they leave it running at the curb , looks parked from a distance . when they run , they dump the vehicle and vanish . and i mean vanish .
smart . you burn time in the vault .
never go for the vault . they never get greedy .
they do n't go for the vault ?
yeah , they control the room well . stick strictly to the cash drawers .
good move .
welcome to sea world , kid .
punk . quarterback punk .
pappas . angelo pappas .
the shit they pull , huh ?
added to which indignity , i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner . some quarterback punk , johnny unitas or something .
fuck you , johnny utah . fuck you ! ! do n't you have a soul ? goddamn you to hell !
i work bank robbery . guys i 'm after are surfers . i needed you , at first , but not --
you tell me the fucking truth johnny ... did your parents really die in a car crash ? did they ? !
tyler , put the gun down .
jesus christ , johnny -- you 've been using me ! your jacket 's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing 's half out of the pocket ... oh god , it 's all part of some case , is n't it ?
but you look like you been in a train wreck , how 'd he just drive away ?
never saw him , was your basic hit and run .
so what 'd the other guy look like ?
you 're kneeling on my hand .
betadyne does n't hurt .
ouch .
no . i 'm sorry . i have to go . i 'll , uh ... i 'll call you later . i 'm sorry .
johnny ... what 's going on ? i do n't get it ... did i do something ?
i ... i got ta go .
warm them up .
those are cold .
you do n't have to .
i ... i do n't know . i ca n't describe what i 'm feeling .
well , usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration , like you 're doing this for a school project or something ... i do n't know , like something 's driving you . see , it 's gone . if i did n't know better i 'd say you looked almost happy .
what ?
look at you .
yeah . i just want to sit out here for a minute .
you had enough ?
come on . at least no one 's gon na see how bad you are .
i can barely do this in broad daylight .
swell 's here , johnny . bodhi always knows .
what 's goin ' on ?
i 've seen that kamikaze look , johnny . you 've got it . and bodhi can smell it a mile away . he 'll take you to the edge ... and past it . hey , bodhi .
what are you talking about ?
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies . i hope you 're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi 's moonies .
yeah , he thinks he 's evolved to a higher plane of existence , or something . maybe he has . you 've seen him surf ... that frenzy . it seems like anger . it 's not . it 's the energy of lovemaking . the sea is the woman in his life . she 's his only true lover .
sure , he 's `` the bodhisattva '' .
we went out for about five minutes ... which is four minutes longer than most of them . but you ca n't hold it against him , he 's ... different .
meaning you were expendable .
people are expendable to bodhi .
oh , oh . that sounds personal .
catch of the day .
who 's the girl ?
he rents it for the summer . bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . most a these guys ca n't keep a job . when the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride .
nice place .
sure .
stop here . do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it ?
tomorrow , 6 am . here . if you 're a minute late i 'm gone . and stud ... i did n't take you to raise . i can show you a few things but after that you 're on your own . that 'll be four fifty .
i came out here from ohio a month ago . never saw the ocean before . i did n't think it would effect me so much . like i 'm drawn to it , or something . i want to do what you do . it 's the truth .
wait , so i 'm a big hero to my folks , right ? but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals . and i had n't been living my own life . so i wanted something for myself . something that maybe did n't make any sense . you know what i mean ?
this gon na take long ?
no , no . see , all my life i 've done things for other people . in high school i played football because my old man expected me to . then my parents always figured i 'd go to law school , so i did . football scholarship . graduated phi beta kappa --
what is it ? you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing ? this is a line , right ?
well , i 'm just gon na go back out there till i catch on to it or break my neck .
i can see that . but forget it . stick to tennis , or whatever you 're good at . miniature golf . here , your number 's 37 .
i 'm serious .
gim me a break . one shrimp and fries to go ! anything to drink ?
i need you to teach me .
i mean , what do you want ? what are you doing hanging around here .
shrimp and fries .
what do you want ?
wait ! jesus christ ! you 're fucking crazy , you know that ? you go in there you 're gon na eat it on the rocks . here , follow me .
bye .
i 'm telling you so when you look back on this moment , you can think ... there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever ... when i could have easily helped him .
who cares !
my name 's johnny utah !
carefully , tough guy . very carefully .
hey ! uh , how do i get back in ?
yeah , you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it , a big strong stud like you should n't have any problem . right ? ! well you figured wrong , dork !
well , i saw you and --
something ... in the trees ...
billy ... what the hell 's wrong with you ?
what about the rest of hopper 's men ?
i do n't believe he did , sir . i could n't find a single track . just does n't make sense .
i ca n't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush .
strange , major . there was a firefight . shooting in all directions .
six others , u.s. issue jungle boots . they came in from the north , then followed the guerrillas .
what do you mean ?
major , looks like there were ten , maybe twelve guerrillas . looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper . then a different set of track , over there .
right behind you .
i 'll see you there .
you know you ca n't win this one .
guess i 've picked up some bad habits from you , dutch . now do n't argue with me , you know i 'm right . get to that chopper and hold it for us . we 'll be along .
this is n't your style , dillon .
no way , dutch . i 'm going . you get these people and get the hell out of here .
now what , dutch . you going to send your mystery guest an invitation ?
he 'll be looking for the trip wires . if we 're lucky , he wo n't see this .
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles , at most ! we 're almost home . but the chopper wo n't wait .
we 're not going .
what are you talking about ? we 'll be out of here in ten minutes .
we 're going to need everyone .
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?
no more games .
you 're wastin ' your time .
bullshit . you 're just like the rest of us .
i can accept that , it comes with the job .
expendable assets , dillon . seems langley is never around when you need them .
we 're still too far in , they wo n't risk coming in for us .
the wound all fused , cauterized ... what the hell did this ?
blain ... ... just like the others ... no powder burns , no shrapnel .
we take her and she 'll give away our position , every chance she gets . no prisoners , dillon .
she 's too valuable . she 's got to know their whole network . the whole set up . we take her with us .
we 've been lookin ' for this place for months . the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down . hopper was sent in to get my men . he was just doing his job . when he disappeared i had to clean this up , i had to stop there bastards . we were so close , we could n't quit . we could n't sleep through this one . i needed you , dutch , ca n't you see that ?
what story did you give to davis ?
because i told you , you 're the best . i knew you could do it but i could n't get you in here without a cover story .
why us ?
that 's right , i set you up . you 're a veteran at this , dutch , i had to .
it was all bullshit . all of it . from the start ... you set us up , got us in here to do your dirty work .
well somebody sent them .
jesus ... this is inhuman . uh ... i was n't told of any operations in this area . they should n't have been here .
i knew this man . green berets , out of fort bragg . what the hell were they doing in here ? you got any answers for this , dillon ?
probably another rebel patrol . they operate in here all the time .
mean anything to you ?
they 're getting better equipped every day .
billy 's on it . heat seeker . pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys .
you never were all that smart ... let 's go ! ! !
you do n't know how much i missed this , dutch ! ! ! once you get this in your blood , you never get it out ! ! !
this gets better by the minute .
no such thing , old buddy . it 's a one way ticket . once we cross that border , we 're on our own .
who 's our back-up on this ?
our rendezvous points and radio freqs . are indicated and fixed . awacs contact on four hour intervals .
go on .
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . they 're about to get squeezed . we ca n't let that happen . i needed someone who could get the job done , quick and quiet ... no screw-ups . i needed the best . the best . so , i pulled a few strings at the state department ... and here we are .
was n't my style . we 're a rescue unit , not assassins . this must be good . big shot from the cia , leaves his desk to come back to the bush . what 's so important ?
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya .
like the old days , dillon .
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something . blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat . beautiful .
you never did know when to quit .
no way , old buddy .
you 've been pushing too many pencils , dillon . had enough ?
we both got scores to settle .
... right , i got a score to settle for the bro ...
take a position over there . i 'll work around towards you . when i flush him , you nail him ...
those eyes ... disappeared . but i know one thing , major ... ... i drew down and fired right at it . capped-off two hundred rounds and then the mini-gun ; the full pack . nothin ' ... nothin ' on this earth could have lived ... not at that range .
what , sergeant ?
do n't know , only saw one of 'em . camouflaged . he was there ... ... those fucking eyes ...
anytime .
thanks .
the best friend i ever had .
i 'm sorry , bull . it 's never easy . he was a good soldier .
thank you , sergeant .
we 've got most of the flares , frags . and two claymores just outside . nothin 's comin ' close to here without trippin ' on somethin ' .
i 'll take him .
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back . we 'll bury him in the morning .
i saw it .
you saw what ?
ca n't say , major ... been squirrely all mornin ' ... fuckin ' weird ... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good ... smells things that ai n't there .
what 's got billy so spooked ?
we found 'em both , dead . and the gear from the chopper . if they 're central american , i 'm a fuckin ' chinaman . by the looks of 'em , i 'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia . another thing , major , we were lucky ... couple of those guys we waxed are russians , military advisors by the look of it . something big was about to happen here .
any sign of the hostages ?
someone else will be going in with you .
what 's that , general ?
you lift off in three hours . there 's one other thing .
we figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . after that , there 's not much hope . we want a rescue operation mounted tonight . that does n't give you much time .
what have you got in mind , general .
that 's the problem . apparently they strayed off course . we 're certain they 've been captured by the guerrillas .
that 's over the border , general .
it 's been a long time , general .
you 're looking well , dutch .
why did n't he try to kill one of us last night ?
he knows our defenses .
how could anyone get through this , carry blain out , right under our noses without leavin ' a trace ?
there 's no sign of it .
where the hell is his body ?
i think it 's hawkins .
what in god 's name ... ?
i ca n't tell .
hawkins ?
major , you 'd better take a look at this .
same business , guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment ...
what 's he got ?
i do n't think that was any ordinary army taxi ...
mmmnnn ... ?
there 's something else , major ...
took 'em out with a heat seeker .
they never are , dear .
he 's not really my uncle .
your uncle will like this .
philip ! we 'll need shoes !
i dunno . do thigh high , leather boots go with a cocktail dress ?
you 'll want a cocktail dress then . turn . you have a beautiful figure . a little too out in the open but simply lovely . size six ? do you need shoes ?
well ... i might be going out to dinner .
no wonder . for starts , you should know that hot pants are < u > horrid < /u > , even when you do have the legs to carry them off . what are your plans while you 're in town ?
georgia .
i do . i take it all very personally . very nice meeting you , vivian .
do what you have to do . i do n't take it personally .
i do n't think so . you should know we 're going to fight you with every resource we have .
we can reach an understanding on this .
but i do know . i also know your lines of credit are over-extended . if i do n't buy your company , someone else will ... ah , the escargot .
there 's no way you could know that .
you 're not getting any navy contracts .
we 're on the verge of closing a large navy contract . double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares . we would give you a promissory note ...
twenty-five percent .
mr. harris , we know you 've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock . we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share .
i 'd like to find out . you do n't know anything about me either . that 's why people have lunch .
you do n't know anything about me .
i see . well . maybe that means you 'd have lunch with me sometime then .
it 's ... it 's not like that .
hope to be ?
no .
hey , big guy , you getting tired , yet ? i am . this is vivian . you two been together long ? you and edward ?
thunder 's a horse . come on .
please , we hardly know each other .
let 's not talk about it , it 's too depressing . come on , i 'll show you thunder .
huh ? oh ... yeah . s'okay ? uhm ... how 're ... business things going .
i like your hat .
who indeed ...
who are you going after next , sir ?
mr. kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker . it 's finished . you 've won .
what ?
congratulations , sir .
i talked to some developers about the land .
you what ?
the real estate possibilities are endless . most of the yard we 'll just level . i talked to a couple of developers , under the table , of course , and they said --
not with those smokestacks it 's not .
storage , i think .
what 's that long building over there ?
you 're very right . i think the best thing we could all do is go home .
you 'd be initiating a financial battle you 'd ultimately lose , mr. harris .
this time i imagine you would , yes . hmm ... with all this in mind , mr. kross , i ca n't logically make a formal bid on your company , can i ?
quiet . would i get the loans ?
i suppose you 'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently do n't seem aware of , would n't you ? the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours , you 'd certainly find out about that .
i ... i do n't know . there ... there was n't time ...
how ?
i ... i would take advantage of it .
if you had a ... reprieve , what would do ?
yes .
stop . for just a moment . mr. kross , i 'd like to ask you a few questions < u > before < /u > you sign . you realize that you 're a target . if you were n't mine , you 'd be someone elses , correct ?
you 're making the right decision , sir .
of course , yes . after the < u > expected < /u > filing period is over , i 'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid .
< u > expected < /u > ... offer .
yes . i 'm here to tell you that i 've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer .
not bad for a man who has n't slept in four nights . i 'll get used to it .
how are you , mr. kross .
mr. harris .
it is < u > not < /u > your company . it 's a public company . and i < u > am < /u > going to acquire it . either i buy from the other stock holders , or i buy from you .
i do n't question the legality of what you do . it 's your morality that makes me sick . i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you .
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal .
i know all about you , mr. harris . when you buy companies , they have a way of disappearing . even the pension funds are stripped clean . the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces , widows were left without their retirement checks .
no . what i have is a lot of money .
you 've got a lot of nerve .
mr. kross , i 'm not here to sell you my stock . on the contrary , i 'm here to buy yours .
to get me in a mood to sell -- double what i paid . but your company does n't have enough capital right now to buy anything .
what would it take to buy our stock back ? name your price .
it 's not your fault . you 're right . kit 's right . but i want the fairy tale .
vivian ...
i did n't think so .
i do . i do want to . that 's why i 'm leaving . that 's what you given me , see ? i know what i want now . i want a guy like you for real . not because you buy me things and give me money . the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand . you gon na give me that ?
stay with me tonight . not because you 're being paid to . stay with me because you want to .
aw , do n't ... no ...
i 'm leaving . do n't ya see ? if i stay with you like you want me to , there 'll always be some guy , your friends eve , treatin ' me like that ... thinkin ' they 're allowed to . what are you gon na do , fight 'm all ? no . i 'll take my money now , please .
you 're packing .
it felt good .
it was good .
i got tired of hating my father .
it was a business decision .
right . you 're quite the sir galahad today , are n't ya ' ? i heard what you did with kross .
not all men hit . and no one is going to hit you anymore .
why do guys always know how to hit a woman ? right across the cheek , wham , so it feels like your eye is gon na explode . what do they do , take you all aside in high school and show you how ? it pisses me off !
it 's what i do for a living . it 's how i make money .
it 's all just business to you . him . me . your life . everything 's business .
yes . the man made a business decision .
business .
it 's not your concern . it 's ... business , that 's all .
right .
vivian , i want you to listen to me . the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son 's future , if he cooperated .
last time i saw him he was this strong guy . now he 's beaten . and you < u > liked him < /u > .
what do you mean ?
what did you do to him ?
you just did .
i 've never treated you like a whore .
i know . hey , do n't mind me . i 'm being stupid . i 'll think about it , okay ? it 's a real good offer for a whore .
vivian , life 's not a fairy tale .
when i was a little girl , my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad , which was pretty often . i 'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen . then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up . rescue me from the tower , and then we 'd ride off ... but never , ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say , `` come on baby , i 'll put you up in a great condo . ''
vivian , i 've thought about this a lot . this is the best solution .
i 'm sorry . that 's very sweet , edward , and i know you mean it ...
it would n't be like that . i want to get you off the street . you 'll have a different kind of life . what 's wrong with that ?
what else ? you gon na leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town ?
i have to go to new york tomorrow .
yeah , you 've been pretty tough to take .
one more night and you 're finally rid of me .
yes . i 've never enjoyed it more . thank you .
did you ?
i know . i 'm glad .
i more than liked it .
if you 'd gone on about how much you liked it , i 'm not sure i 'd have believed you .
vivian , do n't be afraid of what you do n't know . that 's the fun of it .
but do n't they have it in english ?
i 'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you . but you 'll be surprised how much you understand . the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words .
if it 's in italian , how will i know what they 're saying ?
what happened to him ?
you mean , besides elvis ? i 'm a human being . sure . once . first time i ever ran away from home , i got as far as atlanta . i met this boy . he 'd been with his parents on their way to chicago . they stopped at a gas station . he went to the john . when he came back they 'd split . we sorta started looking out for each other . aw , he was sweet . and boy , was he good looking , y'know , dark hair and eyes . the chicken hawks were on him all the time . he hated that . sometimes we 'd find a safe place to crash nights and we 'd curl up together and we 'd talk about all these crazy things . the two of us getting married someday . having kids . stupid stuff .
vivian . i 'm paying you to be you . be you . have you ? ever been in love with anyone ?
sorry . you 're not paying me to ask you question like that .
i 'm glad you like it . now be quiet , i 've really got to read these .
i 've never been on a plane before .
the opera .
huh ?
to meet some friends . rudolpho , a poet ... benoit , a landlord ... mimi , a flower maker ...
where are you taking me ! ?
you do n't want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine , do you ? i do n't .
i 'll guard them and you with my life .
what if someone tries to steal it ?
you wo n't .
what if i lose it ?
shush . of course you can .
edward , i ca n't .
i do n't want you to get too excited ... these are on loan ... however ...
what 's that ?
hmm ... let 's see ... no , there 's something missing .
do i look okay ?
i really am sorry .
i 'm not hurt . it does n't hurt you when somebody pisses on you , it just pissed you off .
vivian ... i 'm sorry . i was n't prepared for questions about us . it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did . i should have known that it would hurt you .
i 'll call you a cab . if you want the clothes , pack them up .
fuck off .
fine . i 'm only here a couple of more days and i 'm not going to spend them fighting with you .
pay me ! before i pick up this chair and smash your face in .
vivian ...
well , it 's true . just pay me what you owe me and i 'm gone .
your goddamned friend , he thinks the only reason i 'm with you is for the money .
can we talk about this ? can you just try to calm down ?
i want my fucking money . i 'm getting out of here . i do n't want anything more to do with you .
what was i supposed to do ? i told the truth . why should the truth upset you ? it 's not as if you 're from a convent .
stuckey ! he wants an `` appointment '' with me after you leave . you my pimp now or did he think that up on his own ?
would you please calm down . tell me what happened .
i 've been with stinking old men who 've made me want to puke but i 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
clean the slut up , take her out , huh ? ! what are you trying to prove ! ? i 'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends !
vivian , what the --
you asshole ! i ca n't believe what a -- !
ready to stomp sod ?
i thought i was the pro . these women make me feel like an amateur .
i 'm sure that 's true for some of them .
edward , these women here , i do n't think any of 'm like the guys they 're with . they 're just into it for the money .
shall we mingle ?
you could freeze ice on his wife 's ass . she anything like your ex ?
he 's good at what he does .
real genuine guy .
you did .
i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard .
what id we run into someone i know ?
i think it 's exciting .
you 're really pushing it , bringing me here .
he died a long time ago .
you still mad at 'm ?
not much to tell . i went to public school . went to university on scholarship . went to work for an investment firm . in eight years i owned it . my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after . i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces . one of the pieces was him .
keep talkin ' . i like hearin ' .
easier than learning how to be poor . my father 's family was wealthy . when i was young there were cars and houses , private schools , nannies . but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman . and he took his money with him .
seems like it . i guess it 's easy to get used to , huh ?
no .
you always been rich ?
dinner can wait .
what about dinner ?
please .
wait till you see what i have on underneath .
thank you . i would . nice .
i thought maybe you 'd like dinner .
come with me ?
good .
okay .
vivian , you belong wherever you are . i do n't care how you were dressed , they were the ones who were wrong , not you .
i had a little problem in one store . i was n't dressed right . i do n't know what to say . i do n't belong there . maybe i 'll just go back to bridget . she was cool .
was someone rude to you ?
well , you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you ? it works .
why not ?
i was n't as much fun as i thought it was going to be .
i still do n't understand why you only bought one dress .
uh-uh . no work .
i have work to do .
yeah , it 's this box , it has pictures , sound . you do n't have to use your brain at all .
television ?
know what we 're gon na do in a little while then ? we 're gon na call domino 's and have 'm deliver a bigass pizza . we 're gon na eat it in bed . we 're gon na veg ' out and watch television .
we 're the exactly the same ! kit keeps telling me do n't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that 's why no kissing -- it 's too personal . the key is like you 're saying , stay numb , do n't get involved -- when i 'm with a guy , i 'm a robot , i just do it . except with you . at your price i give my all ...
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant . it 's business . there 's no emotion involved in business ... if you want to survive .
you liked the guy , though .
upset . no . i never get upset about business .
you 're upset , huh ?
some game . screwin ' some poor slob out of his retirement .
and that 's the way the game is played .
you 're forgiven .
i 'm sorry .
oooh !
i thought i told you not to answer the phone .
hello ?
thank you < u > very much < /u > .
... all right . i 'll meet you in the lobby . but only cause you 're paying me to .
i think you 'll approve .
any good ?
the rex .
go by yourself then . where you taking me anyway ?
this is n't a date .
no , i do n't `` got it '' . even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when they 're taking you on a date .
let 's hope so . you 'll get some more clothes tomorrow . i 'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp . got it ?
it 's very tasteful . i think you 'll especially like the zipper in the crotch . i 'm -- joking .
just one ? christ ... i hope it 's appropriate .
i got a dress , yeah .
did you buy some clothes ?
tsk , believe me , this will be the last time .
never answer the phone . ever .
three thousand for five days . and vivian , i will let you go .
look butthead , i 'll treat you so nice you 'll never want to let me go , okay ?
i 'm not just talking about sex .
holy shit .
done .
three .
all right , two thousand .
but you want days too .
vivian , may i point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500 .
four thousand .
five full nights ... days too ?
of course . how much ?
it 'd cost you .
i 'm in town until saturday .
what ?
all right . how much for the week ?
do n't drown .
i fucked the debate team in high school . tsk . i had a grampa . he liked ties on sundays . you mind if i take a swim in your bathtub before i hit it ?
where 'd you learn to do this ?
there , see ? now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot .
not ... quite .
sorta like stealing cars and selling 'm for parts , huh ?
assets are anything of value a company owns . sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole . by selling them off , i make a profit .
c'mon , i might buy a company some day .
vivian --
what are assets ?
by breaking up a company 's assets --
what ? why ?
i sell them .
so what a ya do with the companies once you buy 'm ?
... dollars ?
the one i 'm buying this week will cost around 150 million .
no shit . they expensive ?
i buy companies .
`` occupational hazard '' .
no ? why 's that ?
i like guys if that 's what you 're asking . not that i trust 'm .
do you ever ... enjoy it ?
i 'd say you give a good dollar value .
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks .
mmm , i could tell .
oooh , baby , you were the best . i was beside myself .
i took the couch . i had some work to do . about last night ...
where 'd you go ?
occupational hazard ?
yeah . too good . i forgot where i was .
did you sleep well ?
no hurry . would you like some breakfast ?
you did n't wake me . i 'll be out of here in a minute .
good morning .
if i want you to turn me on i 'll pay < u > you < /u > three hundred . just lay back and let me drive .
what do you like ?
yes ...
just a romantic , that 's you .
you really are a very beautiful girl .
vivian ... the meter 's running ... cooperate .
jesus , you act like you 're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club .
because they bring out the flavor of the champagne .
why ?
try a strawberry .
oooh , thank god .
it 's a very good year .
they should be . they 're both good at it .
where are they ? shopping together ?
tsk . excuse me , i did n't think he had change for a hundred .
i think he wanted you to tip him .
i 've known a lot of everybody .
sounds like you 've known a lot of lawyers .
i dunno ... you have that sharp , useless look .
and why do you say that ?
let me guess , you 're a ... lawyer .
uh-huh .
right . so ! in town on business ?
let 's talk some more first .
fair enough .
well , the meter 's running , it 's your money . speaking of which , cash 'll do . in advance .
always .
do you plan everything ?
want to know something ? i do n't quite know . i had n't planned this .
-- and a bowl of strawberries . thank you .
can i have some chips ?
send up a bottle of crystal champagne .
diet coke .
room service . what do you drink ?
exactly .
off the boulevard .
every place has hookers , but if this hotel has hookers , they do n't look like they 're ...
you mean they do n't have hookers .
you may feel more comfortable . this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour .
why ?
my raincoat 's in the back . put it on .
then let 's go . it 's worth 300 just so i do n't have to drive .
better believe it .
you know how to drive a stick ?
what ?
get in . this side .
edward ... you got it !
edward . my name is edward .
what 's your name , lover .
fine .
three hundred .
you could n't afford it .
vivian , how much to put up with me for the entire night ?
no , but it 's getting there .
neither do i. a hundred bucks an hour though . that 's pretty stiff .
i never joke about money .
you 're joking .
for an hour .
for the whole night ?
company would cost you ... a hundred dollars .
what do you charge for company , vivian ?
you do n't know habits , you think this is ugly .
ugly habit , biting your nails .
sorry . if i did , i did n't mean to .
if you 're making fun of me , i do n't like it .
very good . you ought to have that printed up on your business card .
tell me about it . l.a. is suffering from a wacko epidemic . and who knows where half the guys i pick up have been . i mean , i use condoms . always . and i get checked out once a month at the free clinic . not only am i better in the sack than an amateur , i 'm probably safer .
must be dangerous . hooking .
day jobs , yeah . i 've tried them . turn right .
so do day jobs .
it pays .
you like being a hooker , vivian ?
what do you want it to be ? vivian , my name 's vivian .
what 's your name ?
yeah , i peed in the fountain there once . give me a break .
regent beverly wilshire . i bet you know it .
okay , what < u > ho < /u > tel ?
< u > ho < /u > tel .
what motel you staying at ?
new york .
you 're not from l.a. , huh ?
very good . you 're obviously mechanical .
if you can figure it out , be my guest .
mind if i turn on some heat ?
not exactly .
stolen ?
no .
nice car . yours ?
sit-and-spin . alright ... why not ?
sit ... and spin .
why do n't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ?
the price just went up to ten .
that 's ridiculous .
sure . for five bucks .
good . can you tell me how to get to beverly hills ?
actually , i 'm a movie star out for a walk .
no , you look like a hooker .
great . what do i look like a tourguide ?
yes .
what ? you gon na tell me you 're lost ?
uh , no . how do i get to beverly hills ?
you looking ' for some company ?
what 's that ?
hey sugar , you lookin ' for a date ?
afternoon .
good afternoon , mr. harris .
thank you .
mr. harris , a guest of yours , is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly . the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge .
the young lady staying in your room ?
my what ?
i have a message for you from your `` niece '' , sir .
of course , yes . if you 'll excuse me just a moment --
barnard thomas , manager of the hotel .
yes .
all this because of that whore !
and i do n't like what we 've become . i 'll cover any losses you have on this one . now get out , you asshole !
edward , we 've been together ten years .
i think i broke my hand . you 're fired .
you broke my nose .
have a good day , gentlemen .
what ! ?
have you lost your mind ?
i suppose you 'd use them as collateral on new loans , would n't you ?
oh , my god ... edward , no !
let him answer .
i do n't think there 's any sense in --
we 'll be there . listen , if he 's really caving in , we 'll go from there down to the office . i want him to commit his stock to us this morning .
give me twenty minutes .
he would n't say . edward ... i think we got him . his nuts are on the block and < u > we got him < /u > . you there ?
why ?
i had to call . i jus got off the phone with james kross . get this . he wants to see you . today .
i 'm up .
did i wake you ?
goodbye , bill .
promise me you 'll read those contracts by then .
bill ? stop panicking . kross is n't going anywhere and i do n't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down . i 'll be in the office tomorrow .
this is no time to disappear . we 're in too far .
christ , bill , she 's not a spy , she 's a hooker . i picked her up off hollywood boulevard .
industrial espionage is not ridiculous . edward , how do you know she has n't attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information ?
you 're being ridiculous .
so now they 're best friends ? edward , this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company we 're trying to buy . it 's too convenient .
she met him at dinner last night ... i like this tie .
hear me out . i 've known you a long time . i see a difference in you this week . like that tie . i 'm suddenly wondering if this girl 's not the difference . especially when i see her talking with david kross .
why do you want to know ?
sales , really ? that 's great . what does she sell ?
vivian 's in sales .
doing what ?
yes ...
and you just happened to run into her . great . what 's she do ? she work ?
the night i left your house , i was lost . i was looking for directions .
come on , you can tell me . i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this .
we just did .
fill me in on this . how 'd you and vivian meet ?
bill stuckey , vivian . my wife , elizabeth .
bill , i 'd like you to meet vivian .
and some of it 's mine . edward , his jugular 's exposed .
come on , bill , do n't talk to me about how much money 's involved . it 's my money .
excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week ? first , you go soft on the pension funds . now , you 're giving him the chance to get away ? as of two minutes ago , you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
do it .
but , edward ...
i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now .
we 're letting them slide ?
put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise .
our contract guys are working on the kross pension funds . there 's another forty million there . we can bleed 'm dry .
someone 's loaning it to him . get on it right away .
goddamit ! where is he getting the money to fight ?
no one you know .
eight o'clock . kross is bringing his son . very bright kid , watch yourself with him . who 's this girl you 're taking ?
what time 's diner tonight ?
we do n't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . besides ... you 've already impressed everyone you need to , have n't you ?
what ! ?
i know a lot of nice girls .
i 'm here .
edward , did you hear me ?
i 'll bring it back .
oh , god , what ?
bill , we 're businessmen , not the damn mafia . i 'll see you in the office . by the way , about your car ...
you should n't go alone . he might claim that you tried to black mail him .
i 'll see him alone . everyone knows you 're my muscle . we 'll make it social . tell kross i 'll meet him for dinner . tonight if you can arrange it .
edward , if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal .
i want to .
yes ! and you do n't even know where you 're going !
love this car ! is it new ?
no .
cynthia 's not coming ?
really ? some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do ? no , thank you . i just got off the phone with one .
listen , there 're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you ...
apologize to elizabeth for me .

yeah , well , i check out today .
mr. harris does n't check out until tomorrow .
look i just wanted to say goodbye .
miss vivian .
hi , barney !
i 'd send them up , but sadly , i do n't trust the young lady to find you on her own .
me ?
barnard thomas here . miss vivian , i wonder if you might come down to the front desk . there 's someone here to see you .
professionally ?
miss vivian ... there 's a salon here in the hotel . instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners , why do n't you just have your hair done instead ?
maybe i 'll just order a burger , barney , that way i can eat with my hands .
miss vivian --
steak spoon !
then you would use your --
i like steak .
then you use your < u > soup spoon < /u > .
but what if they serve soup ?
they will serve salad .
what if they serve soup ?
actually , some of the richest people i know have the worst manners . of course , mr. harris , being of old money , knows his way around a table . all right now , pay attention please . salad fork .
hmmm ... i vonder vich .
either you 're european or badly brought up .
but i always eat like this .
in fifteen minutes i can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen . first , as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand .
okay . thanks , barney . you 're the best .
you 'll like it fine .
will i like it ?
i think you 'll find it normal enough .
yeah , mine too . is it like , y'know , normal ?
it 's a bit beyond my ... range , shall we say .
edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner . the rex . ever been there ?
what is it , miss vivian ?
they were real nice to me there . they treated me , y'know ... nice . thanks , barney .
that 's all right . i 'm sure they 're quite lovely .
i did n't want to get it messed . i got shoes too . wan na see ?
i rather hoped you 'd be wearing it .
i got a dress .
of course . naturally when mr. harris leaves , i wo n't see you in this hotel again .
niece ?
miss vivian ... things that go on in other hotels do n't happen at the regent beverly wilshire .
vivian .
what 's your name ?
i ... edward ...
and who is that ?
i 'm -- i 'm with a friend .
you 're a guest here ?
i 'm just going to my room .
i was in here yesterday .
no , i 'm sorry , i do n't .
do you remember me ?
yes ?
'scume me .
would you like to try it on ?
i do n't think we have anything for you here . you 're obviously in the wrong place .
i 'm going to spend < u > money < /u > .
excuse me ?
what is with you ?
it 's very expensive .
i did n't ask if it would fit . i asked how much it was .
i do n't think it would fit you .
you have beautiful things . how much is this ?
yes ...
yes . something ... conservative .
are you looking for something in particular ?
i 'm just looking , thanks .
may i help you ?
do n't worry . i 'll pay for it . what a you charge ? huh ? twenty , thirty , fifty bucks , < u > maybe < /u > ? are you a fifty dollar whore ?
get out !
aw , come on , bill . it 's just business .
i bet . a lousy whore and you 're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal .
i think it 's great .
do you want to know what he did ? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did ? he handed the whole thing back to kross ! on a silver platter . for no reason ! what was he thinking , i mean , what was going through his goddam head ? why ? what was all that benevolent crap ? what are we going to become , a philanthropic foundation ? i 'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities .
i just might do that .
yeah . sure . why not . call me at the regent beverly wilshire .
it 's okay . edward told me . your secret 's safe with me .
what ?
all this must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard .
yeah . thanks .
having a good time , vivian ?
you survived the fire swamp . you must be very brave ... ... but nobody withstands the machine . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 69 .
you do n't believe me ?
so it 's to be torture .
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they 're broken .
then why bother curing me ?
till they kill you . yeah .
then i 'm here till i die ?
do n't even think -- -- do n't even think about trying to escape . the chains are far too thick . and do n't dream of being rescued either . the only way in is secret . and only the prince , the count , and i know how to get in and out .
then why is there fear behind your eyes ?
i killed him myself .
i do not marry tonight .
brides often are , i 'm told .
should i be ?
you do n't seem excited , my little muffin .
why not ? you ca n't hurt me . westley and i are joined by the bonds of love . and you can not track that . not with a thousand bloodhounds . and you can not break it . not with a thousand swords . and when i say you are a coward , that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth .
i-would-not-say-such things-if- iwere-you-
yes , i am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .
you 're a silly girl .
you never sent the ships . do n't bother lying . it does n't matter . westley will come for me anyway .
yes . yes , of course . naturally , not those four .
every ship but the four you sent .
every ship but your four fastest , you mean .
ah ! my dulcet darling . tonight we marry . tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon .
of course .
he will come for me .
i suggest a deal . you write four copies of a letter . i 'll send my four fastest ships . one in each direction . the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year . we 'll run up the white flag and deliver your message . if westley wants you , bless you both . if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide . are we agreed ?
my westley will always come for me .
i swear it will be done .
he is a sailor on the pirate ship `` revenge . '' promise to return him to his ship .
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .
if we surrender , and i return with you , will you promise not to hurt this man ?
oh , my sweet westley ; what have i done ?
... as ... you ... wish ...
you mocked me once , never do it again -- i died that day !
faithfulness he talked of , madam . your enduring faithfulness . now , tell me truly . when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ?
and what am i ?
i asked him what was so important for him . `` true love , '' he replied . and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness . i can only assume he meant you . you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are .
he died well , that should please you . no bribe attempts or blubbering . he simply said , `` please . please , i need to live . '' it was the `` please '' that caught my memory . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 53 .
nothing you can say will upset me .
does it bother you to hear ?
life is pain , highness . anyone who says differently is selling something . i remember this farm boy of yours , i think . this would be , what , five years ago ?
you mock my pain !
i ca n't afford to make exceptions . once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft , people begin to disobey you , and then it 's nothing but work , work , work , all the time .
on the high seas , your ship attacked , and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners .
hardly complimentary , your highness . why loose your venom on me ?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces .
with pride . what can i do for you ?
you 're the dread pirate roberts ; admit it .
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything .
rest , highness .
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream .
`` are not capable of love '' is what you mean .
he knows i do not love him .
you admit to me you do not love your fiance ?
i never said he was my dearest love . and yes , he will save me . that i know .
you think your dearest love will save you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 50 .
i was giving you a chance . no matter where you take me ... there 's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck . he could track a falcon on a cloudy day . he can find you
and what is that worth , the promise of a woman ? you 're very funny , highness .
if you 'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you 'll get it , i promise you ...
catch your breath .
they were both poisoned . i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .
i am no one to be trifled with , that is all you ever need know .
who are you ?
then you 're not married -- if you did n't say it , you did n't do it -- would n't you agree , your highness ?
well , no , we sort of skipped that part .
did you say , `` i do '' ?
but it did . i was there . this old man said , `` man and wife . ''
it never happened . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 117 .
what ?
it never happened .
i got married . i did n't want to . it all happened so fast .
what hideous sin have you committed lately ?
oh , westley , will you ever forgive me ?
gently ! !
at a time like this that 's all you can think to say ? `` gently ? ''
gently .
oh , westley , darling . westley , why wo n't you hold me ?
now , was that so terrible ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 64 .
we did it .
rodents of unusual size ? i do n't think they exist ...
westley , what about the r.o.u.s . 's ?
i mean , what are the three terrors of the fire swamp ? one , the flame spurts . no problem . there 's a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that . two , the lightning sand . but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too .
no . no . we have already succeeded .
we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here .
what ? -- go on --
finally , roberts decided something . he said , `` all right , westley , i 've never had a valet . you can try it for tonight . i 'll most likely kill you in the morning . '' three years he said that . `` good night , westley . good work . sleep well . i 'll most likely kill you in the morning . '' it was a fine time for me . i was learning to fence , to fight , anything anyone would teach me . and roberts and i eventually became friends . and then it happened .
i myself am often surprised at life 's little quirks . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 59 .
but how is that possible , since he 's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago ?
this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts ' ship `` revenge '' is anchored at the far end . and i , as you know , am roberts .
you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 58 .
singed a bit , were you ?
nonsense -- you 're only saying that because no one ever has . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 57 .
we 'll never survive .
there will never be a need .
i will never doubt again .
death can not stop true love . all it can do is delay it for a while .
well ... you were dead .
i told you , `` i would always come for you . '' why did n't you wait for me ?
move ? you 're alive . if you want , i can fly .
can you move at all ?
this is true love . you think this happens every day ?
but how can you be sure ?
hear this now : i will come for you .
but what if something happens to you ?
of course you will .
i fear i 'll never see you again .
as you wish .
farm boy . fill these with water -- -- please .
as you wish .
farm boy . polish my horse 's saddle . i want to see my face shining in it by morning .
well ... ... you see , you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
why should that make such a difference ?
well , i have n't fought just one person for so long . i 've been specializing in groups . battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .
why is that , do you think ?
why do you wear a mask ? were you burned by acid , or something like that ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 39 .
and a good thing too .
you 're quick .
i just want you to feel you 're doing well . i hate for people to die embarrassed .
look are you just fiddling around with me or what ?
it 's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest . i do n't even exercise . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 38 .
frankly , i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting .
i could kill you now .
you mean , you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword , and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ?
we face each other as god intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .
i believe you -- so what happens now ?
i did that on purpose . i do n't have to miss .
oh , good , my way . thank you , vizzini . which way is my way ?
finish him , finish him . your way .
what do i do ?
give her to me . catch up with us quickly .
i 'm waiting !
you be careful . -- people in masks can not be trusted .
do n't say that , vizzini . please .
-- i do not accept excuses . i 'm just going to have to find myself a new giant , that 's all .
well , i 'm carrying three people . and he 's got only himself .
you were supposed to be this colossus . you were this great , legendary thing . and yet he gains .
i thought i was going faster .
faster !
veer left . left . left !
i only dog paddle .
anybody want a peanut ?
no more rhymes now , i mean it .
am i going mad or did the word `` think '' escape your lips ? you were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass .
i just do n't think it 's right , killing an innocent girl .
i 've hired you to help me start a war . that 's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition .
you never said anything about killing anyone .
once the horse reaches the castle , the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love . when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier , his suspicions will be totally confirmed .
the country across the sea . the sworn enemy of florin . go !
who 's guilder ?
it 's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder .
i 'll be right back .
he 's getting away from me , fezzik . please . fezzik !
i hope we win ...
what ?
inigo .
right , right , sorry .
do n't pester him , he 's had a hard day .
at miracle max 's . it fit so nice , he said i could keep it .
where did you get that ?
will this do ?
over the albino , i think .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had ?
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back .
you 've been mostly dead all day .
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works ?
tilt his head back . open his mouth .
we ca n't wait -- the wedding 's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand .
has it been fifteen minutes ?
what 's the difference ? we 've got him . help me here . we 'll have to force feed him .
inigo -- there 's more than thirty --
i just hope it 's enough to buy a miracle , that 's all . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 91 .
i have a little .
have you any money ?
the body ?
well , we montoyas have never taken defeat easily . come along , fezzik . bring the body .
everybody ... move ! !
-- fezzik , please --
his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering ? excuse me --
the man in black ?
do n't bother me with trifles ; after twenty years , at last , my father 's soul will be at peace .
but you do n't know where he is .
to find the man in black , obviously .
-- where ?
-- look , he bested you with strength , your greatness . he bested me with steel . he must have outthought vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle 's onslaught any day . let 's go --
-- what ? --
no -- not vizzini -- i need the man in black --
that leaves twenty for me . at my best , i could never defeat that many . i need vizzini to plan . i have no gift for strategy . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 82 .
i do n't think more than ten .
how many could you handle ?
he 's with the prince in the castle . but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .
yeah ?
perhaps not . i feel fine .
you do n't look so good . you do n't smell so good either .
true !
it 's you .
hello .
if there are , we 'll all be dead .
fezzik , are there rocks ahead ?
yes , some of the time .
oh , you 've a great gift for rhyme .
he 's really very short on charm .
probably he means no harm .
as you wish ...
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .
okay . okay . okay . all right . so long . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 124 .
okay .
now i think you ought to go to sleep .
i do n't mind so much .
no , it 's kissing again . you do n't want to hear it .
what ? what ?
okay . all right , now , let 's see . where were we ? oh yes . in the pit of despair .
no ! i 'm okay . i 'm okay . -- sit down . all right ?
nobody . nobody kills him . he lives . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 90 .
who kills prince humperdinck ? at the end , somebody 's got to do it . is it inigo ? who ?
i do n't understand .
who gets humperdinck ?
you want me to read this or not ?
westley 's only faking , right ?
-- yes , you 're very smart . shut-up .
see ? did n't i tell you she 'd never marry that rotten humperdinck ?
it was ten days till the wedding . the king still lived , but buttercup 's nightmares were growing steadily worse .
all right , then . no more interruptions . ... at noon , she met her subjects again . this time as their queen .
yes .
do you want me to go on with this ?
i 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !
well , who says life is fair ? where is that written ? life is n't always fair .
you read that wrong . she does n't marry humperdinck , she marries westley . i 'm just sure of it . after all that westley did for her , if she does not marry him , it would n't be fair .
oh . you 're sick , i 'll humor you . so now , where were we here ? yeah , yeah , yeah . ah . oh . okay . westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
skip on to the fire swamp -- that sounded good .
someday , you may not mind so much .
they 're kissing again , do we have to hear the kissing part ?
what is it ? what 's the matter ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 56 .
oh no . no , please .
no . you could read a little bit more ... if you want . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 17 .
because i can stop now if you want .
well , maybe i was a little bit concerned . but that 's not the same thing .
well , i was n't nervous .
the eel does n't get her . i 'm explaining to you because you looked nervous .
what ?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
westley did n't reach his destination . his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts , who never left captives alive . when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered --
i do n't be-leeve this .
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
keep your shirt on . let me read . westley had no money for marriage . so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea .
-- well , when does it get good ?
-- wait , just wait --
what is this ? are you trying to trick me ? -- where 's the sports ? -- is this a kissing book ?
-hold it , hold it-
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around .
yeah . it 's really good .
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there . his name was westley , but she never called him that . is n't that a wonderful beginning ?
oh . well , thank you very much . it 's very nice of you . your vote of confidence is overwhelming . all right . the princess bride , by s. morgenstern . chapter one . buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .
it does n't sound too bad . i 'll try and stay awake .
has it got any sports in it ?
that 's right . when i was your age , television was called books . and this is a special book . it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick , and i used to read it to your father . and today , i 'm gon na read it to you .
a book ?
open it up .
what is it ?
i brought you a special present .
the gate has but one key , and i carry that .
double it . my princess must be safe .
the thieves ' forest is emptied . thirty men guard the castle gate .
rise and report .
try ruling the world sometime .
it wo n't be easy , sire .
form a brute squad then . i want the thieves ' forest emptied before i wed .
many of the thieves will resist . my regular enforcers will be inadequate .
she will not be murdered . on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves ' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .
my spy network has heard no such news .
as chief enforcer of all florin , i trust you with this secret : killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves ' forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night .
sire .
yellin .
wrong ! your ears you keep , and i 'll tell you why --
-- and then my ears , i understand . let 's get on with it
i was n't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye , followed by your right --
-- and then my tongue , i suppose . i killed you too quickly the last time , a mistake i do n't mean to duplicate tonight .
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .
i 'll explain . and i 'll use small words so that you 'll be sure to understand , you wart-hog-faced buffoon .
i do n't think i 'm quite familiar with that phrase .
no . to the pain .
a technicality that will shortly be remedied . but first things first . to the death .
death first ! !
for the last time -- surrender !
it will not happen !
i tell you once again -- surrender !
ah , but how will you capture us ? we know the secrets of the fire swamp . we can live there quite happily for some time . so , whenever you feel like dying , feel free to visit .
i give you full marks for bravery -- do n't make yourself a fool .
you mean you wish to surrender to me ? very well , i accept .
tyrone , you know how much i love watching you work . but , i 've got my country 's five hundredth anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , my wife to murder , and guilder to frame for it . i 'm swamped . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 75 .
now , where is that secret knot ? it 's impossible to find . are you coming down into the pit ? westley 's got his strength back . i am starting him on the machine tonight .
oh , i know . the people are quite taken with her . it 's odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day , i thought that was clever . but it 's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night . once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged . they 'll demand we go to war .
your princess is really a winning creature . a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .
then we will simply alert him . beloved , are you certain he still wants you ? after all , it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp . not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words .
yes .
i could never cause you grief ; consider our wedding off . you returned this westley to his ship ?
of course .
she 's been like that ever since the fire swamp . it 's my father 's failing health that 's upsetting her .
i swear it will be done .
once we 're out of sight , take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair .
i always think everything could be a trap -- which is why i 'm still alive .
could this be a trap ?
the loser is nothing . -- only the princess matters -- -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder . we must be ready for whatever lies ahead . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 42 .
shall we track them both ?
the loser ran off alone . the winner followed those footprints toward guilder !
who won ? how did it end ?
there was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over . they were both masters .
have you ever considered piracy ? you 'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts .
you know , it 's very strange -- i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it 's over , i do n't know what to do with the rest of my life .
in that case --
no .
i thought he was with you .
where 's fezzik ?
light him .
now ?
not yet .
now ?
i 'll say -- how do i find the count ? -- once i do , how do i find you again ? -- once i find you again , how do we escape ? --
true , but that 's hardly common knowledge , is it ? thank you . now , there may be problems once we 're inside .
why ? you ca n't even lift one .
there we can not help you .
well , why did n't you list that among our assets in the first place ? what i would n't give for a holocaust cloak .
your brains , fezzik 's strength , my steel .
and our assets ?
and it is guarded by sixty men .
that does n't leave much time for dilly dallying .
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour , so all we have to do is get in , break up the wedding , steal the princess , make our escape after i kill count rugen .
let me explain -- -- no , there is too much . let me sum up . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 99 .
who are you ? -- are we enemies ? why am i on this wall ? -- where 's buttercup ? --
i 'll beat you both apart . i 'll take you both together .
your guess is as good as mine --
i want my father back , you son- ofa-bitch !
-- anything you want --
-- offer me everything i ask for --
-- all that i have and more please --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- yes --
-- offer me money --
no --
stop saying that !
hello . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die .
okay . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 97 .
thank you for everything .
that is a noble cause . give me the sixty-five , i 'm on the job .
humiliations galore !
sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world . except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe . they 're so perky , i love that . but that 's not what he said . he distinctly said `` to blave . '' and , as we all know , `` to blave '' means `` to bluff . '' so you 're probably playing cards , and he cheated
true love . you heard him . you could not ask for a more noble cause than that .
what 's that ?
now , mostly dead is slightly alive . now , all dead ... well , with all dead , there 's usually only one thing that you can do .
look who knows so much . well , it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead . there 's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead . please open his mouth .
he 's dead . he ca n't talk .
your first story was better . where 's that bellows ? he probably owes you money , huh ? well , i 'll ask him .
i need him to help avenge my father , murdered these twenty years .
are you a rotten liar .
this is noble , sir . his wife is crippled . his children are on the brink of starvation .
sheesh ! i never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 93 .
sixty-five .
do n't rush me , sonny . you rush a miracle man , you get rotten miracles . you got money ?
we 're really in a terrible rush .
hah ?
sir . sir .
he is , eh ? i 'll take a look . bring him in .
he 's already dead .
look , i 'm retired . and besides , why would you want someone the king 's stinking son fired ? i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle .
the king 's stinking son fired me . and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject . while you 're at it , why do n't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it ? we 're closed !
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years ?
what ? what ?
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself . however , since i ca n't have you following me either --
kill me quickly .
okay .
get used to disappointment .
i must know .
no one of consequence .
who are you ? !
i am not left-handed either .
tell me .
there 's something i ought to tell you .
i ought to be after twenty years .
you 're amazing !
i am not left-handed .
and what is that ?
because i know something you do n't know .
then why are you smiling ?
i admit it -- you are better than i am .
thank you -- i 've worked hard to become so .
you are wonderful !
naturally , you must expect me to attack with capo ferro .
i thought it fitting , considering the rocky terrain --
begin !
you seem a decent fellow . i hate to die .
you seem a decent fellow . i hate to kill you .
whether i am or not , you 've been more than fair . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 30 .
you are ready , then ?
well , i certainly hope you find him , someday .
more pursuit than study lately . you see , i can not find him . it 's been twenty years now . i am starting to lose confidence . i just work for vizzini to pay the bills . there 's not a lot of money in revenge .
you 've done nothing but study swordplay ?
i was eleven years old . when i was strong enough , i dedicated my life to the study of fencing . so the next time we meet , i will not fail . i will go up to the sixfingered man and say , `` hello , my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die . ''
how old were you ?
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man . he was a great swordmaker , my father . and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job . he slaved a year before he was done .
do you always begin conversations this way ?
again . thank you .
we 'll wait until you 're ready .
nothing comes to mind .
you do n't know any way you 'll trust me ?
no good . i 've known too many spaniards .
i hate waiting . i could give you my word as a spaniard .
that 's very comforting . but i 'm afraid you 'll just have to wait .
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top .
that does put a damper on our relationship .
i could do that . in fact , i 've got some rope up here . but i do not think that you will accept my help , since i am only waiting around to kill you .
if you 're in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 26 .
i do not suppose you could speed things up ?
thank you .
sorry .
look , i do n't mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks . so i 'd appreciate it if you would n't distract me .
slow going ?
oh , have it your way .
well , it 's the only way i can be satisfied . if i use my right -- tch -- over too quickly .
you know what a hurry we 're in .
i want to duel him left-handed .
you keep using that word -- i do not think it means what you think it means . my god ! he 's climbing .
he did n't fall ? inconceivable ! !
inconceivable !
he 's climbing the rope . and he 's gaining on us .
whoever he is , he 's too late -- -- see ? the cliffs of insanity . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 19 .
look ! he 's right on top of us . i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using .
i do n't swim . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 15 .
go in , get after her !
what ?
no reason . it 's only , i just happened to look behind us , and something is there .
as i told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable . no one in guilder knows what we 've done . and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast . out of curiosity , why do you ask ?
you 're sure nobody 's following us ?
stop doing that . we can all relax , it 's almost over-
that would be inconceivable .
making sure nobody 's following us .
you only think i guessed wrong -- -- that 's what 's so funny ! i switched glasses when your back was turned . you fool .
you guessed wrong .
i 'll tell you in a minute . first , let 's drink -- me from my glass , and you from yours .
what 's so funny ?
i will . and i choose --
then make your choice .
it has worked -- you 've given everything away -- i know where the poison is .
you 're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it wo n't work --
you 'd like to think that , would n't you ? you 've beaten my giant , which means you 're exceptionally strong . so , you could have put the poison in your own goblet , trusting on your strength to save you . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but , you 've also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied . and in studying , you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you 're just stalling now .
yes -- australia , and you must have suspected i would have known the powder 's origin , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 46 .
australia .
wait till i get going ! where was i ?
truly , you have a dizzying intellect .
not remotely . because iocane comes from australia , as everyone knows . and australia is entirely peopled with criminals . and criminals are used to having people not trust them , as you are not trusted by me . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
you 've made your decision then7
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given . i 'm not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but you must have known i was not a great fool ; you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
hmm .
what you do not smell is called iocane powder . it is odorless , tasteless , dissolves instantly in liquid , and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man .
i smell nothing .
inhale this , but do not touch .
good . then pour the wine .
i accept .
for the princess ?
really ? in that case , i challenge you to a battle of wits .
morons .
yes .
let me put it this way : have you ever heard of plato , aristotle , socrates ?
you 're that smart ?
i 'm afraid so -- i ca n't compete with you physically . and you 're no match for my brains .
but if there can be no arrangement , then we are at an impasse .
there will be no arrangement -- -- and you 're killing her !
perhaps an arrangement can be reached .
-- there 's nothing to explain . you 're trying to kidnap what i 've rightfully stolen . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 43 .
let me explain-
bye .
it would take a miracle . bye !
think it 'll work ?
have fun storming the castle .
bye-bye , boys .
a good hour . yeah .
yeah , an hour .
an hour .
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier . but you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency . and you should n't go swimming after , for at least , what ?
humperdinck . humperdinck ! humperdinck !
nobody 's hearing nothing !
a life expiring and you do n't have the decency to say why you wo n't help --
i 'm not listening .
what , humperdinck ? humperdinck . humperdinck . ooo-ooo , humperdinck
why 'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
do n't say another word , valerie .
`` true love . '' he said , `` true love , '' max . my god --
you never had it so good . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 95 .
i 'm not a witch , i 'm your wife . but after what you just said , i 'm not even sure i want to be that anymore .
-- get back , witch --
maybe he wo n't .
he 'll pinch my cheek . i hate that .
you are sick , that 's why he 's here .
mom , ca n't you tell him that i 'm sick ?
your grandfather 's here .
what ?
guess what .
a little bit .
you feeling any better ?
let 's hear him . what have we got to lose ? what 's your name ?
what are you saying ?
wait ! this is boomerang . this is boomerang .
get on the phone . send out a casting call . call every agent in town . i want to see everybody . everybody .
congratulations .
wait a minute . this is a very big decision . it might effect the course of my entire life . i 'll have to think about it . i 'll do it .
that 's genius . that 's genius . roger , i think i speak for mr. bloom and myself when i say that you 're the only man in the world who can do justice to springtime for hitler .
yes . dopey show-girls in gooey gowns . two-three-kick-turn ! turn- turn-kick-turn ! it 's enough to make you throw up ! at last a chance to do straight drama ! to deal with conflict , with inner truth . roger de bris presents history . of course , i think we should add a little music . that whole third act has got to go . they 're losing the war . it 's too depressing . we 'll have to put something in there . aaahghhh ! i see it ! a line of beautiful girls , dressed as storm troopers , black patent leather boots , all marching together ... two-three-kick-turn ! turn-turn- kick-turn !
i think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you , roger . up to now , you 've always been associated with musicals , and ...
please , please , that 's what we 're here for . be careful , that hurt .
roger , do you mind if we talk a little business ?
how would you like to go back to teasing hair , big mouth ?
`` keep a shining in ...
`` honeymoon , honeymoon ,
`` honeymoon ,
`` he 's gon na croon love 's tune ,
`` to my honey i 'll croon ,
`` he wants to croon , he wants to croon ,

`` of the silvery moon ,
`` by the light , by the light ,
he 's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel . he 's taken money from little old ladies . he 's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of . especially me . but who has he really hurt ?
do n't help me .
ahhhhhh . leo , leo , leo .
well , i ... well , it 's just that ... i 'm sorry i called you fat , fat , fat .
what is it ?
max , i ...
what are you doing ? we 're trapped . it 's either the show or us . there 's no way out . what can we do , blow up the theatre ?
liebkind , no !
they are ? have you ever eaten with one ? liebkind , go ! kill !
shut up .
what ? ? ?
here . buy bullets . kill . kill them all !
double . double . double .
ohhhhhhhhh , how i hate you .
i never should have listened to you .
i 'm turning myself in . it 's the only way . i 'm going to cooperate with the authorities . they 'll reduce my sentence and then there 's time off for good behavior . and maybe i 'll get a job in the prison library . so long .
what are you doing with those books ? where are you going ?
the majority . the majority . yes . let 's hear from the majority .
why do n't we go over to the theatre and see what 's really happening ? after all , we 've only heard from a small portion of the audience . let 's hear what the majority thinks .
no way out . no way out . what ? who ?
bloom , bloom , maybe it 's not true .
no way out . no way out .
maybe it 's not true !
to failure !
to failure !
watch closely , as bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin .
here comes the times drama critic .
so much for nutsy fagin .
it 's gorgeous . absolutely gorgeous . you could n't have picked a better color . it brings out your eyes . let 's face it , roger , that dress is you .
well , it 's ... uh ... it 's nice and long ... i mean , it 's ... uh ... uh ... where do you keep your wallet ?
only if we ask him .
do you think he 'll take the job ?
roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived .
roger de bris . roger de bris . oh yes , the director . is he good ... i mean bad ?
stop talking like that , you white mouse ! nothing 's going to go wrong . as a matter of fact , today i have taken steps to insure total disaster . at two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris .
but if something should ... god forbid ... go wrong , at least we could give them some of their money back . it would look better in court .
why ? take it when you can get it ! flaunt it , baby , flaunt it !
max , as i was saying , maybe we should go easy on the spending . i mean these offices and everything .
i 'll show you . ulla , go to work .
what is she gon na do here ?
they 'll say , `` oooh , wah , wah , wah , ooh , ooh . ''
how do you do . have you gone mad ? a receptionist that ca n't speak english . what will people say ?
i 'm going to buy a toy . i worked very , very hard and i think i deserve a toy .
what are you doing ?
oi . i 'm depressed . leo , do me a favor . open the safe . i want to see the money .
then the department of justice owns 100 % of bialystock and bloom .
leo , what if this play is a hit ?
mrs. alma wentworth . she owns 100 % of the profits .
mrs. virginia resnick . she also owns 50 % of the profits .
mrs. eleanor biddlecombe . she also owns 50 % of the profits .
okay , take it off , take it off .
look , i 'm just not wearing this arm band . i do n't care how big the deal is .
there it is ... in red and white ! `` springtime for hitler , '' signed , sealed and delivered . what 's the matter with you ?
shut up , you idiot . he 's a harmless nut . play along with him . it 's almost in the bag .
max , i do n't want to take any siegfried oath . i do n't know what it is , but i do n't want to take it . we might end up in the german army .
who wrote it ?
run a week ? are you kidding ? this play has got to close in the first act .
it wo n't run a week !
a flop , ha ! that 's putting it mildly . a disaster ! a catastrophe ! an outrage ! a guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty !
you found a flop !
i 'll tell you what 's happening . we 've struck gold . not fool 's gold , but real gold . the mother lode . the mother lode . the mother of them all .
max , what is it ? what are you doing ? what 's happening ?
you ca n't feel it when it 's in your hand , when it 's in your pocket .
this is where we belong , leo . on top of the world . top of the world !
i 'll do it ! by god , i 'll do it !
you bet your boots , leo . it 's bialystock and bloom -- on the rise . upward and onward . say , you 'll join me . nothing can stop us .
you 're right . you 're absolutely right . i 'm a nothing . i spend my life counting other people 's money -- people i 'm smarter than , better than . where 's my share ? where 's leo bloom 's share ? i want , i want , i want , i want everything i 've ever seen in the movies !
you think you 're not in prison now ? living in a grey little room . going to a grey little job . leading a grey little life .
yes . that 's it . happy . well , whatta ya think of that . happy .
maybe you 're happy .
i do n't know . i think so . i feel very strange .
everybody 's a big shot . well , leo , are you having a good time ?
two pistachios , my good man .
i do n't know . let 's see . we 've had chocolate , vanilla , banana - let 's go green .
what kind now , leo ?
then stick with bialystock !
right .
nonsense ! as far as whitehall and marks are concerned , you 're working with bialystock , right ?
i ... i love it . i have n't been there since i was a kid . but it 's nearly two o'clock . i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks .
what 's the matter , leo ? do n't you like coney island ?
coney island ? ?
let me see ... it 's such a beautiful day . why waste it indoors . i 've got it ! let 's go to coney island ! we 'll lunch at the sea shore .
well , max , i do n't know , max . what do you think , max ?
where would you like to eat ?
oh .
i already have . come on .
okay ... max ! and you can call me leo .
thank you , leo . and call me max . you know , i do n't let everybody call me max . it 's only people i really like .
i got it , mr. bialystock .
that 's very kind of you , mr. bialystock , but i ...
they certainly do . they certainly do . come , let me take you to lunch .
much , thank you . but i am a little lightheaded . maybe i should eat something . hysterics have a way of severely depleting one 's blood sugar , you know .
well , you know what they say , `` smile and the world smiles with you . '' heh , heh . the man should be in a straight jacket . feeling better ?
good . good . that 's nice . that 's very nice . i think i 'm coming out of it now . yes . yes . i 'm definitely coming out of it . thank you for smiling . it helped a great deal .
how 's this ?
it 's a little better , but you still look angry .
okay . i 'm way over here . is that better ?
go away from me . you frighten me . sit over there .
what can i do ? what can i do ? you 're getting me hysterical .
i 'm hysterical . i 'm having hysterics . i 'm hysterical . i ca n't stop . when i get like this , i ca n't stop . i 'm hysterical .
what are you afraid of ? i 'm not going to hurt you ! what 's the matter with you ?
do n't touch me ! do n't touch me !
will you get a hold on yourself .
aaaaaaaaaa !
i 'm not going to jump on you !
poppea . she was his wife . and she was unfaithful to him . so he got mad and he jumped on her . up and down , up and down , until he squashed her like a bug . please do n't jump on me .
what ? ? ?
you 're going to jump on me . i know you 're going to jump on me -- like nero jumped on poppea .
you 're going to jump on me .
you miserable , cowardly , wretched little caterpillar . do n't you ever want to become a butterfly ? do n't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory ?
oh , i fell on my keys . i 've got to get out of here .
mr. bialystock , not more than five minutes ago , against my better judgment , i doctored your books . that , sir , is the ultimate extent of my criminal life .
no , bloom , you do n't understand . this is fate , this is destiny . there 's no avoiding it .
mr. bialystock . no . wait . please . you 're holding me too tight . i 'm an honest man . you do n't understand .
bloom , worlds are turned on such thoughts !
oh , no . no . no . i meant no scheme . i merely posed a little , academic accounting theory . it 's just a thought .
what scheme ? your scheme , you bloody little genius .
what scheme ?
aha , aha , aha , aha , aha , aha ! ! so , in order for the scheme to work , we 'd have to find a sure fire flop .
oh , you 'd go to jail . if the play were a hit , you 'd have to pay off the backers , and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around , get it ?
but what if the play was a hit ?
see ? you could have raised a million dollars , put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest .
one night .
exactly . and how long did it run ?
but the play only cost $ 60,000 to produce .
ahhhhhh ! but that 's where you made your error . you did n't go all the way . you see , if you were really a bold criminal , you could have raised a million .
so what ? what did it get me ? i 'm wearing a cardboard belt .
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play .
what did i do ?
you 've done it yourself , only you did it on a very small scale .
what do you mean ?
well , it 's very easy . you simply raise more money than you really need .
assume away !
you keep saying that , but you do n't tell me how . how could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit ?
yes , it 's quite possible .
you were saying that under the right circumstances , a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit .
what was i saying ?
what you were saying . keep talking .
yes , what ?
now let 's see , if we add these figures , we get ...
yes . right . good thinking . you figure it out . i 'm tired . i 'm gon na take a little nap . wake me if there 's a fire .
now let 's see , two thousand dollars . that is n't much . i 'm sure i can hide it somewhere . after all , the department of internal revenue is n't interested in a show that flopped .
nothing . nothing . do it . do it .
oh , it 's all right ... wha ?
thank you , bloom . i knew i could con you .
all right . i 'll do it . i 'll do it .
help !
it 's not cheating ... it 's charity . bloom , look at me ... look at me ! i 'm drowning . other men sail through life . bialystock has struck a reef . bloom , i 'm going under . i am being sunk by a society that demands success , when all i can offer is failure . bloom , i 'm reaching out to you . do n't send me to jail . help ! help !
but that 's cheating !
why should they find out ? it 's only two thousand dollars , bloom , do me a favor , move a few decimal points around . you can do it . you 're an accountant . the word 'count ' is part of your title .
it makes a great deal of difference . that 's fraud . if they found out , you could go to prison .
i went to a turkish bath , who cares ? the show was a flop . what difference does it make ?
according to the backer 's list you raised $ 60,000 . but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . there 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .
where ? what ?
this is hardly a time for levity . i 've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play .
yes , prince mishkin , what can we do for you ?
mr. bialystock ...
they come here . they all come here . how do they find me ?
i 'm sorry ... i do n't like people touching my blue blanket . it 's not important . it 's a minor compulsion . i can deal with it if i want to . it 's just that i 've had it ever since i was a baby and ... and ... i find it very comforting .
here , do n't panic .
it 's nothing ... nothing .
what is that ? a handkerchief ?
twenty-eight seconds , hurry , hurry , you 're using up your time .
in looking at your books , i 've discovered that ...
you have forty-eight seconds left . hurry . hurry .
well , sir , it seems ...
go ! you have fifty-eight seconds .
sir , may i speak to you for a minute ?
good , what is it ?
i have hurt your feelings .
i assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention . am i correct in my assumption , you fish-faced enemy of the people ?
koff , koff ... ahem , ahem ... harrumph ...
look at that . a white rolls royce . that 's it baby , when you got it , flaunt it .
window 's so filthy , ca n't tell if it 's day or night out there .
yes , sir . thank you .
do the books ! do the books !
you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect . one ... two ...
shut up . i 'm having a rhetorical conversation . how humiliating . max bialystock . max bialystock .
but sir , i 'm not condem ...
then account for yourself ! do you believe in god ? do you believe in gold ? why are you looking up old lady 's dresses ? bit of a pervert , eh ?
yes sir .
i 'm leo bloom , i 'm an accountant , i 'm from whitehall and marks , i was sent here to do your books and i 'm terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady .
all right . get a hold of yourself . take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are .
scared . ca n't talk .
who are you ? what do you want ? why are you loitering in my hallway ? speak , dummy , speak ! why do n't you speak ?
uh ... uh ... ooooooops ?
ooooooops .
oooooooops !
i 'll wait in the hall ...
you mean ooops , do n't you ? say ooops and get out .
how do you do . i mean ... excuse me ... i mean ...
enough . it 's better . please , lambchop , it 's better . stop . you 're hurting it again .
of course i need you . it 's dark in there .
do you need us ?
i ca n't . i ca n't do it . it 's a demon . it 's a gargoyle , it 's a monster ... but it 's still my child .
do it ! do it !
all right . finish the job . let 's get outta here .
vhy do you always call me kraut ? kraut is cabbage ! do ve call you hot dogs ? ve call you yanks not franks !
yes . amazing is n't it ?
you mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on ?
here . you see . this is the slow fuse . it is much wider . it has more resistance , more density . therefore , it burns slower .
qviet . qviet this is very important .
come on . let 's get going .
plus to minus . negative to positive . male to ...
you mean out of business . heh , heh .
now ve take the two fuse leads , attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve 're in business .
it 's that lsd und his verdampter babies ! ...
never mind . listen . every night people are laughing at your beloved fuhrer . why ?
always .
you crazy lunatic ! what are you shooting at us for ? why do n't you use this where it will do us some good ? why do n't you shoot the actors ? liebkind , have i ever steered you wrong ?
vhere ? vhere ? ... oh ...
i 'm not crazy . i 'm inept .
five o'clock . killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut .
cowards , miserable cringing cowards . clinging to life like baby butterflies . vatch , vatch and remember . franz liebkind vill show you how to die like a man !
not .
all right , but remember , if you damage the fuhrer 's reputation , i kill you .
franz , trust me . i promise i wo n't let you down .
i do n't know . i do n't know .
do n't look at the outside , look at the inside . it 's the inner hitler we 're after . the young beautiful hitler , who danced his way to glory .
but he has long hair !
franz , do n't you see , hitler was a man of his time . this is a man of his time .
vaaaat ? ? ?
it was the same thing in germany . we looked for years before we found the right hitler .
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one ...
good . i will make the preparations .
yes . we would !
not good enough ... vould you be villing to take the siegfried oath ?
we swear it !
wait . no . how do i know i can trust you ? how do i know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived ?
that 's exactly why we want to do this play . to show the world the true hitler , the hitler you knew , the hitler you loved , the hitler with a song in his heart .
that 's because you were taken in by that verdampter allied propaganda . such filthy lies . but nobody said a bad vord about winston churchill , did they ? oh no , vin vit vinnie ! churchill , vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings . could n't even say nazi . he would say narzis , narzis . ve vere not narzies , ve vere nazis . but let me tell this , and you 're getting it straight from the horse , hitler vas better looking than churchill , he vas a better dresser than churchill , had more hair , told funnier jokes , and could dance the pants off churchill !
really , i never dreamed ...
oh , sure . i used to take him his hot milk and his opium . achhh , those were the days . vat good times ve had . dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen , singing und dancing . you know , not many people knew about it , but the fuhrer vas a terrific dancer .
no kidding ?
vit the fuhrer , of course . he liked me . out of all the household staff at berchtesgarten , i vas his favorite . i vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime .
with whom ?
i vas vit him a great deal , you know .
you 're not , as you americans say , dragging my leg , are you ?

we are falling back on all fronts . our soldiers are retreating .
groovy !
we won .
hey , baby , that 's good ! how 'd we come out ?
i told them we invaded england .
what did you tell the people ?
heil , baby ! i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts .
he 's the only cat left that still grooves me .
all right ! might save me a lot of leg-work if i could just talk to your mother . but i 'd need a warrant for that , wo n't i ?
no ! just no ! i have one of those breaking points like any other man , believe it or not , and i 'm near it . there 's just so much pushing i can take and i think ...
sick old women are sharp . come on , i wo n't disturb ...
just for a moment . she might have picked up a hint you 'd miss .
no . i told you , she 's confined ...
your mother met her ? can i talk to your mother ?
that 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . but ... she did n't fool my mother .
i did n't mean that as a slur on your manhood . i 'm sorry .
i 'm not a fool ! and i 'm not capable of being fooled ! not even by women !
or if she had you say ... gallantly protecting her ... you would n't be fooled ... you 'd know she was just using you . would n't you ?
now , look ... !
if she paid you well ?
of course not .
if this girl mary crane were here , you 'd have no reason to hide her would you ?
she 's ... ill. confined to her room . it 's practically living alone .
my mother .
someone is sitting in that window .
i live there . alone .
anyone at home ?
i guess i 've got one of those faces you ca n't help believing .
look , if you wo n't believe me , go ahead . you can help me make beds if you like . come on .
suppose i wanted to search the cabins , all twelve ... would i need a warrant ?
not at all !
she is n't still here , is she ?
i do n't know what you expect me to know about ... people come and go ...
i do mind . if it do n't jell , it ai n't aspic ! this ai n't jelling .
why should she ? i 'm sorry , i have work to do , mr ... if you do n't mind ...
and when she left , she never came back .
cash .
cash or check ? for the cabin ...
what ?
how did she pay you ?
oh . my private parlor . she had an awful hunger ... so i made her some supper . and then she went to bed and left in the morning . i did n't even see her leave .
you said she was sitting `` back there , '' or standing rather ...
what do you mean ?
back where ?
she was tired . she said she had a long drive ahead of her , in the morning ... yes , now i 'm remembering very clearly because i 'm picturing . when you make a picture of the moment in your mind , you can remember every detail . she was sitting back there , no she was standing up , with some sandwich still in her hand , and she said she had to drive a long way .
how do you know she did n't make a call ?
no ! of all ...
you did n't spend the whole night with her did you ?
no .
she did n't call anyone ? even locally ?
no .
or arrived with her .
no .
no one met her ?
the following morning . sunday .
of which morning ?
very early . dawn .
how early ?
she arrived kind of late , wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early .
tell me all about her .
it was raining and her hair did n't look like that ... damped out , i guess .
i did n't lie to you . i just have trouble keeping track of ... time .
do n't know where she got `` marie , '' but `` samuels '' figures . her boy friend 's name is sam . was she in disguise ? or do you want to check the picture again ?
you thought no one has stopped here in weeks . now , try to remember if this girl ...
what ?
now there 's a couple even remarking about your sign , and see how easily you forgot them ?
i do n't even bother with guests registering any more ... i mean , little by little , you drop the formalities . i should n't even bother to change the linen . i guess habits die hard . which reminds me ...
she might have used an alias . mary crane 's the real name , but she might 've registered ...
no . at least i do n't recall .
look at the picture . please .
committing myself to what ? you sure talk like a policeman .
mind looking at the picture before committing yourself ?
no . no one has stopped here in weeks ...
we have reason to believe she came this way ... might have stopped in this area ... did she stop here ?
oh .
i 'm not the police .
i did n't think the police went searching for people who were n't in trouble .
i 'm looking for a missing person . my name 's arbogast , private investigator ... trying to trace a young girl who 's been missing almost a week . from phoenix . it 's a private matter ... family wants to forgive her ... she is n't in trouble .
oh . i thought ... you said you 'd been to so many in two days ... what was it you wanted to ask ?
no .
you out to buy a motel ?
no trouble . today 's linen day . i change all the beds once a week , whether they 've been used or not ... dampness . i hate the smell of dampness . it 's such a dank smell .
sit down . i do n't want to trouble you , just want to ask ...
i do n't really forget the sign , it just does n't seem ... any use . this used to be the main highway . want to register , please ?
in the past two days i 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
i always forget to put the sign on , but we do have vacancy . twelve in fact . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies .
i do n't believe it . do you ?
she was seen leaving town in her car . seen by her very victims , i might add .
did you check in phoenix ... hospitals ... maybe she had an accident ... a hold-up ...
what are you talking about ? what is this ?
must 've needed it .
why ?
your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars .
somebody better tell me what 's going on and tell me fast ! i can take so much and then ...
money .
what 's your interest ?
milt arbogast , private investigator . where is she , miss crane ?
who are you , friend ?
let 's all talk about mary .
i do n't care if you do or ... i want to see mary ... before she gets in any deeper ...
with a little checking , i could get to believe you .
not even a hunch . just hope .
you came up here on a hunch , miss crane ? nothing more ? no phone call ... from him , or from your sister herself ?
sam , if she 's here ...
casharoonie !
sam , they do n't want to prosecute , they just want the money back . it was all in cash ...
someone has seen her . someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars . she is your girl friend , is n't she ?
would n't have been able to tail you if you did .
i do n't know .
okay . if you 'll come along ...
i 'd like to be ready when he gets back .
no , m'am . i was only about to say , i 've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test ... that 's all .
but what ? is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ?
i 'll be perfectly honest with you , ma'am . it 's not that i do n't trust you , but ...
i 'd really rather not . please . ca n't we just settle this and ...
i think you 'd better give it a trial spin . do n't want any bad word of mouth about california charlie .
in the building ... mary starts for the building , glancing once in the direction of the patrolman .
i think i have the necessary papers . is there a ladies room ...
i take it ... you can prove that car 's yours ... i mean , out of state and all ... got your pink slip and your ...
all right .
aha ! always got time to argue money , huh ... ?
five hundred .
well ... heck , this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman ! i 'd figure roughly ... ... your car plus five hundred .
of course not . please .
you mean you do n't want the usual day and a half to think it over ? you are in a hurry ! somebody chasin ' you ?
it looks fine . how much will it be , with my car ... ?
go ahead ! spin it around the block . now i know you do n't know anything about engine condition , but you can feel , ca n't you ... and it 's all in the feel , believe me , you feel that one around the block ...
how much ?
that 's the one i'd 've picked for you myself !
no . thank you . i 'm in ... a hurry . i just want to make a change and start ...
sick of the sight of it ! well , suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i 'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and ... want some coffee ? i was just about ...
yes , it 's ... nothing wrong with it , i 'm just ...
you can do anything you 've a mind to ... and bein ' a woman , you will ! that yours ?
can i trade in my car and take another ?
there 's an old saying , `` first customer of the day is always the most trouble ! '' but like i said , i 'm in no mood for it so i 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you wo n't have one human reason to give me ...
what ?
i 'm in no mood for trouble !
i do n't need pills ... just sleep .
are n't you going to take the pills ? they 'll knock that headache out .
teddy called . me ... and my mother called to see if teddy called . oh , and your sister called to say she 's going to tucson to do some buying and she 'll be gone the whole weekend and ...
were there any calls ?
you got aspirins ? i have something ... not aspirins , but my mother 's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding . teddy was furious when he found out i 'd taken tranquilizers !
it 'll pass . headaches are like resolutions ... you forget them soon as they stop hurting .
he 's lunching with the man who 's buying the harris street property , you know , that oil lease man ... so that 's why he 's late . you getting a headache ?
is n't mr. lowery back from lunch ?
her sister 's going to do that . she 's as worried as we are .
you better run out to the house . she may be ... unable to answer the phone ...
i called her sister , mr. lowery , where she works , the music makers music store , you know ? and she does n't know where mary is any more than we do .
call her sister ! if no one 's answering at the house ... .
buzz me the minute she comes in .
no , mr. lowery ... but then she 's always a bit late on monday mornings .
caroline ... ? mary still is n't in ?
yes , mr. lowery .
i do n't know .
can see you do . sorry i could n't make you feel better . you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person ... and the theft , is what you want to do ! sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law , that 's the sooner you 'll stand a chance of your sister bein ' picked up . how about that ?
i still feel ...
just what he told your detective .
did he say anything about my sister ?
norman bates ' mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years !
yes .
your detective told you a nakedfaced lie .
what difference does that ...
you should 've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped . you go starting private investigations , using people you do n't even know ...
sorry i got you up , boy . go back to sleep . yeah , be glad to . said to give you his regards .
please !
he said he was dissatisfied ... and was going back .
i think something 's wrong , too , miss . but not the same thing . i think your private detective is what 's wrong . i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going ... probably from norman bates ... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money .
go out there ! find somebody , ask some questions ! i 'm sorry if i seem over-anxious to you . i keep thinking ... something 's wrong . i have to know what !
like what ?
he did n't mention the money . what he said on the phone is n't important , is it ? he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother , and he did n't ! that 's what i want you to do something about !
with the forty thousand dollars ?
mary had been there , one night , and had left .
and the police have n't been able to ...
forty thousand dollars .
a lot ?
she stole some money .
she ai n't missing so much as she 's run away .
yes .
how 'd you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale ?
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday . and no trace until ...
now . your sister is missing how long ?
will you help us ? i think something 's wrong out there !
i could stand something regular .
it 's regular . okay ?
bates .
why not ?
you ca n't go up there .
sam , that old woman , whoever she is . i think she told arbogast something ! and i want her to tell us the same thing !
do we simply ask him where he 's hidden it ?
yes . but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money .
bates never denied mary was here .
that 's proof mary was here ! it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to ...
it did n't get washed down . it 's figuring ... the kind you tear up and get rid of . some figure has been added to or subtracted from ... forty thousand .
what is it ?
the bathroom . look at how clean it is . the one in our cabin is clean ... but this is clean !
what ?
hospital clean .
sorry .
arbogast ! sam , he liked me ... or felt sorry for me ... and he was starting to feel the same about you . i heard it when he called ... in his voice , a caring . he would n't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us . unless he was stopped . and he was stopped , so he must have found out something !
what makes you sound so certain ?
there must be some proof that exists right now ! something that proves he got that money away from mary ... some way !
how could we prove ... well , if he opens a new motel on the new highway ... say , a year from now ...
sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel ... one you probably could n't even sell ... what would you need to get away , to start a new business , somewhere else ? forty thousand dollars ?
i know . do you think if something happened , it happened there ?
we have to go into that cabin and search it , sam ... no matter what we 're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt .
i 'm glad we did n't .
we should have asked for cabin one ... the one mary was in .
someone was at that window . i saw the curtain move .
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting ?
i believe it .
you wo n't believe it ... but this will be the first time i 've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers !
we 're going to register . as man and wife . and get shown to a cabin ... and then search every inch of that place , inside and ... outside .
i 'm going with you . but we 'd better decide what we 're going to say and do when we walk in ...
you going to wait here for me ?
she always tries to be proper .
huh ?
watch your tenses .
i suppose ... when you were able to marry her she 'd have presented you , all shiny and proper ... she always tried to be proper .
this is the old highway .
do you know how i found out about you ? i found one of your letters ... it was a nice letter , sam .
we were going to get married . are going to get married !
i wonder so many things about her now . why she never told me about you ... funny , when you think there 's an answer to everything , you think you know all the answers .
she was willing to lick the stamps .
i did n't . i got a job , too . i wonder if that hurt her , my not letting her sacrifice for me ? some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you do n't let them .
where 'd you go to college ?
alive .
of course we will .
i wonder if we 'll ever see mary again .
neither will i .
i wo n't feel satisfied unless i got out there , sam .
you 're not .
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type .
all right ! then call ! at least , call !
i 've only been here five . right now it feels like ten , but ...
this is lila crane , from phoenix . she 's been here for a few days , looking for her sister . there 's a private detective helping ... and , well , we got a call tonight , from this detective , saying he 'd traced mary ...
yes .
i do n't know where to start ... except at the beginning .
no , thank you . it 's my problem , too .
no . i 'm just procrastinating . people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night . come on .
does that mean we ca n't ...
nothing . just ... all the lights out ... must be asleep .
well ?
our deputy sleeps .
he 's the deputy sheriff around here .
who 's he ?
let 's go see al chambers .
yes . i think he would have .
sam , he called me when he had nothing definite , nothing but a dissatisfied feeling . do n't you think he 'd have called if he had anything ...
in a hurry .
without calling me ?
maybe he got some definite lead . maybe he went right on ...
where could he have gone ?
no arbogast . no bates . and only the old lady at home ... a sick old lady unable to answer the door ... or unwilling .
sam .
he did n't come back here ?
contemplate your ... panic button .
just wait here ?
i do n't know ... one of us has to be here in case arbogast 's on the way .
why ca n't i go out there with you ?
stay here .
you 'll never find it .
sam , i 'm going .
probably on his way back right now .
and maybe pass arbogast on the road ? thanks .
sam ! why call when we can go ?
got the number of the motel out on the old highway ? bates , i think .
an hour ! or less !
arbogast said ...
patience does n't run in our family . sam , i 'm going out there !
that would n't be a wise thing to do .
yes .
you want to run out there , bust in on arbogast and the sick old lady , shake her up and maybe spoil everything arbogast 's been building for the last three hours .
where 's the old highway ?
i feel better when you feel better .
whenever i start contemplating the panic button , your back straightens up and your eyes get that god-looks- out-for-everybody look and ... i feel better .
hundreds ! which one is your pet ?
you have an awfully nice habit , sam .
he 'll be back . let 's sit still and hang on , okay ?
are we just going to go on sitting here ?
it 's been three .
sam . he said an hour . or less .
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound . ever notice , lila ?
first rate hotel , fifty yards up the street . come on . after we check you in we 'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich . then we 'll come back here ... and wait .
where ... can i stay ?
she 'll need both of us .
you want me to stay here ?
i think she 'll contact me if she contacts anybody . why do n't you stay here . when she shows up ... or calls ... be here .
i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation ... for all i know , she may be trying to get in touch with me , at home . i 'd better go home .
maybe we can handle it together .
no . i just think ... anything can be explained . but mary , doing a thing like this ... i do n't know how to handle ...
you 've led a charmed life .
i need to ... i need to believe something . this is the first time i 've ever come up against anything i could n't ... understand .
i did n't see her ... and i did n't hear from her ! believe that !
she have n't even called you ?
how could i go away ? i 'm in debt up to my ... if she did steal that money ... it 's hard to believe she did because it 's hard to see why she would . unless she had some wild idea that it would help me ... us ...
why not ? sam , is she hiding here ? are you two planning to go away with the money ?
no .
i ought to call the police right now !
he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it ... all that cash ...
no . the man whose money she ... he talked so loud and fast , and i ... i should 've called the police .
it was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ?
i just listened ... and believed everything they told me . 'she stole the money . ' 'we do n't want to get her in trouble . ' 'no do n't bring the police in ' ...
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so , sister .
yes ... i just ... did . the moment they told me ...
never mind my ego . let 's talk about mary .
not that kind ... you men and your egos .
well why did n't she come to me ... call me ... ?
yes .
is mary ... in trouble ?
i hate tears .
what thing could we be in together ?
huh ?
what thing ?
look , if you two are in this thing together , i do n't care , it 's none of my business ... but i want to see mary . i want her to tell me she 's all right and it 's none of my business . then i 'll go back to phoenix and ...
nothing ! you 're putting me on the defensive .
what do you know about it ?
i was getting to that !
mr. loomis , you 're so busy being defensive that you have n't even reacted to the most serious fact of all . mary is missing .
well what do you think , we eloped or something ? or we 're living in sin and ...
a good reason , i suppose .
and you thought she 'd come up here , to me ? if she had , what reason would she have for not calling you ?
last friday . she left work , and home ... i was in tucson over the weekend ... i have n't heard from her , not even a phone call .
no . i take it you do n't either ? how long ?
to begin with , where mary is . do you ?
what should i know ?
do n't you know ?
what 's the matter ?
i do n't know where . in your store , somewhere in your town ... anywhere .
where ?
with you .
here ?
i want to know if my sister is here .
is something wrong ?
is mary here ?
lila .
i 'm mary 's sister .
sure ...
may i talk to you ?
yes ?
i 'm late ... and you have to put your shoes on .
hey , we can leave together ca n't we ?
do n't miss your plane .
how can you even think a thing like that !
i 'm thinking of it .
you know what i 'd like ? a clear , empty sky ... and a plane , and us in it ... and somewhere a private island for sale , where we can run around without our ... shoes on . and the wherewithal to buy what i 'd like . mary , you want to cut this off , go out and find yourself someone available .
i 'll lick the stamps .
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale . we 'll have a lot of laughs . when i send my ex-wife her money , you can lick the stamps .
sam , let 's go get married .
yeah , but when you do ... you 'll swing .
i have n't even been married once yet !
a couple of years and the debts will be paid off . and if she ever re- marries , the alimony stops ... and then ...
i pay , too . they also pay who meet in hotel rooms .
i 'm fed up with sweating for people who are n't there . i sweat to pay off my father 's debts ... and he 's in his grave ... i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony , and she 's living on the other side of the world somewhere .
i 'm all for it ! it requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out ... otherwise , though , it 's only hard work . but if i can see you , touch you even as simply as this ... i wo n't mind .
you make respectability sound ... disrespectful .
mary , whenever it 's possible , tax- deductible or not , i want to see deductible you . and under any conditions . even respectability .
all right .
sam ! no !
and after the steak ... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama 's picture to the wall ?
we can see each other , we can even have dinner ... but respectably , in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three !
not even just to see you , to have lunch ... in public ?
no .
i can come down next week .
i have to go , sam .
i wish i were . not an active criminal but ... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal . next best thing to no conscience at all .
you could n't be a criminal if you committed a major crime .
and besides , when you say i make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal .
sure . it 's like laughing through a broken jaw , but ...
can you ?
you ca n't laugh at it , huh ?
it is tragic ! or it will be ... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here ...
and i 'm a working man ! we 're a regular working-class tragedy !
i have n't time to argue . i 'm a working girl .
okay . what do we do instead , write each other lurid love letters ?
this ! meeting you in secret so we can be ... secretive ! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and ... i wish you would n't even come .
for what ?
sam . this is the last time .
the only girlish thing you have lost .
i 've lost my girlish laughter .
i 'm sorry , mary . my old dad used to say 'when you ca n't change a situation , laugh at it . ' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it .
sam !
you sure talk like a girl who 's been married .
when you 're married you can do a lot of things deliberately .
i 've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels . they say it ...
checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort are n't interested in you when you come in , but when your time 's up ... sam , i hate having to be with you in a place like this .
we could laze around here a while longer .
what do i do with my free afternoon , walk you to the airport ?
call your boss and tell him you 're taking the rest of the afternoon off . it 's friday anyway ... and hot .
good night .
that 's it .
crane .
alright , miss ...
very early . dawn .
alright . i 'll see you in the morning . i 'll bring you breakfast . what time will you ...
i 'd like to , but ...
why do n't you stay a little while , just for talking .
i stepped into a private trap back there -- and i want to go back and ... try to pull myself out . before it 's too late for me , too .
phoenix ?
i 'm very tired . and i 'll have a long drive tomorrow . all the way back to phoenix .
you 're not going to ... to your room already ?
norman .
thank you , norman .
yes , and just one time can be enough . thank you .
i 've suggested it myself . but i hate to even think such a thing . she needs me ... and it is n't ... ... it is n't as if she were a maniac , a raving thing ... it 's just that ... sometimes she goes a little mad . we all go a little mad sometimes . have n't you ?
well ? you meant well ? people always mean well , they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that ...
i am sorry . i only felt ... it seemed she was harming you . i meant ...
what do you mean about caring ? have you ever seen one of those places ? inside ? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you ... and my mother there ? why ? has she harmed you ? she 's as harmless as ... one of these stuffed birds .
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ...
an institution ? a madhouse ? people always call a madhouse `` someplace . '' put her in someplace !
would n't it be better if you put her in ... someplace ...
it 's too late for me . and besides ... who 'd look after her ? she 'd be alone up there , the fire would go out ... damp and cold , like a grave . when you love someone , you do n't do that to them , even if you hate them . oh , i do n't hate her . i hate ... what she 's become . i hate ... the illness .
no , not like me .
to a private island , like you ?
why do n't you go away ?
a son is a poor substitute for a lover .
except you .
i mean ... ill. she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died ... i was only five ... and it must have been a strain . oh , she did n't have to go out to work or anything , dad left us with a little something ... anyway , a few years ago ... mother met a man . he talked her into building this motel ... we could have talked her into anything ... and when . well ... it was just too much for her when he died , too ... and the way he died ... oh , it 's nothing to talk about when you 're eating . anyway , it was too much of a loss for my mother ... she had nothing left .
she sounded strong ...
sometimes when she talks that way to me i 'd like to ... curse her out and leave her forever ! or at least , defy her . but i could n't . she 's ill .
if anyone ever spoke to me , the way i heard ... the way she spoke to you , i do n't think i could ever laugh again .
oh i do ... but i say i do n't .
you should ... mind it .
i was born in mine . i do n't mind it anymore .
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps .
no . people never run away from anything . the rain did n't last very long . you know what i think ? i think we 're all in our private traps , clamped in them , and none of us can ever climb out . we scratch and claw ... but only at the air , only at each other , and for all of it , we never budge an inch .
why do you ask that ?
what are you running away from ?
i 'm looking for a private island .
where are you going ? i do n't mean to pry ...
only my share .
friends ? who needs friends . a boy 's best friend is his mother . you 've never had an empty moment in your whole life . have you ?
you go out ... with friends ?
oh , no ! i run the office , tend the cabins and grounds , do little chores for mother ... the ones she allows i might be capable of doing .
is your time so empty ?
it 's more than a hobby ... sometimes ... a hobby is supposed to pass the time , not fill it .
a man should have a hobby .
it 's not as expensive as you 'd think . cheap , really . needles , thread , sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything .
i imagine so .
uncommon , too .
it 's a strange hobby . curious , i mean .
not really . i hear that expression , that one eats `` like a bird , '' is really a falsie , i mean a falsity , because birds eat a tremendous lot . oh , i do n't know anything about birds . my hobby is stuffing things ... taxidermy . and i guess i 'd just rather stuff birds because ... well , i hate the look of beasts when they 're stuffed , foxes and chimps and all ... some people even stuff dogs and cats ... but i ca n't ... i think only birds look well stuffed because they 're rather ... passive , to begin with ... most of them ...
you 'd know , of course .
you eat like a bird .
it 's all for you . i 'm not hungry . please go ahead .
you 're very ... kind .
do n't worry about it . but as long as you 've made us supper , we may as well eat it . huh ?
i 'm sorry . i wish ... people could apologize for other people .
you should n't have bothered . i really do n't have that much of an appetite .
mother ... ... what is the phrase ... `` she is n't herself today '' ... i think that 's it .
i 've caused you some trouble .
all right , you get your dresses hanging out and ... change those wet shoes , and i 'll come for you soon as it 's ready ... ... with my trusty umbrella .
i 'd like to .
then will you do me a favor ? will you have supper here ? i was just about to , myself ... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk , but i 'd like it if you 'd come up to the house and ... i do n't set a fancy table but ... the kitchen 's awful homey .
no .
you 're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner , are you ?
thank you . again .
there 's no name for it ... but it 's something that , that puts a person at ease .
i have ?
you have something most girls never have .
norman bates .
thank you , mr. bates .
i 'll be in the office if you want anything ... just tap on the wall .
the bathroom .
stuffy in here . well ... the mattress is soft and there 're hangers in the closet and ... stationary with `` bates ' motel '' printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious ... and ... the ... over there ... .
fifteen miles . i 'll get your bags .
am i that close to fairvale ?
there 's a big diner about ten miles on up ... just outside fairvale .
i want sleep more than anything . except maybe , food .
los angeles .
your home address . oh , just the town will do .
i knew you must have . no one stops here anymore unless they do .
i thought i 'd gotten off the main ...
we have twelve vacancies . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies . they moved away the highway .
you have a vacancy ?
dirty night .
please .
why ?
may i see your license ?
now what ?
wait a minute !
no need to apologize ...
i 'm sorry .
in the course of my duty , i never `` take up '' anyone 's time , whether it 's to give a warning , or a ticket , or help ! believe that , m'am . now if you woke up on the wrong side of ... the car seat , that 's one thing . but when you act as if i 've just placed you under arrest ...
now wait just a moment ! turn your motor off , please .
is there what ? i 've told you there 's nothing wrong ... except that i 'm in a hurry and you 're taking up my time ...
is there ?
please ... i 'd like to go ...
frankly , yes .
of course not ! am i acting as if ... something 's wrong ?
is anything wrong ?
then i 'm free to go ... ?
no , m'am .
i did n't intend to sleep all night ! i just pulled over ... have i broken any laws ?
there are plenty of motels in this area . you should have ... i mean , just to be safe ...
yes . as i said , i could n't keep my eyes ...
you slept here all night ?
yes . i did n't mean to sleep so long . i was afraid i 'd have an accident last night , from sleepiness ... so i decided to pull over ...
in quite a hurry .
he 's already been .
we thought , if you did n't mind , we 'd go out to the motel with you .
i 'd know the difference between mary and an old woman .
maybe you saw mary !
you mean that old woman i saw sittin ' in the window was n't norman bates ' mother ?
no . an old woman , his mother . that was early this evening . and we have n't seen or heard from him since . i went out to the motel , just got back . no one was in the office , and ...
norman took a wife ?
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates ...
bates ' motel . he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it ... go on , sam .
yes . he traced her to that motel , out on the old highway ...
mary is lila 's sister ?
let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking .
we have a problem .
you did n't ! it 's tinkerbell . al wants to be sure he 'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night . well come on in , at least !
sorry , mrs. chambers . i hate bothering you ...
oh ?
have you two had breakfast ?
went out before service .
norman found them dead together . in bed .
it ai n't only local history , sam , it 's the only murder-and-suicide case in fairvale ledgers ! mrs. bates poisoned this guy she was ... involved with , when she found out he was married , then took a helping of the same stuff herself . strychnine . ugly way to die .
i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in . periwinkle blue .
he told you he was n't coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates ' mother , right ?
barefaced .
arbogast . and after he left ? no , it 's okay , norman . how 's it been going out there ? well , i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action , a smaller place , you know ... but ...
arbogast .
norman ? sheriff chambers . been just fine , thanks . listen , we got some worries here . did you have a man stop out there tonight ... well , this one would n't be a customer , anyway . a private detective , name of ...
you must remember that bad business out there . about ten years ago ...
recluse . kinder word .
at this hour ?
why do n't you call norman and let him say just what happened , if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off ... it 'll make the girl feel better , albert .
leave me alone !
... forty thousand dollars !
leave me alone !
where will you get the money to do that , bates ... or do you already have it ... socked away ... a lot of it ...
shut up !
buy a new one ! in a new town ! where you wo n't have to hide your mother !
do what ?
i 've been talking about your mother ... about your motel . how are you going to do it ?
i do n't know what you 've been saying .
you look frightened . have i been saying something frightening ?
i did n't think so .
my mother is not dead !
and now that your mother 's dead ?
this place ! this is n't 'a place . ' it 's my only world . i grew up in that house back there . i was a happy child . my mother and i ... we were more than happy .
i 'm not saying you should n't be contented here , i 'm just doubting that you are . i think if you saw a chance to get out from under ... you 'd unload this place ...
just an expression ... what i meant was ... i 'd do just about anything ... to get away . would n't you ?
that would be a rather extreme reaction , would n't it ?
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance . yet there you are , doing all the listening ! you are alone here , are n't you ? it would drive me crazy .
yes .
i 've been doing all the talking so far , have n't i ?
fine .
satisfied with your cabin ?
yes , matter of fact . the wife 's taking a nap and ... i can never keep quiet enough for her ... so i thought i 'd look you up and ... talk .
looking for me ?
i 'll show you the cabin .
have n't any .
i 'll get your bags .
uh , uh ! my boss is paying for this trip ... ninety percent business ... and he wants practically notarized receipts . i better sign in and get a receipt .
it is n't necessary .
better sign in first , has n't we ?
i 'll take you to ...
we 'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco , but we do n't like the look of that sky . looks like a bad day coming ... does n't it .
i suppose you want a cabin .
just coming up to ring for you .
shut up ! shut up !
go on , go tell her she 'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food ... or my son ! or do i have to tell her , cause you do n't have the guts ? huh , boy ? you have the guts , boy ?
mother , she 's just a stranger ! as if men do n't desire strangers , as if ... oh , i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me ! you understand , boy ?
mother , she 's just a stranger ... hungry , and the weather 's bad ...
and then what ? after supper , music ? whispers ?
mother , please ...
i wo n't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper ... ... by candlelight , i suppose , in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap , erotic minds !
you must 've seen an illusion , sam . now , i know you 're not the seeing- illusion type ... but no woman was illusion there and i do n't believe in ghosts , so there it is !
no mother .
nothing . here , let 's clear the path .
you did n't find anything .
and you want to tell me you saw norman bates ' mother .
yes ! in the house behind the motel . i pounded and called but she ... just ignored me .
now wait a minute , sam . you sure you saw an old woman ?
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away .
was that all ?
he was n't out when you were there . he just was n't answering the door in the dead of night ... like some people do . this fellow lives like a hermit ...
he was out when i was there . if he 's back he probably is n't even in bed yet .
explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what 'd he exactly say when he called you ?
everyone concerned thought ... if they could get her to give back the money ... they could avoid involving her with the police .
from what ?
yes .
left phoenix under her own steam ?
they thought she 'd be coming to me .
what -- special autopsy ?
that 's the one that 's got the coroner doing nightwork .
did i ?
you did n't even mention the suicides . did you notice the beaut that came in today ?
yeah , between the gangsters and the autos , we wo n't need another war to carry off the population .
by gosh , them stiffs are get- tin ' heavier and more of 'em every day . they even got the coroner working overtime .
[ was it ] & quot ; meirschultz & quot ; ?
said & quot ; doctor & quot ; -- [ something ]
did she talk ?
just before she died she came to --
never mind your theories . was she ever conscious ?
imagine -- she was alive . what a horror . could have been buried alive . she must have run away from the morgue .
how about me getting the help . she 's quiet now , is n't she ?
that 's what i said . now , lis- ten to me . i want you to help me take this woman down stairs . i will give her a shot . you can take care of her till i get help .
what do you mean & quot ; our & quot ; ?
quiet , will you ? this is ser- ious . our lives are in danger .
ha ha , < u > you < /u > have been treating .
i knew there was a catch in this some place -- but spill it . quiet and dramatic . maxwell in the other room , i have a crazy woman that i have been treating .
no , i would n't be surprised at anything from you . winningly . maxwell now , honey -- you are here in time to help me and you can --
sure -- i have one little job to accomplish , then we can leave together . no doubt you are surprised at this disguise .
then you knew of the inheritance ?
[ perfectly friendly , my dear . ] at last , i have really a secure living for us . we can travel or anything we choose .
so -- friendly or otherwise -- ?
sh -- sh -- i want to have a few words with you quietly .
gosh , you had me fooled .
okay -- i 'll be here at eight .
that 's only natural . maxwell will be here around eight tonight .
do n't tell him . i want to be the first to bring him the news .
i am certainly glad to hear it . i know he 'll be pleased .
he hardly knew of them him- self . i believe it was his uncle in australia .
you say a fortune . he never spoke to me of any rich relatives .
he 's inherited a fortune .
indeed , he has often told me .
it is -- you know what a struggle he 's had .
no , not exactly . why the great anxiety ? it must be something important .
you mean he does n't work for you ?
i understand my husband is -- your assistant . may i see him please ?
did you wish to see someone ?
take him to the psychopathic hospital .
yes -- i ca n't stand it -- everybody wants papers -- oh , oh
dr. meirschultz , too ?
papers -- they all want me to sign papers .
tell me , just what you know of dr. meirschultz .
hm -- pressure -- to buckley . that 's all right . we 'll talk later .
no , no ! i wo n't sign any pa- pers . you ca n't make me --
i do n't know -- i ca n't tell --
why , yes , to you , mr. -- mr. -- what ?
you -- a friend to me ?
no , i do n't want money . i only want to find out who you are and where you live . my business is finding peo- ple . not taking their money .
maybe you want my money , too .
who wants your money -- maybe i can help you .
no -- i do n't want to give any money . everybody wants money -- i 'm not going to give any money .
what made you steal ? are you hungry ?
i do n't know , [ i tell you ] .
who are you ? what is your name ?
no-
why did n't you notify the police ?
i know i am . why , i even heard a shot up there last night .
maybe you 're right .
it may be , but to my notion , those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later .
that sounds to me very remarkable .
sure -- they 're sorta queer , i 'd say . they 's lots of queer goings on up there . they even brought a dog back to life once .
by the way -- did you hear a shot last night ?
oh , him . he has a cat of his own . but his assistant -- he 's the cat-hatenest man i ever saw . goofy , if ya ast me . ]
you 're not as quick as i thought . i figgered out that rats breed faster than cats -- cat skins make good fur -- the cats eat rats . rats eat raw meat . that is , they eat the carcasses of the cats . so -- the cats eat the rats -- the rats eat the cats . and i get the skins -- simple ai n't it ?
but where do the rats come in ?
that 's it . you get it quick .
oh , i see . cats ' fur .
oh , no . it 's my own idea . i 'm in the business . in the fur business .
what ' s the idea [ of wanting so many ] do you sell them [ to the doctor ] ?
sure , got thousand cats , too . look at 'em -- points to cages of cats .
thousands ?
yeah -- thousands , and right in my back yard .
[ lot of ] how many cats you have -- what 's the matter -- rats ?
he 's been stealing my cats to experiment on [ them ] . i know cause i 've been [ watching ] spying on him .
i understand from your neighbors that all [ them ] cats are making noise at night . dr. meirschultz has put in a complaint .
come on , we 're wasting time .
oh , < u > i 'm < /u > crazy , am i ? let me tell you something . those women have -- the gleam --
man , you 're crazy . what kind of a place is this ?
it wo n't do any good . they are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out .
take me down there .
oh , nothing . a cou- ple of my patients having a little argument .
what 's that ?
oh , nothing . he is crazy , that 's all . i had a little trouble with him .
yes . mr. buckley thinks you treated him a little rough . he 's in the hospital . how about it ?
you here again ?
i 'd like to have a look .
oh , just the basement . some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there . it will save me from intrusion .
what 's down there ?
mind if i look around ? seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments . sure of himself but taking no chances . maxwell sure , i 'll take you thru .
oh no . mostly research in endocrinology .
do you have many patients , doctor ?
fine . mrs. buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea .
oh , yes , he 's in good hands now .
yes indeed . he has been a < u > difficult < /u > case . now that < u > you < /u > have him in custody -- you have him have n't you ?
so -- that 's it . buckley took the body .
why , buckley stole that body . that 's what alarmed mrs. buckley so . i have been try- ing to get her to put buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him .
yeah , he was picked up -- also the body from the morgue . say , what did you have to do with stealing that body ?
well , news of buckley ?
how do you do .
oh , maxwell ? he 's left .
by the way , where < u > is < /u > your assistant ?
you found buckley ?
i 'm detective jones . just dropped in to tell you a bit of news .
oh , so you feel that way too . motions to other room . stay in there -- i 'll call you when needed .
it sounds all right , except for the fact that she 's crazy . it seems to me she has the right idea -- .
[ something very important . i have been threatened ; ] mrs. maxwell , my assistant 's wife , is crazy . she thinks i mur- dered her husband . [ she wants to murder me . ] i want you to help me quiet her -- give her a shot from this hypo . [ keep it hid till we get her ] down in the basement -- there is a secret vault [ there ] . we will put her there till we get your husband -- [ then turn her over to the authorities . then we will both be free . ]
how ? what can i do ?
you are right . but before i can get him back here , you will have to help me .
not so fast , mrs. buckley . that was your idea !
you ca n't double-cross me like that . you were to help me . you were to operate on him . you were going to put him under my power .
no , you ca n't do that -- they 'll get suspicious --
i 'm going to call the police .
what are you going to do ?
he is n't here .
dr. meirschultz , please .
nonsense ! ... it 's here ! ... your blood ...
yes !
you 're losing your blood ?
i 'm losing my blood !
what is it now ?
go to sleep !
the wound is bleeding !
what is it ?
the master ... is asleep !
yes !
your father ?
what did it say ?
that called ... commanded ...
that spoke to you ?
a voice ...
what were you dreaming about ?
no ! good night !
no ?
there 's no child here , and no dogs either .
but ... the dogs ...
there 's no child here .
yes .
the child !
yes , the child ...
did you hear ?
the blood transfusion is completed . while marc himself is looking after the patient , the nurse leads nikolas into an adjoining room , where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage . the doctor stands bending over lone .
another fragment of the diary is shown [ having to do with vampires ] .
the blood transfusion continues . marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp , so that he can see nikolas in bright light , while he himself sits in the dark . nikolas watches lone 's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death . life slowly seems to return to her , and her breathing becomes more peaceful . she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her , but she is much too enfeebled to speak , and closes her eyes again . marc keeps a close watch on nikolas , who grows paler and paler . his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again .
joseph is reading the diary , which arouses his interest more and more . it is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him . an extract from the diary is shown .
the blood transfusion is now in progress . the only words are curt orders like : 'now ! - quickly ! - that 's enough ! - give it to me ! - sit still ! ' etc .
joseph returns from the room where gisle is . he has evidently succeeded in calming her . he goes and sits in the chair where nikolas sat . he rests his head in his hand . he sees the open diary and begins reading it .
by the time we return there , all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed .
it 's igor at the wax museum ! you 'll find your judge embalmed in wax ! he 's a statue of voltaire , with all the other corpses ! the whole place is a morgue -- do you hear ? -- a morgue !
you lie !
no -- the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight .
but you were in on it -- you worked for him .
no -- i did n't . it was igor at the waxworks .
you killed him ! come on with the rest of it . you killed him !
well , thank goodness , that 's settled .
i think so .
yeah , but they leave you plenty .
if you 're going to be indiscreet , i wish you 'd be a little more discreet about it . rich men , like winton , love you and leave you .
no ? give me a chance , baby . money is music in my ears , and when his old man kicks off there 'll be a million dollar tune .
you would n't get mixed up with that little rotter , would you ?
i 'm hungry . i 'll eat the first child i see . and i 've an appointment with young winton at 8:30 .
what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time .
ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you .
why did n't you eat last night ?
i ca n't convince the inner woman that we can wait . she 's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies . i 've only had a cup of coffee since last night .
there 's no hurry . it 's early .
i 'll have it for supper . so long .
but what about lunch ?
then marry ralph ... you 'll be the happiest couple in the world .
you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier .
he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough .
you would .
all right , you raise the kids -- i 'll raise the roof . i 'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers , than expire in a pan of dirty dish water .
i do n't agree with you .
i 've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i 've never hit one with dough . this love-in-an-attic is n't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon .
i do n't think you could have a real affair . you could n't care for anyone .
i do n't have any affairs . what do you mean ?
in the can . the hoosegow ! mrs. winton 's little boy . the pawk avenue wintons , you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi . he 's in the jail-house now ...
did you ? where ?
i met one last night ... all the money this side of peoria .
i do n't see any big-moneyed boys running after you .
i just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you did n't have the rent , but ralph is awful sweet .
what are you laughing at ?
i wish you would n't be so sarcastic about ralph . he 's the sweetest kid i know .
i wondered . did he invite you to lunch , or did you invite him ?
yes , why ?
i 'm glad you told me . good night , mr. burton .
that 's the way i feel about it .
so that 's the way it is ?
well , that 's just how stupid i am . when you go riding , it will be with me . and if it 's with someone else , you can make it a permanent arrangement .
i 'd call it stupid at any time .
you would n't have said that before you met her .
i 'm not quarreling , only ...
are we going to have the same quarrel over again ?
do n't kid yourself -- she means it .
she thinks it 's funny to talk the way she does , but --
well , i do say it .
i wo n't let you say that !
what 's nice about her ? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger .
nonsense . she 's one of the nicest girls i know .
she is n't anybody 's friend , and i do n't like you living with her . she 's a bad influence .
but why ? she 's the best friend i 've got .
delighted , i 'm sure .
why , certainly , sir . my fiance . charlotte , may i present mr. igor .
well , you see , the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule . all of his advertising announced the opening tonight .
disappoint me ? why , what do you mean , dear ?
and i have no desire to hurt you . you will always be beautiful . think , my child , in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now .
please , oh , please , i have n't done anything to hurt you .
ralph ! ralph !
we have found immortality , you and i. you must not be afraid .
let me go ! let me go !
it is no trouble at all , my child . this is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create . my footing is not too secure .
oh , please , mr. igor , i 'm terribly ashamed . i should n't have put you to so much trouble .
i 'd love to .
and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you . let him think it was his fault ... he should be along very shortly .. . but be very stern before you forgive him , especially if it is your fault ... while you 're waiting for your friend , would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs ?
but it was really my fault .
oh , you children , you happy children . you 've quarreled and now you 're going to be friends again . and that is as it should be . never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you .
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind .
oh ! so , my little friend , you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night .
oh ! mr. igor ! -- i 'm so glad you 're here -- i do n't know why i should be , but i was a little bit afraid .
they are . my boy , i think you are right . everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country , i am beginning to realize that i am a little tired myself . you can call that fellow in from the front . i think we 'll close for the night .
but i think these things are beautiful .
at any time . you will always be welcome .
we 'll be coming to the opening .
i 'd love to , at any time .
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born . before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... i made a very beautiful statue . even if i had not met with this disaster , i could never have hoped to do anything finer , probably nothing quite so fine . and , my child , you are that figure come to life . i wonder , some time , would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work ?
thank you .
if you will forgive this poor , crippled stump , my dear , i am very happy to know you .
nothing doing . this is my percentage . you birds are going to get yours . and anyhow , i found this dump .
hey , what do you think you 're doing ? put that stuff back !
i do n't know what he was , but he made frankenstein look like a lily !
you mean he was colored ?
not a very good one , i guess . he was n't like anything human . he hobbled and swayed like a monkey , and the face , from the glimpse i got of it in the light from the street , was like an african war mask .
how quaint . but i can go any place you can .
it happens that i 'm the law .
whatever you are , you 're the only one of it .
what do you think i am ?
listen , copper , get a load of this . while you 're chinning yourself on a bar rail , i run down this story ... my story . consider yourself my assistant .
do n't take my word for it . get down there yourself and give a look .
are you giving me this straight ?
i 'm not kidding . joan gale 's body is packed in the box in the basement , and i saw the most horrible thing down there .
hello , express . what 's the idea , trying to outsmart the police ?
the body of joan gale !
what ! what are you talking about ?
i 'm going to get even with you , you dirty stiff ! i 'll do it !
that 's what i said .
yes , you could . cut out this rotten business and act like a lady . marry me .
listen , stupid , could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval ?
i 'm going to make you eat dirt , you soap bubble ! i 'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go !
what goofy idea have you got now ? do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body .
was there any art on judge ramsey ?
go on , little girl , take your troubles somewhere else . i do n't feel like talking to you .
say , you 're always razzing everything i do , but this is one time i 'm in .
what do you mean -- haywire ? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers . you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games . you 're grand ! i 'm for you ! stupendous !
this one 's a story , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire .
you here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness ?
mit me , kid . i 've got a classic .
almost ! i 'll still bet i 'm right , and let you write your own ticket .
almost certain .
no kiddin ' ?
that dear , innocent judge ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in south america .
what do you mean ?
oh , by the way , another pet theory of yours just blew up .
all right , master mind . but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is .
come down to earth . do you think they would dare do anything like that ? do n't you think they 'd know that figure would be recognized ? shake your head real hard -- you 'll be all right .
let it go .
work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it .
and it came to life and divorced you . i know all about that . now my idea is this : somebody swipes the girl 's body , takes impression , makes a mold , produces wax figure ... bingo ! ... peddles it to this old skate down there !
i used to be married to one .
listen , jo-jo . does this mean anything to you ? joan gale 's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ?
about the gale girl , i mean . where do we go from there ? what of it ?
what !
we 'll grant that .
just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they have n't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line-up , then i 'm crazy .
no kiddin ' . what 's your idea ?
all right , you poor baboon , you can guess the rest of it !
well , you ca n't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that .
i asked you to keep your trap shut !
now do n't that call for an extra !
jim , there 's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th street .
all right , wise guy . go ahead . spill it .
listen , jim -- and if you wisecrack while i 'm talking i 'll crown you with the inkwell .
well , no one would ever suspect it . you do n't sound right .
i am right ! i know i 'm right !
so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong . do n't be sil , kid .
well , why so mysterious ! come on , spill it .
hey , mattie , dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on joan gale .
i want to see the original pictures of joan gale .
come in , prussic acid . what 's on your mind ?
get out of here .
which one is me ? the horse ?
sleep on it ... we 'll get it tomorrow .
no , there 's another point i want to iron out .
great ! ... if he 's worthless we 'll give him away as a bridge prize . come on -- beat it . it 's five o'clock . you need some sleep .
on the square , jimmy , if you 'd seen winton down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup , but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
nope , i 'm through !
hey , come here , sob-sister !
all right , you said i was fired . well , i quit ! give the assignment to somebody else .
you can not . i 'm still editor of this sheet .
well , that 's got nothing to do with this case . can i handle this my way ?
whooey -- he took a run-out powder .
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him .
except that he disappeared when things got too hot .
and they never proved anything against him .
oh , you wo n't -- you were pretty tough about judge ramsey -- a little while ago --
well , i wo n't work on it from that angle .
you do n't think he 'd be sap enough to do the job himself . i hope they give him the works . even if he did n't kill the kid , he 's responsible for her death , and they can fry him any time without making me sore .
well , anyway , he could n't have copped that body -- he was in jail .
i 'm glad to hear it . when did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice ? this lousy mug , with all the money in the world , has had two or three nasty affairs . he 's kept out o ' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the indians .
you give me a pain !
he 's getting a break , ai n't he ? he 's front page .
no , i mean it . i think this kid 's entitled to a break .
and ruin a perfectly good story ? do n't be silly .
i would n't be trying , beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing , all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ?
why the goose pimples ? if he was n't social register -- if it was somebody like me , you 'd be trying to hang him .
if this kid was some unknown soda jerker , they would n't have pinched him . but he 's george winton and they 're playing him up . it 's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york .
well , ai n't that a shame . nice little chappie that would n't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow .
quick , watson , the cookbook !
that is none of our business . but you bring me something for the next edition if it 's only a recipe for spaghetti !
and how does one go about getting these human documents , may i inquire ?
well , is it my fault if nothing happens ?
all right , what about it ? we get out a paper just the same . did you ever stop to think of that ?
what do you mean , you poor ham ! this is new year 's !
i 'm through clowning . you 're all washed up . get out !
that you 're a sure bet to place in the bread line . there 's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental . you 're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it .
meaning what ?
great . consider yourself crippled -- financially . see if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on .
charming . more delightful people crippled .
yeah . have a pleasant vacation ?
where did you get the news item ? from a little bird ?
been doing experiments with scotch and soda again ?
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince .
well , maybe it was . i do n't remember . you got to do something for me , i ca n't stand it any longer -- i ca n't !
you used to go to worth 's place a whole lot . what makes you sure it was n't there ?
no , sir , i 'm sure it was n't there .
you did n't happen to be going to worth 's place , did you ?
no , sir . about three months ago .
do n't remember what day that was , do you ?
i do n't remember . not so very far --
where were you going when you got in that cab ?
yes , sir . i got in the cab and it was layin ' there on the floor .
thanks .
it 's all yours .
do n't give this to anybody else , will you ?
there 's an autopsy ordered at bellevue immediately . you better skip over there .
make it snappy , colonel .
hotcha ! saved , one job !
nothing . only she may have tried to blackmail him . you know such things have happened . anyway , he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead .
what does that prove ?
why would i string y ' ? they were sweeties until a month ago .
say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ...
do n't they ? he 's down at the tombs right now .
they do n't suspect < i > him < /i > ?
that 's the one .
old howard winton 's cub ?
do you know george winton ?
no foolin ' -- any suspect ?
oh , yeah ? maybe she did n't commit suicide . she may have been murdered !
yes , she committed suicide yesterday . that 's not news . i heard about it last year .
i 've got a story for you . you know the joan gale girl ?
i 've got to make news , if i have to bite a dog . hey , kelly ! oh , mi gosh , even he walked out on me .
no kiddin ' .
i 'm people which the old year saw out . i 'm canned , fired !
fine . you 're the first reporter in here for two hours . you people seeing the old year out ?
how 's every little thing ?
call the homicide squad !
here 's a wow .
stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner 's banquet , and he says , bring me a yarn . all i have to do is get a story .
i told you he was a sore .
ai n't that something . the mad monk of manhattan . here goes nothing . listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion .
listen , flo , cut it out . hard-tack is pretty sore .
plain-clothes man . come on , slaves , drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death .
what do you mean police dog ?
he 's not a stag hound . his name is kelly and he 's a police dog .
where 'd you get the stag hound ?
better cut that out . that 's what happens to girls who bite their nails . what 's wrong ?
ralph , come here a minute , will you ?
no . i wanted to do it without saying anything . i think he 's worth it .
gee , that 's great . after the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue . this will pep him up . have you told him about it ?
well , i 'll tell you a secret . i kinda like the old gent and i 'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him . it might help him a whole lot . but that 's a side issue -- something i do on my own time .
i guess so . but would n't it be better for you to wait until the old man 's here ?
i 'm after news , as usual . i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory ?
what are you people doing out in the middle of the night ?
horsefeathers !
nix , flo -- he wo n't let you in and you 'll only get me in dutch .
who ? old santa claus there ? that 's easy for anyone with my sex appeal . he 's a pushover . watch me stand that old dodo on his ear .
no use . he 's a crab , i tell you .
he might get some publicity out of it .
do n't worry -- she 'll get used to it .
gee , honey-bunch , i 'm sorry -- i 'm going to have to disappoint you .
fine , thanks .
do n't ask any questions . come on !
what is it ? what happened ?
well , that being the case , i 'll take it up with the board of directors . hey , listen , aviator , here we are !
heaven knows . a lot .
how much money have you got ?
you do n't believe me . you think i 'm just talking . will you marry me ?
oh , is that what caused it ?
no , really -- i 'm crazy about you .
it does n't usually take that long , but i 'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you .
i suppose this is going to sound absurd . i 've only known you twenty-four hours , but i 'm in love with you .
-- and so determined to live that i 'm going to get out and take a taxi if you do n't watch where you 're going .
darned if i do n't !
you go in for dangerous things .
why ?
no -- no -- i -- i -- i do n't want to see it .
there she is ! you 'll find joan gale in that box .
i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place .
please . i 'm sorry . i 'll see it through . what do you want me to do ?
all right , brother . then you can go to some nice warm place , and i do n't mean california .
i told you i did n't want to mix in it .
what ! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story ? not so you could notice it ! now , look , i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me .
not even then . the police are the proper people to conduct this affair . now if you 've got any suspicions i 'll drive you to the nearest police station .
not even if it gives you a clean bill of health ?
now look here . it 's not up to us to do our own detective work . i 've had enough trouble over this matter . i do n't want anything more to do with it .
that 's what they 're going to ask you .
who 'd steal her body ?
that happens to be the truth .
then why are you telling me a crazy lie ? ...
hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .
stolen ! what are you trying to do to me ? ... you 're working with the police ! ... you 're trying to make me say something that can be used against me ! you 're trying ...
well , let 's get back to the case in hand . they ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue .
no . why did n't i take her out somewhere ? but she was laughing and seemed so happy .
you were n't going with her ?
we planned a trip for her . i was going to send her to bermuda .
i see . was that all she said ?
she laughed and told me that we were being silly , that we did n't care for each other any more but we need n't hate each other ... ... she said she wanted to be friends .
uh-huh . do you remember what she said ? what did you talk about ?
they did n't give me a chance . we had a couple of drinks and she was all right then . she seemed happy .
hmmm . why did n't you tell that to the police ?
for a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
your dad has stood for plenty . now let 's get down to cases . when did you see the dale girl last ?
my lawyers will be on the job in a little while , and i warn you people anything you print about me you 've got to prove . dad wo n't stand for --
that 's what i said .
cry-baby ?
listen , kid . you 're in a tough spot , and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
yes , sure , that 's fine . while i 'm proving my innocence , you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick i ever did ... you 're going to write editorials about every cocktail i ever drank . anything that any sane , normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning , if i did it . go on ! get out ! i do n't want to talk to you !
come on , old man , that wo n't do . you know you 're innocent until proven guilty .
yeah . i suppose you people will crucify me for something i did n't do . i did n't ! you understand that ! ... i did n't do it ! she -- tried before --
good night . and i am very grateful to you .
good night , sir .
it will always afford me great pleasure to see you .
i regret i ca n't spend the time i 'd like with your exhibition , but i 'm going to worry the life out of you when i come back .
you will have won the undying gratitude of us all . is that not so , marie antoinette ?
she will undoubtedly keep her promise . if you 'll grant me the privilege , i 'd like to submit this work to the royal academy when i get back .
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber , immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london . at such times marie antoinette has reassured me , she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her .
even those delicate veins , the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite .
you are too gracious . these things have some merit , i suspect ... but this -- ... i am convinced , is fine .
not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done .
you 're insane .
well , what do you think i 'm in this for ? think of it , man , a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us !
and they are welcome to them . to perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes .
you 've got to permit it ! whose fault is it that no one comes here ? the museum at walston lane does well enough , and why ? they 've got jack the ripper , burke and hare , the mad butcher , the demon barber of fleet street and things people pay to see .
and you think i will permit this , my friend ?
i 'm not asking you anything . i 'm telling you what i 'm going to do !
you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking ? ...
i want the money back i 've thrown into this rubbish heap .
a fire ! is this your idea of humor , my friend ?
yes , there 's our way out . a fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds .
fire insurance !
no -- i 'm lying to amuse myself ! now look here , i 've an idea that will get us out of all this . we have n't twopence between us , but we 've got these .
is that a fact ?
something important has got to come of it ! do you know that the rent on this place is n't paid ?
your money may have been well invested , my friend . something important may come of all this .
that is unfortunate .
i came back for some of the books . i am trying to straighten out the accounts . i do n't hope to impress you , but i may as well tell you : we have n't a farthing !
quite so . quite so . and you , my little friend , my little marie antoinette . it is kind of you to be present .
i would n't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight , mr. igor . the weather was against you , and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow .
all right , i 'll tell them . they 're right here in front .
if you leave before the work is done , you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good .
i will only be gone about half an hour .
that is unfortunate . they will have to wait .
but i have some friends waiting .
to lunch , you say . i am having coffee and sandwiches sent in . we are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening .
to lunch .
if it is freedom to represent people with limbs that do n't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose . anatomy ! heaven forgive you . you must have studied with a sideshow of freaks !
but the composition as a whole -- i 've tried to keep a sketchy freedom .
everything , my friend . and you hope to be a great sculptor -- a great sculptor . look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long .
that does n't seem so bad to me . what is wrong with it ?
and he is n't struck dead ! this man , he lives ! it would be interesting to know , young man , where and when you studied anatomy .
one of the maids-in-waiting for that elizabethan group .
if my curiosity is not too great , would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing ?
do n't lose sight of him . this is the most important thing in my life .
i 'd know him anywhere .
he ca n't hear you .
what are you laughing at ?
i wonder if i could have her pose for me .
she is the soul of that statue .
you have done well , and now i , too , have something for you . come .
i 'd be glad to , mr. igor . i think i 'll have somethin ' to tell you soon .
yes .
shall we unpack it ?
otto ! you and one of those other fellows ! come help professor darcey .
yes , sir , it 's here on the truck , but it 's pretty heavy -- i 'll need help .
have you got it ? is it completed ?
thanks .
well , any time i can do anything for you --
they did n't have a leg to stand on . there 's no case against me . it 's a clumsy thing to have happen , but nothing to worry about .
i 'm glad they did n't hold you downtown .
good . well , i 'll be seeing you .
yep . everything settled .
yes ... .
mia ... ?
what was her name ? the one i met .
excuse me ? ? ?
what was her name ?
-- what if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor ? what then ? what did your life mean ? who did you nurture , pauly ? who did you love ?
you did miss --
spare me your classical answer . measurements in . results taken . what if i did n't miss ?
you did .
two : what if i did n't miss ?
dad ...
do n't waste it pauly . this is not an everyday talk . just input the information and ask relevant questions . one : how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particular switching station ?
you taking any medication ?
to isolation . to an armed camp . to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son .
so i can move on . you too .
why ?
what ?
then you get it . you 'll understand .
i 've been dreaming about this .
wait . i want to tell you something .
i did n't want to leave things the way we did . not this time .
and glow happily ever after .
that they tunnel , magically , through any obstacle , defying the practical laws of physics , in order to end up together --
dysfunctional --
a five hundred foot thick steel wall . but the connection between these two electrons is so --
she 's in l.a. , he 's in the bay area --
inside every semi-conductor ... you have two particles , with opposite charges , separated by an impassable barrier ...
no . i did n't . i 'm listening .
like now ?
that 's what it asked me . `` what do you want ? '' i did n't answer . i was in the middle of an experiment .
what did it want ?
god . i dunno . the eternal nothingness . mia .
of what ?
how ?
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium .
nothing is real until it 's perceived .
a quantum one .
what universe are you in , paul ?
could be .
at the sub-atomic level , particles obey their own logic . they connect in unimaginable ways .
we flopped the first time out .
it 's an experiment .
why am i doing this ?
that 's the physicist 's playground .
a place you 've never been .
where to ?
could you ?
i could go out of town .
what ?
okay .
i 'm heading out of town .
could we go somewhere ?
day or night ?
i 've been dreaming about you .
i said she is n't here . now you go home . be a nice boy and go home .
where is she ?
she is n't here . and i 'm sorry , but mr. hillyer does n't want her to have callers during working hours .
well , i got to see her .
she must have gone out for a walk with the children .
is rose here ?
yes ?
this is n't punishment , i do n't believe in punishment . it 's for your health . obviously you 're sick if you can act like that .
oh , mother , not the castor oil .
i do n't think you are sufficiently in awe of it . get the castor oil .
i am in awe of it , mother .
but we must respect that power , we must be in awe of it .
i know , mother .
sex is n't ugly , sex is one of the most beautiful things in life , the creative power of the universe is behind it .
they 're filthy , mother .
buddy , sex do n't mean a thing to me . it ai n't nothin ' but a mosquito bite . i 'll tell you a secret . girls do n't want sex , buddy , girls want love .
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy , rose .
a saint just like your own mother . she 's up in heaven right now , her and lunette , there ai n't no doubt about it .
what was your mother like ?
boy did i get sick of rabbit . but later on after momma died and daddy was n't doin ' nothin ' but drinkin ' , i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew . you know , i ought n't to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child . until them rabbits ruined him , he was a real good man , buddy .
well , that doctor said you got protein somewhere and i guess he was right .
he thought he could sell 'em , but nobody but country folks eat rabbits , buddy , and they ai n't got no money . we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves . every dern one , and it took about four years to eat 'em all up .
how did the rabbits kill him ?
yep , we had 'em in orange crates all over . it was daddy 's dream . he was goin ' to get rich raisin ' rabbits . it was what killed daddy . he did n't drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid , but it was them rabbits what killed him .
five hundred rabbits ?
did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits ?
they 're dumb things . i got tired of them .
i guess i 'll work as a waitress , buddy . i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know , but i ca n't stay here no more . why did you get rid of your rabbits , buddy ?
take a little walk with me , huh ?
what are you going to do , rose ?
makin ' homes for purple martins , huh ? we had 'em on the farm . they 're the prettiest things . that 's what i wish i was , a bird . just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun .
okay .
hi , buddy . how 's my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad ?
i do n't want to know ...
i got ta find out what they 're saying . you lie back and rest , rose , and i 'll give you a report on it .
buddy , i 'm scared , i 'm scared !
you wo n't die , rose .
oh , buddy , they 're gon na cut me all up ! they 're gon na cut my stummick all open , i 'll die !
i ai n't neither . listen here , buddy , besides all his vast medical knowledge , he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he 's got some real interestin ' ideas .
rose , you are just entirely too uncritical of people .
well , i like him . i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more . why , he could operate on me any old time and i would n't even be scared .
yeah , i 'd believe it .
he 's got doubts about hisself and that 's the saddest thing of all . would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him ?
rose , i have got doubts about that doctor and so does daddy .
yeah , he tried to hide it but i saw 'em , and a little bit he says to me , `` you know , you are beautiful . '' now was n't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient , was n't it ? what could cheer a girl up more ?
he did ?
you do n't know the bedside manner that man has got . why , it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin ' in his bag like he 's gon na cure me , which he did of course . and even more important he loves me , like a patient i mean , the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin ' to my heart beat .
rose , you are too uncritical of people .
oh , he 's so kind , so gentle inside , and so unhappy with that rich wife who does n't understand him , her being a southerner and everything , and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts !
but i do n't know who they are .
rose , if you do n't keep your boyfriends away from the house , daddy is going to fire you .
i got an awful toothache .
well , he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day . but i do n't know who he is , buddy , i really do n't .
rose , you must know who the fellow is .
you 're my sweetheart .
yeah .
did your momma really give you castor oil ?
i have a knack for designing clothes . but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook .
here comes daddy .
buddy , mr. right is out there somewhere and i 'm gon na find him !
you 're going to get yourself up and go out ?
well , ill tell you this . i have learned a lesson tonight . i was n't gon na run around , but when i start botherin ' your daddy and worse robbin ' a cradle , i got ta face the facts of life . tomorrow mornin ' , i 'm gon na get myself up and go out .
oh , buddy , you do love me ! i knew you did , knew it all the time ...
rose , they could stick splinters under my fingernails , and i will never say a word ! i will never tell them , because ... i love you !
buddy , i have to ask you , as bad as i 've been please have pity on me and do n't ruin me by telling them what i did . i know it was bad , it was bad and dumb . but mostly it was dumb , i did n't mean you no harm , i 'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that 's the truth . i love you . but they 'd think i did , they 'd think i was awful , they 'd despise me and hate me ...
i said i would n't .
i hate to turn on this light , you daddy 's awake downstairs , but i have to take the chance . buddy , please do n't tell on me .
good night , rose .
i sure hope you do n't . i got ta get outta here , good night .
do n't worry , rose , i wo n't tell a soul .
buddy , you would n't tell nobody , would you ?
no . no , i 'm all right . oh , god , what have i done ? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell ! i must be crazy , a child like you . oh , god , oh , lord . this is awful , this is terrible , i got ta get outta here !
rose , are you all right ? are you sick or something ?
you would n't understand . oh , god , i must be outta my mind . what would your momma think ?
but why , if i 'm not hurting you ?
no . no , you 're not hurting me . but i think you better quit it .
am i hurting you ?
i must be outta my mind . buddy , quit it .
but rose ...
you better quit that .
well , nothin ' .
i 'm thirteen . and i have a natural curiosity . it 's only nature , rose , that 's all . now what 's wrong with nature , huh ?
buddy , you 're just a child .
yes , i do . please , rose , be a good sport .
well , you 're sweet , but you do n't really love me .
please , rose . i 'm curious , that 's all , i have a natural curiosity , it 's only human . you 're my friend , are n't you ? do n't you like me ? i like you , rose , a lot -- in fact , i love you .
of course you ca n't ! i 'm ... i 'm shocked at you , buddy , real shocked ! now you be quiet or i 'm going back to my own bed !
ca n't i touch it a little , rose -- not a lot , just a little ?
no ! you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin ' such a nasty things a child your age !
yeah , but satisfaction brought him back . can i ?
well , now that is just too bad ! curiosity killed the cat .
i 'm curious to see what it 's like . i 'm very curious , rose .
why , buddy , shut your mouth ! what an awful thing to say , and where did you get any such idea as that , anyhow ?
rose , since you 're here in bed with me and everything and i 've already touched your titty ...
most men would n't do what he done . if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- i guess to hell they do , just like a dern rabbit . 'course later they 'll tell her she 's no good when they done the same thing their selves . they 're a bunch of monkeys . i like 'em , but they 're a bunch of monkeys .
rose , i have a serious favor to ask you .
there ai n't none in your daddy . you know , what happened has just made me love him all the more . i not only love him , i respect him , i admire him .
there 's an evil streak in everybody , rose .
you know , buddy , sometimes i ca n't figure you out at all . you can be very nice , but like your mother said there 's an evil streak in you .
well , some fiend might .
who would want to do such a thing as that ?
it was softer'n i thought , that was my main impression . you know , if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot .
do n't mention it .
that was very interesting . thank you , rose .
all right , that 's enough . you 're just a child and would n't understand it , but that type of thing can stir a girl up . now lie back and we 'll talk .
first i could n't feel it , but now i feel it easily , it 's like a little acorn .
'course it does .
hmmph . it has a nipple , all right .
well , are you satisfied now ? can we just lie and talk , huh ?
aw , be a good sport , rose . you like me , do n't you ? i like you a lot .
you don ' t need to know that . it 's none of your business .
aw , come on , rose , i want to see what the nipple on it is like .
buddy , you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice .
just for a second . please , rose , what 's the harm ?
but i 'm curious , rose .
buddy , what 's come over you ? a child like you , askin ' such things .
rose , ca n't i see what the nipple on it is like ?
no , you ca n't . and i 'll tell you this -- he scares me . as kind as he is , he scares me . you ca n't fool around with him , not with that man . and , boy , i sure better not try nothin ' like that with him again , he 'll fire me .
can i put my hand inside your nightgown , rose ?
you know , that daddy of yours is the funniest man , the things he says , you never know what 's going to come out of his mouth next .
actually , i am , though .
buddy , quit that , you 're just a child , you 're not supposed to be interested in such things .
there 's some kind of gristle in it , though .
ha ha ha , that 's some idea , a cantaloupe .
well , i thought they were more like a cantaloupe .
what did you expect ?
hmmm , it 's soft . it 's awful soft .
i fell madly in love with him when he called me rosebud . you know that first day when i come and he said i looked graceful like a capital letter s and called me rosebud ? i fell madly in love with that man right then . but it 's a lost love , buddy . he 's a good man and wo n't have nothin ' to do with me .
but , rose , how could such a thing as that happen ?
promise not to tell doll ? -- or nobody ? buddy , it 's your daddy ! i 'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind !
but , rose , what is the cause of it all ?
why , it has just made me ill , buddy . i 'm sick . i do n't want to eat nothin ' , i do n't , and me i got a good appetite , that ai n't nat'ral for me . i 'm ill .
you were pretty bad , huh ?
buddy , i was horrible . i ca n't tell you who it was , but do you know what i did ? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know , a child like you . why , i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers ... but to get back serious to what i was sayin ' , it is not only , buddy , the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so ...
what 'd you do , rose ?
it 's so terrible i ca n't tell you . oh , buddy , you do n't know how it hurts to have a broken heart , what a terrible feeling it is , and i 've had a broken heart so many times . men , i do n't understand them , i ca n't figure them out and they break my heart , that 's all . i ca n't find mr. right , buddy , i ca n't find him no matter how hard i look , all i find is a whole pile of mr. wrongs . but this is the worst ever because it was n't his fault . it was my fault , oh yes , my fault , i was bad -- oh god , i was bad , you would n't believe how bad i was .
what is it , rose ?
i thought i 'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to . as a child , i never had no room all to myself , we were awful poor . buddy ... i have got a confession to make .
well , all right .
buddy , i am wandering in a wilderness , lost . i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ?
no , i 'm awake . what 's the matter ?
buddy , you are in one of your evil moods , i do n't want to talk to you . i 'm going out and sweep the patio .
well , it 's only the truth . there are horrible things in the world , rose .
i do n't hear you . i just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away .
he really did , he ate his little niece . he made pork chops out of her .
i did n't hear you . i did n't hear that .
there was this old man that ate his niece .
what terrible thing in cave springs ?
hey , rose , did you hear about that terrible thing down in cave springs ?
your daddy is a wonderful man , i 'll say that . he 's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world .
was that what they tried to do ? was that why daddy gave you the job , to save you from those scoundrels ?
did they try to induce you to become a prostitute ?
bad is bad , buddy . there ai n't no sense to it .
in what sense were they bad ?
they were just bad men , that 's all .
but who were they ?
nobody .
rose , who were those scoundrels in birmingham ?
sure . let me take your suitcase .
buddy . well , now , that 's a nice name , i like it . i am real pleased to meet you . hey , look , do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere ?
lots of things . buddy , mostly .
oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
of course not !
quiet , you little muddy-eyed brat , or ill kill you !
he did lie , and ... and ... and mother , yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook !
rose is madly in love with daddy ...
all right , what do you know ?
i do , too !
oh , waski , you do n't know anything .
yeah , i know .
i do , too .
oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
neither do i .
no , she has n't . i think i hear a car .
i heard you talking . has n't rose come in ?
she 's got somebody in there , brother ! his shoes are on the back porch -- there they were , naked and smiling at me ! rose , open this door immediately !
daddy , what 's the matter ?
open that door , damn you !
and there 's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into rose 's bedroom in the dark of night ! i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it ! -- and that is not all i am going to do !
well ... maybe ...
see , son ? the paint is flaked off here , freshly . look at it , brother , there is no question about it . some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder .
true , but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder . now let 's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with .
well , i do n't know . no , i do n't know , daddy , i think the rain has obscured it .
well . well , what i mean is , you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him . but look this , brother , it is even more interesting . look at this mark here , and that mark over there . now would n't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder ?
but how would you find him ?
that is because it rained recently , the rain has obscured the evidence . but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints , then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are , and that way you could catch him -- understand ?
well , it 's not very plain .
see that , son ? now this is a heel , see , and there , that 's the ball of a foot . someone has been walking here .
he 's not coming back again . we scared the rascal off , son . come on back to supper . your mother has a theory about how to educate rose .
i do n't know . but you better watch him like a hawk , if he comes back again .
what do you think , brother ?
what 's taking the rascal so long ?
yeah , he 's still up there .
is that doctor still up there , brother .
the girl strikes like a cobra .
i do n't know .
i never saw anything like it . how did she pick him up so fast ?
no . why should rose be in my room ?
son , was rose in your room last night ?
well , yeah .
reading dirty comic bocks . and you admitted it ?
well , a little .
you were up late last night , brother .
i 'll be right back .
now i have a plan about rose , an educational plan . she 's getting better and we do n't want any more trouble -- brother , you ought to hear this .
excuse me , got ta go to bathroom .
i do wish you 'd speak to brother . it 's true he 's been looking at those horrible little books again .
heh , what a hypocrite .
oh , yes , it 's thursday . hello , rose , dear ... ... my , you 're ... looking pretty ...
she 's getting herself up to go out . i think she 's coming down the hall now .
what 'd you say , brother ?
she 's getting herself up to go out .
children , children ! be quiet , all of you ! the vibrations in this house are strange today . where 's rose , anyhow ?
yes , i did , mother . your hearing aid is n't working right . i said ahhh-dam stuff .
no , you did n't say that , brother .
i said ahhh-dam stuff .
what did you say , brother ?
uhhh , gahdam stuff !
stop gagging like that and putting on a show , and swallow it .
geccch , yehh , guhhhh !
this is for your own good . when you look at negative , destructive things like those little filthy comic books , you are sick . here , take this .
mother , cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil ?
oh , brother , i am so disappointed in you . you must n't look at those horrible things , they degrade the human image .
mother , i have to tell the truth . i was n't reading huckleberry finn , i was reading one of those little dirty comic books .
brother , when i have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you 're either sick or you were up very late last night . and you were n't reading huckleberry finn . i looked and its not in your room . now what were you doing ?
walked , in all that heat ? it 's a wonder she has n't got sunstroke . i 'll phone daddy and you go get doll baby and waski .
in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville . she walked out here , she did n't go by the hotel .
all right , all right . doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap , you go get them and bring them down to the living room . where is the girl ?
you mean confirmed , mother . i did n't confirm it before . i would have had to confirm it previously , in order for it to be reconfirmed .
your impression is very reassuring , brother . of course she 's had troubles , poor thing , but i sensed that was that the girl was like and i 'm glad to have it reconfirmed .
she talks a great deal and smiles a lot . she 's very pretty , she has a real good figure . she 's very girlish or womanish , if you know what i mean . she would n't hurt anybody , this girl . she could n't .
wonderful . what 's she like , brother ? what is your impression of her ?
the new girl is here .
here comes daddy .
why is it taking so long ?
if it is n't a baby ... what is it ?
that 's the least of her troubles . rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up , she told me all about it .
a baby ... and she is n't even married .
rose says she 's goin ' to have a baby and she sure looks it , but i do n't think so .
what 's goin ' on ?
sense does n't mean anything to rose . but i think we 're on safe ground now . daddy chained up the ladder , whoever it is ca n't get in the house .
well , if she 's got any sense at all , she 'll listen to that .
doll , do n't ask childish questions .
buddy ... does rose really ... `` do it '' with all those boys and men ?
mother is struggling desperately . in fact she 's fighting like a tiger . but i do n't know , it 's close , it 's mighty close .
what 's happening ?
you better not snoop , daddy 'll kill you !
they 've been in there the longest kind of time . i ca n't stand it , i got ta find out what 's going on .
what is rose going to do ? where can she go ?
dumbness does n't concern her , doll . and neither does smartness . you see --
then why does she act so dumb ?
it is n't that she has n't got any sense , doll . her basic intelligence is probably above average , maybe quite a bit above average .
she has n't got any sense . in some ways , she 's awful dumb .
so am i .
buddy , i 'm worried about rose .
chattanooga . i had st. louis , missouri .
shut up , doll . i 'll cut your guts
no , mother , he 's lying ...
you know , buddy , sometimes you make me sick .
wonderful ? he kissed her and played with her titty , and i do n't see anything so great about that . he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him .
was n't daddy wonderful ? he wanted to kiss her some more and play with her , but he did n't , because he loves mother and all of us , and he loves rose , too . is n't he wonderful , is n't he great ?
you should n't watch such things , doll .
buddy , that was pretty snotty of you , pushing me away like that just when it was interesting .
buddy , that was my place .
she 's putting the titty back .
let me look . aww-rr ...
he had his hand on her titty .
is that all ?
he kissed her .
what are they doing , doll ?
buddy , this is amazing , you would n't believe it .
what are they doing ?
wow ! brrrother !
boy ! wow !
now i ca n't see . what are they doing ?
let me see !
he 's trying to get up -- good god , one of her titties is out !
ohhh-hh ... what 's happening now ?
this is my place and you ca n't have it .
i ca n't see , let me see ...
they 're discussing it .
i ca n't see . what are they doing , what 's happening ?
at least .
i think she 's gon na kiss him .
okay .
let 's go peep from the living room .
yeah .
there goes mother .
i get so irritated with daddy . he 's so dumb sometimes .
yeah .
she 's watching the car again ?
it 's really pitiful . she 's in bad shape .
no , he does n't . not really .
i think daddy suspects .
it 's pitiful . neither one of them know .
no .
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce . do you believe that , doll ?
oh , shut up , buddy .
rose is almost as sentimental as mother . if there 's one thing i ca n't stand it 's sentimentality . in chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder . he killed his wife with a black widow spider .
i 'm not blubbering .
now look , boy , get a grip on yourself . rose had a good life . she found her . right , did n't she ? she triumphed over everything , what are you blubbering about ?
that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?
nobody lives forever , boy . who 'd want to ?
why rose ? why rose , daddy ?
it 's true , son . the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead , she is no more ,
i ca n't believe it , daddy . i know it must be true , but i ca n't believe it .
i know . you loved her . so did i. it was an awful shock to me , too . an awful shock . rose was so alive it 's hard to believe .
well , you have knocked me for a hell of a loop , old man . a hell of a loop .
excuse me , i 'll be right back .
she was fifty-six , son . of course she did n't look it , nowhere near it . the cancer came back , i 'm afraid i fibbed about that . but it was very quick , son . she was in the hospital only two weeks , and the last week she did n't know anything .
but ... but how ? she was young ! rose was n't old !
i am afraid so , son . about a week ago . her husband phoned me , she had asked him to call me if anything happened .
dead , rose is dead ? you mean ... she died ?
no , son , she is dead .
all right , daddy . we have our drink , we 're out on the patio , you have prepared me for it . rose 's cancer has come back , has n't it ?
i 'm older than hell , boy . but this yankee whisky is mighty fine , i 'll say that .
it 's funny you would mention rose , i was thinking about her all the way up in the car . or maybe it is n't so funny .
not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .
it always gives me a funny feeling to come home . dear old southland . gone . it 's all gone , daddy -- -- except you , you 're still here .
a wonderful woman , boy .
that 's what she would say herself .
at rest in the creative universe with mother , son .
you know , i do n't know this town any more . all this traffic , new buildings , prosperity ... where have the years gone , daddy ? where is the little town i knew as a boy ?
yes , i guess he did . he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life .
he did n't lose her , he threw her away .
yeah , i know , he was up here . it 's pitiful like you say . when he lost rose it ruined the man , it destroyed him totally when he lost rose .
you 're damn right it incensed me , the miserable bastard . he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington . d.c .
um-hmm , and i suppose that incensed you ?
the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac .
no , it 's another thing . i was going to write you about it , but since you were coming down anyway i thought i 'd wait till you got here . what did dave wilkie have to say ?
is her husband sick or something ?
oh , no , no , she got all over that . rose is fine . let 's sit down , son .
what sad news ? did her cancer come back ?
oh , i heard from her , i got a letter from her , she 's fine . but there is some sad news .
what 's all this about rose ? what do you mean , you heard from her in a manner of speaking ?
dave wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband . it 's funny you would mention rose . did you hear from her ?
how could that be , son ?
of course i recall rose . in fact i 've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half .
got another twenty years in it , boy . by the way , son , do you recall rose , that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion .
good god , the way you live here . this place has n't been dusted since mother died . look at that goddamned refrigerator .
are they polar bears , too ?
yeah , they 're in the snow .
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow ?
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had .
it 's yankee whisky to me .
it is n't yankee whisky , daddy , it 's scotch .
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave . good to see you , son . did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you ?
hello , daddy . how are you ?
well , you rascal , where 'd you come from ?
yes , we know her .
i think we both know her .
of course .
i have of course observed the girl in treating her .
please do .
then ... may i speak quite frankly with you , mr. hillyer ?
i am ahead of you .
go on , doctor .
first , about the girl 's history . evidently she 's been very promiscuous since early childhood , she has no control over her sexual impulses . furthermore , she is permanently barren , she ca n't have children .
go ahead , doctor , i think i am following you .
oh , it 's definitely better , beyond question . a fatherless child , an ignorant girl with no job , no money , no home . it 's fortunate , a blessing really , and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you .
well , if it is n't malignant and she can get through the operation all right , it might be better than her really being pregnant . she does n't even know who the father might have been .
any major operation is dangerous . however , as we know from her previous illness , she 's a very strong girl .
well , it 's a disaster . i do n't know what to say , doctor , i am floored . how dangerous is the operation ?
that 's all i want to know . lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself . thank you , doctor , for your discourse , it was fascinating , no doubt .
the point is you do n't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits . she got protein somewhere , she 's a very strong girl and i think she 'll live ... despite the delay in medical treatment .
yes , i think so . he adores her , it 's almost pitiful the way he worships her . i just hope she is n't too much for him .
honey , he is mr. right .
well , yes , she 's happy . of course dave does n't have her life force , not at all . there is n't much furniture in his house , just a table and one or two chairs , whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows .
well , thank god we are rid of her at last . and the best thing of all is that she 's happy . the little nut is happy , she found mr. right in the nick of time !
you know dave , his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died .
who ?
why , that looks like dave wilkie ,
i 'm afraid it 's my fault . i made her feel guilty this morning -- brother , what are you doing up ?
i do n't understand it . even in the wild days she was never as late as this .
it 's twenty after one .
fine .
how is she ?
better off ? how could she ever find love and happiness , if you did what you 're talking about ? are you insane ?
well , i know , more so . that 's why i was thinking ... maybe she 'd be better off .
rose is n't oversexed , that 's ridiculous . if you 're going to talk nonsense , i do n't want to talk to you at all . rose is exactly the same as the rest of us , except more so .
well , i ... i had n't thought about it that much . i was thinking ... well , it 's an idea , the girl is oversexed , and ...
i ca n't believe you really meant it , if i did i 'd want to die . you are n't a male monster , that man is but you are n't . look me in the eye and tell me , do you really want to take rose 's womanhood away from her when it 's all she has got ?
well , now , darlin ' ... give me a chance to defend myself .
i thought i knew you . i thought i knew you better , i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man . well , i ca n't believe what i 've just heard in this room . a defenseless girl depending on you for protection , and you propose to mutilate and destroy her . how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man ?
over ... my ... dead ... body !
reluctantly , i do . it would be a blessing to her and everyone else . the girl is oversexed and i say -- spay her !
honey , that 's no way to talk to the doctor , he 's merely doing his job , dear .
this conversation is making me a little sick .
i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition . i wash my hands or the whole thing .
i 'd say about three months . are you satisfied ?
she does n't have to take her panties off , we can see her stomach with 'em on . all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly .
honey !
i forgot that rose will lie like a child . she 's no more pregnant than i am , she just does n't want to go to that farm !
what did you forget ?
ah , ha ! hold the phone ! no forwarding address , huh ? in the shock of this brilliant move , i forgot something .
but she must know ... unless ... unless ... rose , was there more than one person ?
she already told you , she does n't know .
that 's why i 'm asking her who the father is . it 's the most vital question of all . who 's the father , dear ?
you 're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning . the problem is , what are we going to do ?
poor thing , do n't cry , rose . i know you feel awful , but do n't cry , honey , nobody 's perfect . who 's the father , dear ?
this is a total catastrastroke . as of this moment i am stumped , i admit , i am stumped and treed both , the hound dogs have me surrounded .
trickery and flummery or not , she 's going there tomorrow on the bus ! it 's settled ! and i must say we 've been more than fair to you , rose , it 's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that !
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that 's just trickery and flummery .
i do n't give a hoot in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she ca n't stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it !
i do n't know how you can call it ideal -- do n't you know what the word `` farm '' means to her ?
just a minute , rose , you do n't understand . this is n't a dirt farm like the one you were born on , it 's nice . a neighbor of cousin hop 's , i talked to him on the phone , a fine man ... it 's not a farm , damn it , it 's a beautiful dairy establishment ! stop crying , rose ! do you hear me ? stop crying , it 's ideal !
honey , rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life . now i do n't think --
something has got to be done or rose is going to be in this house forever .
she 's just nervous and worried . and you would be , too , if you had no job and no place to go .
her plan is obvious , plain as day . she 's going on a hunger strike . the question is , how do we foil her ?
no , she does n't , she 's fine , fine . she 's perfectly healthy , do n't give her ideas .
she does look a little peaky .
the hell we ca n't .
she ca n't get a job , it 's a depression . and we ca n't just throw her out on the street .
it has been three weeks since i `` fired '' her . is there no way to get rid of this girl ? are we stuck with her for life ?
just a moment , dear . we ca n't have it , rose . can you behave yourself -- or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question . if you ca n't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?
she has n't actually done anything ...
um-hmm . come with me , brother . i want to show you something .
she 's like a different person . being so sick made a big impression on her . i really think she 's learned a lesson .
sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit . your real trouble is that you 're anti-intellectual . the irony is women are supposed to be emotional , but i never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do .
i do n't care where the polecat studied .
honey , dr. martinson is n't a rascal , he 's one of the finest physicians in glenville . he studied at johns hopkins university .
i do n't see how you can even think of it now .
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed . i hope she 'll be all right , but i still think we ought to fire her .
he 's a polecat , dear .
you do n't like him because he 's a yankee . he 's a brilliant doctor .
i ca n't stand that polecat . they ought to hang him .
honey , please ...
excuse me , sir , are you calling my wife a liar ?
i 'll talk to her , i 'll reason with her .
darlin ' , rose has got to go !
what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people . she 's young , she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her . its creative , but in her case it 's too creative .
they follow her because she 's a -- -- no , i wo n't say that .
if you mean sex , you could n't be more wrong . rose likes those boys and men , she has love in her heart , and that is what they want . it 's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her .
well , i have a pretty good idea .
how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly ? she has a loving nature , you ought to want someone like that around your children . why do you think those boys and men like her ?
but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else , i see more deeply into it ...
now look , darlin ' , this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension .
but morals come from the heart , not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore , she 's not immoral . not really .
that is exactly what i 'm afraid of . the girl has got to go , darlin ' .
who is to say our morals are better than hers ? but maybe you 're right . she could ... influence dolly ...
it 's because of the children she 's got to go . i do n't want to be holier-than-thou , but the girl does n't have the same outlook we do . morals do n't mean a thing to her , not a thing , and we ca n't have a girl like that in this house .
well , she does seem to cause a lot of trouble , i admit . but she does n't mean any harm and it 'll break the children 's hearts , they all love her .
i 'm sorry , darlin ' , i hate it as much as you do .
well , that 's very reasonable . howe i hate to bring it up , but she 's got an awful toothache , we 've got to carry her to the dentist .
i said i do n't intend to fire her . i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth , that 's all .
it is n't her fault if she 's popular ... what ?
i do n't intend to fire her , darlin ' .
just a moment ! you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends , not while there is breath in my body !
now you listen to me , rose --
i do n't intend to mock you , dear . i respect your philosophy . it 's beyond my comprehension , but i respect it .
and when i try to talk to you seriously , when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life , how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts , what do you do -- you mock me !
now darlin ' , what has the south got to do with this ?
yes ! yes , i say that to you , they were boys ! boy friends of rose , chat 's what they were , and why should n't she have boy friends ? do you want her to be unnatural ? do n't you think she 's human the same way you are yourself ? it 's the south , that 's what it is , the south with its horrible traditions , of slavery and crime and the oppression of women , who are just as good as men and just as human !
boys ? you say to me boys ?
scoundrels ? they were n't scoundrels , they were just boys .
-- i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics . now listen to me . when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
darlin ' , it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
you certainly are ! she has an awful toothache , look at her jaw , it 's all swollen .
i am not being brutal to her !
i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl .
oh , shut up , rose . shut your mouth and quit crying !
rose , i realize you do n't know this boy , but if you know anybody who does know him , if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be , then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife ... and i do n't mean maybe .
well , it is n't rose 's fault boys and men like her . you cant blame her for that , hon .
rose , my patience is wearing thin . first a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away . this is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show .
that sulky boy was here again this afternoon . i was almost scared , he would n't go away .
yes , darlin ' , time will tell .
well , time will tell , wo n't it ?
forgive my crudity , darlin ' . all i 'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later .
well , i wish you 'd stop criticizing and picking on her .
no reason at all , darlin ' .
why should n't she go out and have boyfriends ?
i do n't see any bruises or broken bones .
is she all right ?
quarter of twelve .
what time is it ?
well , she 's back .
yes , of course .
be kind to her . she loves you so much . in a perfectly proper way , of course .
you are the one who 's good-hearted . as for rose , let 's hope for the best .
but that 's a wonderful quality , not a bad quality . have a little patience with her . she 's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard .
well , she loves children , all right . she loves everybody .
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children .
that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her , and i 'm beginning to see why .
i do n't think you understand her . it is n't sex she wants , it 's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it .
she will succeed .
well , i admit that outfit is n't very modest . but she does n't mean any harm , she just wants to attract , attention .
the girl worries me . if she walks down the street like that , an army will be following her .
i wish you would n't pick on rose and tease her like that . of course her clothes are silly , but she 's ignorant , naive , she does n't know any better .
rose , you and brother wait in the car . i want to speak for a moment lo mr. hillyer .
just half-a-cup of coffee . i never eat , darlin ' , you know that . not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses . let 's go , rose , you and brother , let 's hit the road .
you 're not having lunch ?
who does n't have such thoughts ? we 'd better get going .
well , it is a little tight . but it is n't as bad as all that . no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place .
they 'll put her in jail . the damn little fool might as well be naked .
i 'll take him with me downtown . and you , too , rose , if you want a ride .
i 'm serious . we forget he 's just a child . i wish you 'd speak to him .
lay off of that stuff , son . it upsets your mother .
why , they wo n't either . she looks pretty . and i wish you would n't pick on the poor girl all the time . do n't listen to him , rose , you look pretty , even beautiful .
um-hmm . well , that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life . you walk down the street like that and they 'll put you in jail , rose .
no , darlin ' . just that damnable insomnia in reverse . i sleep like a baby for an hour then i 'm wide awake . you go back to sleep .
what 's the matter , hon ? is anything wrong ?
all right , darlin ' .
i think about what i 'm doing all the time , and i 've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody . besides , i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes , the poor girl is n't feeling well .
i 'll drive you , darlin ' . you 've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile . you do n't think about what you 're doing and you 'll run into a telephone pole .
you 're a wonderful woman , darlin ' . as long as you 're around , i 'm sure the sun would n't dare go out .
be nice to rose . she 's never had a real home .
forgive my crudity , darlin ' . i do n't understand these deeper things the way you do .
i 'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension , when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control . as blake said , if god had doubt the sun would go out .
all right , darlin ' , do n't go off into the fourth dimension .
hotcha character . if i had to live with your cynicism , i would n't want to live at all . what you ca n't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive , not negative .
i love rosebud , i am wild about rosebud . i just hope she does n't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character , that 's all . we have growing children in the house .
hope for the best ? i do n't understand all this skepticism . i thought you liked rose .
well , let 's hope for the best , darlin ' .
well , she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in birmingham , even if she did run away from them .
there are no flies on rose , i do n't know what you 're talking about .
well , i 'll admit i do n't see any flies on her yet .
and she 's such a good-hearted thing , there is n't an ounce of harm or malice in her .
um-hmm . almost too perfect .
honey , she 's perfect . she works all the time and she 's wonderful with the children . and they love her , even brother likes her though he wo n't admit it . i think she 's just perfect .
i asked you what you think of rosebud , now that she 's been here a while .
oh . did you say something ?
your hearing aid , it 's buzzing at me like a snake .
what ?
turn up your hearing aid .
what do you think of her , honey ?
slow , hon . but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here .
how goes it , darlin ' ?
yes , it 's so nice i thought i 'd work outside .
good morning , sweetheart . beautiful day .
well , well , well . so miss rosebud has arrived . un-hmm . and you 're all assembled here . yes , indeed . un hmmm .
it is n't the fourth dimension . to you it 's the fourth dimension , maybe , to me it 's simply the truth .
nothing , rose .
what was it , mr. hillyer ?
rose ... i hate to be mean , but ... oh , nevermind , forget it .
well , i 'll pay you that back sometime , mr. hillyer .
well , we know you were there . the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous .
perfect , wonderful , good as i ever felt ! except for a big old scar on my stummick , i would n't even know i been in the hospital .
you 're looking very chipper this morning , rose . sow do you feel ?
all right , damn it . we 've seen you with your clothes off around here , stand up and pull up your dress and let 's take a look !
it 's so , mr. hillyer .
i do n't believe it .
i have n't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big .
all right , tell us , rose , what makes you think you 're pregnant ?
yes , mr. hillyer , i am .
no , you 're not .
yes , i am .
good god almighty . this is a catastrophe , they wo n't hire her .
yes , mine . i 'm going to have one .
your baby ?
mine .
what baby ? what baby ? what baby are you speaking about ?
what ?
i 'm not cryin ' because of me , i 'm cryin ' because of somebody else .
no , no , not exactly . it is n't a farm in the sense that it 's a farm . not at all . it 's a ... dairy establishment . you 'll 1ike it ! i 'm sure you 'll like it because it 's so ... peaceful !
you mean a farm ?
ahh-hh , you 'll like it . it 's a fine , outdoor-type job .
well . what kinda job is it ?
yes , tennessee , a lovely state !
tennessee ?
well , i have got news ! i called long distance and spoke to cousin hop and you 'll be glad to know , rose , i have found you a job !
yes , sir .
god forbid . you 're not sick , rose , forget it . do n't get any notions in your head , you 're not sick .
mmm . would you get me another half a-cup of coffee , dear ?
what 's the use , there ai n't none .
well , rose , going out to look for a job today ?
rose , darlin ' , you break my heart . but i am only a human man myself of the father variety . rose , pack your bag , baby , as of this moment you are hired , mired and fired .
mr. hillyer , i know it was bad and i had n't ought to of done it . but i 'm only a human girl and i ... i ai n't always perfect . i promise i wo n't let him in the house no more , i promise . wo n't you and mrs. hillyer forgive me ?
under the mattress . i hid 'em so you would n't be mad . he wants to marry me , he loves me . i ca n't marry him , he 's too young and has n't got no job , but he loves me ... now you would n't hurt him , would you ?
ye gods and little fishes , a fireman . put on some clothes , rose , you 're naked as a jay bird . when you 're dressed , come on downstairs . i 'm afraid your friend billy is injured , where are his clothes ?
he 's a nice boy , you 'd like him . he wants to be a fireman .
well , it was a silly question .
well , mr. hillyer , billy 's very poor , he do n't have no money and there was n't no place else to go .
and what , may i ask , was billy doing here ?
well , it 's billy .
and who , rose , may i ask , is that ?
where is he ? where have you got him hid ? ah , ha !
there ai n't nobody here , mr. hillyer ! honest , there ai n't !
yes , sir .
i mean a human investment , rose , we care about you , you matter to us . but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop . do you hear me ?
yes , air .
i will see you at suppertime , rose .
i did n't mean to bite him , i really did n't .
i have to go back to the hotel . i 'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive . i will see you at suppertime , rose .
i did n't mean to bite him . he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and ... and i bit him accidental .
well , i do n't know what happened . they were arguin ' about baseball , then all of 'em started fightin ' . as for that policeman , i did n't bite him , i do n't think i bit him .
that 's all you 've got to say , you 've got a bad cold ?
i got an awful bad cold .
oh , no , sir .
umm . well . yes . but no more strange voices in the night , rose .
boy , for four or five days there i did n't think i 'd live . but i 'm my old self again !
well , i know it , i just got the bill for it .
wonderful . except i can touch the place back there with my tongue , i would n't even know i had that tooth pulled .
good morning , rose . and how do you feel today ?
yes , sir .
all right , thanks to her , and thanks to this case of epizootics , you are getting another chance . but do n't try my patience again . we have growing children in this house . do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
darlin ' , i 'll take a taxi to the hotel . you and brother can handle the girl 's epizootics . i 'll just say one more thing . rose , i told you you had a friend in mrs. hillyer , did n't i , that she would fight for you like a tiger ?
i 'm not hungry .
oh , shut up , rose , eat your cornflakes !
ohhh-hh , ohhh ...
now rose , stop behaving as if you 're bo peep . those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house , and it was n't dolly or mrs. hillyer .
yes , sir .
strange voices , rose ?
yes , mr. hillyer , it was . i ... i heard strange voices in the night .
well , rose , my sleep was a little disturbed last night , and so was mrs. hillyer 's , and so was the children 's . how about you ? was your sleep disturbed , too ?
it 'll do just fine . bye-bye , see you later .
is this ill right ?
oh , i 'll just mosey around here and there .
you do n't know where you 're going ?
oh , anywhere downtown .
where do you want me to let you out , rose ?
yes , sir . i had to go to the bathroom .
you were up late last night , too , rose .
my rose . it 's kind of like a motto . people will say , there comes rose with her rose .
what have you got in your hair , girl ?
there are more on the other side .
how can the buttons stand the pressure ?
well , it has buttons .
that 's a pretty stylish skirt , rose . the only thing i do n't understand is how did you ever get it on .
um-hmmuhh . i never drink a whole cup , my nerves ca n't stand the caffeine . ehh-hh , lord awful insomnia in reverse last night . lay there and sweated blood for hours .
why , sure , always got time to get you a half-a-cup , and one of these days i 'm gon na get you a whole cup and see what happens .
if you 've got time before you go `` out , '' get me a half-a-cup of coffee , rose . not a whole cup , a half-a-cup .
you 're so sweet .
yeah . i 'm goin ' out .
got yourself up ?
nothin ' . i got myself up , that 's all .
well , good night .
no , sir .
is anything wrong ?
nothin ' , just goin ' to the bathroom .
rose , what are you doing up ?
do you know what a friend you have got there ? do you know she would fight for you like a tiger , that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you ? is this any way to repay her trust and love ? are you ashamed as i am ashamed ? do n't cry , honey , do n't cry . but let me warn you , damn your hide , this is thermopylae and i am standing here . do you hear me , damn you . i am standing at thermopylae and the persians shall not pass ! now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes , and stop crying !
oh , i know . she 's so sweet , she 's been so good to me ...
rose , rose , rose , you poor miserable little child , do n't you know i love you ? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it ? you are beautiful to me , rose , i 've loved you since you first came here , darlin ' . and do n't you know mrs. hillyer loves you , too , that she 's already taken you into her heart , and that that woman 's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars ?
oh-h , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , mr. hillyer ... i just ... could n't help myself . i 'm sorry ...
goddamn you , girl ! you 've made me make a fool out of myself , damn your hide , but let me tell you i am standing at the pass of thermopylae and i wo n't budge ! the very idea , my own home with children in the house , to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h , you had better believe i am standing at thermopylae , you little nut , you had better believe it ! what are you , crazy ? a man is supposed to be a fool like this , but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense ! are you a nitwit ? what 's the matter with you ?
calm down , rose , let 's calm down and discuss it ...
do n't make me ... me ... me ... get up !
all right , all right . now calm down , rose , the children will hear you . calm down , let 's talk ... about this thing , let 's discuss it .
no , no ! you do n't understand , i love you ! it 's real love and i ca n't help it ! please kiss me , mr. hillyer , i love you , i love you so much ...
why , i 'm not going to kiss you , you crazy girl . now i 'm telling you again , get off my lap . come on , rose , get up . now you get up , i say , and stop this !
yes , crazy about you ! kiss me , mr. hillyer !
ahh-hem ! now , rose , get off my lap . what are you doing , girl ? are you crazy ?
i ... i 'll get the grits .
rosebird baby , you are the light of my life , darlin ' . how did we ever get by without you ?
oh , i do n't know , i ... i ...
rosebaby blossom , these are the most delicious candied yams i ever ate ! why , they just melt in my mouth . and this fried chicken is fit for a king . how do you do it , peachbird ? what is the secret of your art , plum blossom , huh ?
yes , sir .
all right . now as head of this household i have a couple of remarks to make . it is my dear wife 's belief , which i accept although i do not totally grasp it , that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice . therefore , you are here not as a servant , you are here as a friend , as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family . you will eat your meals with us , you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony , dear rosebud , in love and harmony . do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
oh , to hell with it , never mind . do n't tell her anything . do n't even tell her you saw me . got to run , buddy , i 'll miss my plane .
what do you want me to tell her , dave ?
you might see her . she writes your daddy , and she and that doctor came to see him , did n't they ? i wish you 'd tell her something ... i never could write letters .
dave , i have n't seen rose for years .
ah-h , if you happen to run into rose sometime ... do me a favor , give her a message for me , will you ?
yeah , i 'll do that , dave .
well , got to get a plane to savannah . great running into you , buddy . give my best to your daddy .
yeah , i remember it .
she used to call me mr. right . remember that , buddy ?
yeah , it took her a while to grow up and find mr. right , but she did it . she found him .
you loved her , did n't you . well , so did i. you 'll have to admit she had four husbands .
dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time . to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life .
i do n't want to start no fight with you , buddy . why do you say i 'm full of shit ?
dave , you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it . now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail , go right ahead . but i am telling you , you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs .
she did n't marry him , though , later she married another guy and went to winston-salem . it did n't last that girl could n't have no lastin ' marriage , she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west . little bitch left him , too , and you know what she 's married to right now ? a kike . that 's right , some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle , who 's got the nerve to have the same first name i got . would n't you know it , rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike ? she was always out of her friggin ' head and i 'll tell you why . buddy , she was sick in her mind and between her legs , too . she was a nymphomaniac .
she 's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all . oh , i got rid of her , buddy , i did n't waste no time kickin ' that bitch out . hell , she was screwin ' everybody in savannah . i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin ' piss out of him !
well , no , i did n't actually .
doubted my ability all along , the little bitch . i never remarried , buddy , you know that , do n't you ?
um-m , well ...
that 's correct -- outside it , not in it . as for the job , well , the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ai n't worth a sorry-ass damn . but i can build anything , buddy . give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon . it 's a fact , i can build anything ... ... but she never believed that . oh , hell , no , she never believed in me .
i see . outside it .
near alexandria . it is n't in alexandria , it is outside it .
tell me about that job in alexandria , dave , the big motel you 're building .
she has other things to do , dave .
took your time gettin ' here .
hey , girl ! hey , you , give us another drink ! dumb little bitch , supposed to give us two in the first place .
that 's right , dave , i 'm headed for glenville on a whisperin ' jet .
heh heh heh heh , same old buddy , always jokin ' around . almost as much of a joker as your daddy . i saw your daddy a coupla years ago , i was up in glenville lookin ' at a motel site . i guess that 's where you 're headed , huh , to see him ?
well , actually , we have a little black boy named her -- -t who lives in the garage . he does it for me .
i do n't mean that the way it sounds . imagine it , a book . and i used to know you personal way back when . tell me something , buddy , how do you dream up all that stuff ?
oh , yeah ?
how about that . well , you always were a screwball .
page proof of a book i 'm working on .
galley what ?
galley proof .
ha ha , course you make a lot more . what 's that you got there , buddy ?
oh , it 's all right , beats jew york . but the niggers have took it over , just like every other city we got , only worse .
well , that 's interesting , dave . i always liked washington , it 's a pretty town .
well , i am in the construction business , buddy , and without braggin ' i have done real good at it . there are those who would n't have expected that out of me . right now i 'm buildin ' a giant motel unit near alexandria , outside washington , d.c. not fi-nance , i 'm on the construction side .
oh . oh , god . of course , dave , how are you ?
it 's dave wilkie ! i 'm dave wilkie , do n't you remember me ?
well , i ... i ... ah-h , let 's see ...
awww-rr , buddy , come on , you know me !
excuse me ... your voice is familiar and i 'm sure i know you from somewhere ...
i do n't know . i think he 's cryin ' !
what 's the matter with him ?
i 'm only trying to help him , mother .
you must n't be a tattletale , dear . you must n't be delilah-ish and jezebel-ish toward your brother , dear .
daddy , buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books . mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it , he took the lords name in vain , then claimed he had n't said it . he lied , daddy .
mother , buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says i would too if i was grown-up . is it true , mother -- would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says ?
yes , dear , what is it ?
daddy would n't hear that . now the redhaired boy you see sitting there , of course you have met him , he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child . all children have great creative powers , but i do n't want to rattle on about my children , they say i brag too much about them , especially about brother . am i boring you , rose ?
i do n't like that , either , it 's worse than waski . i want to be called fran .
let him be guided not by my wishes and not by rose 's wishes , although i am sure they are identical . let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself , because that is what has spoken through me tonight .
actually of course i wo n't operate , i do n't do major surgery . dr. hardy will operate and of course he 'll be guided by your wishes in this respect .
i understand you perfectly . you leave that girl alone , you wretched man , or you will be sorry .
yes , i understand you , but you have misunderstood me completely .
i will not cry like a woman . if i 'm upset it 's because of what my husband said , not because of you . you ca n't make me cry like a woman , a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man . and you get this in your head . if you hurt that girl , i 'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got , i 'll do my level best to ruin you . do you understand me ?
you 'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself , you 'd go that far ? do n't you think i know what you 've just said and do n't you think i understand the dreadful and revolting crime you 've just conspired to commit ?
illusions , madam ?
are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters ? is there no limit to which you wo n't go to keep your illusions about yourselves ?
mrs. hillyer , this girl is sick in more ways than one . she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses . it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others . therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary . it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me .
what are you talking about ? i do n't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces .
i am thinking particularly of the other ovary . as a rule i do n't believe in removing it . the woman 's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed , she is subject to possibly serious depression , she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example , her breasts might shrink and become flabby , facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features , and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished , especially in a girl or young woman . for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary , as a rule . do you follow me ?
yes , go on .
what do you mean , what kind of gobbledygook talk is that ?
i 'm sorry the truth nauseates you , mrs. hillyer , because before you leave there 's a bit more of it i 'd like to put to you . this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl , who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well .
she 's an adult , mrs. hillyer , i was merely giving her the facts .
no , you should n't have , it was needlessly cruel . she thinks she has cancer and is going to die .
we make our own lives , madam . as for malignancy , i do n't think so , it 's very unlikely . i probably should n't have even mentioned that possibility to her .
well , that 's pathetic . poor rose , what a life she has had .
do n't worry , madam , she ca n't infect your dear little kiddies . she long ago fully recovered , but the disease did irreparable damage . the girl is permanently barren .
gonorrhea ?
i 'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant . an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy . but it was pure wishful thinking on her part . the girl can never have children , she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated .
yes . well . she 's upstairs .
let me be the judge of that , madam .
oh , good evening , doctor . rose is a lot better , i just gave her her supper . she 's almost all well now .
i beg your pardon , epi-zoo-tics ? do you mean `` epi-zoo-ot-tics , '' an animal epidemic ?
yes , thank you , doctor .
it is kind of amazing . the dentist says she has perfect teeth , there is n't a cavity in her mouth .
it 's simply that i find it incredible , mr. hillyer . aside from the girl 's illness at the moment , she is very strong , a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one , too . she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child , if only sporadically .
exactly , and that 's why she could n't possibly have come from such a farm .
well , her people were very poor . she says she was often hungry as a child , and i 'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful , not a balanced diet at all .
a tenant farm ? are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ?
deathly afraid of it . her people were poor tenant farmers and she does n't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals .
afraid of the hospital ?
she hid it from us , doctor . she 's afraid of the hospital .
of course she does and i must say i 'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital . i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill .
she looks terrible , just awful .
well , mrs. hillyer , the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive . but not many people walk away from double pneumonia , madam , not many .
i think you 're right , it would be harder on her . but you 'd better call mr. hillyer , she 's going to need help to get home .
that would scare her to death . she 's terrified of hospitals . to her , a hospital is where you go to die .
yes , and it 's very bad . it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia .
but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled ?
well , she has one mouth in ten thousand , i do n't see teeth like that once in ten years . her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth , but there is n't a cavity in her head , not a single one . she has perfect teeth .
she was raised on a poor dirt farm . i 'm sure she 's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor .
well , she finally let me look in her mouth . is it true she 's never been to a dentist ?
no , waski , she wo n't die , because we are praying for her .
mother ... is rose going to die ?
there are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair . beauty is beauty and that 's all there is to it . beauty is there and we have to recognize it . now rose , the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is doll baby . she looks like an angel and she is an angel , but she can be a naughty angel sometimes , although her father wo n't believe it . her real name is frances , but we call her dolly or doll .
oh , mother , cut it out .
when he was baby we called him `` wa wa , '' a baby name , you know . you will find him a very good boy . his brother can be bad and so can his sister , but waski is a very good boy . and as you can see he 's beautiful .
you can stop it right now .
rose , this is waski . his real name is warren but we call him waski . he does n't like it much and i suppose someday we 'll have to stop calling him that .
and who do you suppose he is ? that policeman who arrested me , the one i bit ! he is mr. right !
well ... well , that 's wonderful , rose .
you 'll never guess what happened ! i have met mr. right ! i been with him all day and he loves me , i know he does , he loves me and he 's going to marry met be 's practi'cly ast me already !
forget about it , i do n't want you working in one of those honky tonks .
i was offered that job as a waitress .
do n't worry , honey , you 'll find something .
i do n't mind .
rose , you do n't have to .
oh , i know . but i did n't , really . honestly , i did n't . there was only one , but he 's out of town and leave no forwardin ' address .
rose , really , you should n't act like that .
oh-h , mrs. hillyer , i ... i ca n't think . i ... i 'm not really sure .
i know it 's embarrassing ... but who were you exposed to , dear ? rose well , now , mrs. hillyer , i ... ah-h , that 's kinda hard to say .
well , i ... i ... i do n't know ... maybe it was ... but no , you ca n't be sure about a thing like that . it was n't billy , i did n't know him .
i 'm not hungry . i ca n't eat nothin ' , i have n't been able to eat since i got fired . i think maybe i 'm sick .
rose , you do n't look well and you have n't eaten a bit of breakfast .
i do n't want to . when i was lyin ' there in that hospital bed at death 's door i says to myself , i ai n't goin ' out no more . if i ever get outta this , i 'll just stay home .
well , there 's no reason you should n't go out , rose ... in moderation .
well , you 're real sweet to make it for me . there never was nobody like you . and you do n't need to worry , i ai n't goin ' out no more .
you look very pretty in it , rose . really , you do .
yeah , it 's kinda nice .
you see , rose ? now that 's the kind of dress you ought to wear .
what ? wha-at ? mrs. hillyer ?
rose , you 're very sick . you 're burning up . rose , can you hear me ? rose ?
yes , ma'am .
rose has learned her lesson , have n't you , rose ?
it 'll get better now .
no more dentists , no more dentists ...
i know it was bad , honey . i 'm sorry ...
never again , never again ...
oh-hh , ohh-hh , lord , he 's gon na kill me .
rose , sit down in that chair and be quiet ! we 're trying to help you , you silly creature , sit in that chair !
i 'm not goin ' in there , i do n't like the looks of it !
no , rose , he 'll help you .
ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .
poor thing . does the ice help , rose ?
be quiet , rose .
i do n't want to go to the dentist .
oh ... oh ... oh ! i think ... maybe ... one of 'em ... was foster ... but i do n't hardly know him !
i do n't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children .
i had better call daddy .
mrs. hillyer , i do n't know who he is , i really do n't .
rose , that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again .
doll , you and waski run on , too .
yes , ma'am .
oh , no , that 's the style . it 's meant to be clinging .
well , i think it 's charming , rose . but do n't you think ... ah , the skirt is a little tight ?
you look sick if you ask me . i hate to leave you with the dishes and all , but i 'm supposed to go to a meeting of the garden club this evening . i 'll need the car keys .
no , ma'am , i 'm just fine .
rose , you 're in an awful dither tonight . what 's the matter with you , honey , are you sick or something ?
yes , ma'am .
well , you run on now .
i like to work . i do n't mind work . it 's the least i can do after all you and mr. hillyer have done for me . you 're so sweet . there never was nobody like you .
really , why do n't you go sit down somewhere ?
you 're so sweet .
rose , you work too hard . why do n't you go sit down somewhere and drink a co-cola ?
it must be wonderful to be so smart . i do n't see how you do it , reading all those books , learning all that stuff .
well , i am working on my thesis .
are you going to get your degree soon ?
more history , rose .
what are you studying now , mrs. hillyer ?
well , it 's rather interesting about brother , actually . i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old . he looked at me and understood me , he knew exactly who i was . i know it sounds crazy but it 's true . he 's very remarkable , he was born for the ministry and could move millions , but he does n't know that yet . i have to warn you about him , he can be very dangerous , there is an evil streak in him , a streak of pure sheer meanness . but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he does n't know it .
oh , no , ma'am .
... okay ... you made your point .
has n't he got enough problems , or did n't you notice that 's not cream soda on his breath ?
maybe i 'm not making myself clear . you 're probably the first girl billy-boy 's ever fallen in love with , and i know for sure you 're the first he 's slept with . so , how 's he gon na feel ... ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who did n't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up ?
what ... what makes you think you can order me around ? !
you 're not gon na see him again .
let me tell him . let him decide .
but ... i love him . i do ...
what were you gon na say ? exactly how did you think he was gon na make the leap from dating a sweet , innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star ?
i was going to tell him .
i 'm looking at this poster , and i 'm thinkin ' , i do n't remember seeing films like this when i was in school .
i ... i can explain ...
fair enough .
we 'll take the caltrust heist , but if it 's no good , we will hunt you down , and billy-boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it .
read my lips : zimmermann or nothing .
come on , do n't you screw with her , please ! you ... you got to want this : armored car job . caltrust bank . they took two million in cash ...
careful she does n't hit her head on the way .
alright , wait ... there 's a dentist in brentwood peddling morphine ...
who cares ?
hey , listen ... i 'll give you something else , kittle . anything . remember ... remember that corpse washed up on huntington beach ? it was never identified ...
take her down to the car , and for christ 's sake be careful this time . last suspect he took in , butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs . what a mess . why is it we do n't appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?
cuff'em . let 's see what these two love birds say once they 're sitting in separate cages .
have i ever steered you wrong ?
am i supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin ' telescope ?
now you know what to watch for ...
a lincoln ? what lincoln ? lincoln continental ? lincoln mark five ... six ... ?
what and ? that 's what i got .
and ... ?
okay , man , okay . i 'm with you . i ... i heard how the shit 's arriving ... it 's coming in a lincoln .
you get nothing and like it . and if we 're not blissfully happy with what you tell us , we arrest you just for the fun of it .
well ... what can i do ? you 've created a dilemma ... and , look at the that . time 's running out . i wonder ... how can i impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me ?
i 'll tell you what ... i think it 's all you 've got .
you think it 's that good ?
i figure , for this information , the usual payment ... times ten .
how much ?
a little birdie whispered in my ear today ... about the needle-candy you 're chasing . it 's up here ... ... in the old curiosity shop .
put up your kickstand , freak . start talking , or we 're out the door .
what eve and i would n't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain .
every person 's got their own kinks , beef-cake . what 's wrong , kittle ? you do n't swing ?
incestuous .
indivisible and inseparable .
abe lincoln ...

three hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of abraham lincoln . a parade float .

if i tell you , how do i know you wo n't just club me and take it back ?
it 's six o'clock . time 's runaing out . decide .
i do n't know . fuck off !
well , i 'm running out of trees , so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you do n't know ! convince me !
i 'm telling you , you 're barking up the wrong tree .
you 're zimmermann 's calculator , archie . all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal , you got to know something . maybe they told you , maybe you overheard things you were n't supposed to hear ...
just entering . we 'll get to the breaking in a minute .
this is private property . this is breaking and entering !
i do n't know , okay ? all i know is butch cassidy 's back in town .
i need the `` when '' and the `` where . ''
it 's bone dry out there . everybody 's hurting . the stuff floating around 's been cut so many times it 's like powdered sugar , but zimnermann 's gon na fix it .
alright ! alright ... put me down ...
last time billy-boy did this , the guy 's neck broke ... ... just like that . sad in a way . why is it we do n't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?
this scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the mexican border high as a kite for the next two years . you think we 're gon na let zimmermann haul it onto < u > our < /u > streets on the fourth-of-fucking-july ! ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about , man . even if i did , i 'm not so crazy i 'm gon na cross zimmermann .
know what he 's doing , benny ? he 's trying to jog your memory .
again .
hey now ... what the fuck ... ?

thank you , concerned citizen .
you should n't litter .
what , am i supposed to read it while i drive ? keep a grip on it , alright ?
jeez ... it 's too early in the morning for this . leave off . here 's your paper .
she 's right . if you two are doing the horizontal polka , the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around , knocking over furniture and calling you `` daddy . ''
it 's the way you say it , like there 's something more too it .
what 'd i say ?
lay off once , would you ?
nothing , i guess . just an observation . she 's really something special . you 're a lucky fella .
filthy kids go to kindergarten too . what are you saying , anyhow ?
tell me something ... what 's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville ? i mean , this is not the place for fine dining , unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite .
she 's fine , as if you cared .
how 's your precious little school-marm today ?
we 've got the tape to prove it .
he tried to kill us .
bummer .
there probably is .
feels like there 's a bullet still in my chest .
go wherever you want . live how you want .
you could start over again with cash like that .
what can i say to that ... except , i love you too , you mean-spirited bitch .
billy , i love you i really do ... but i 've got to tell you , every day , in every way , you give new meaning to the word `` stupidity . ''
oh . well . i think it 's pretty common knowledge that in the battle of little big horn , custer was drunk off his ass .
nope .
general jim beam , then .
no .
what about jack daniels ? was n't he a decorated general in the civil war ?
i 'm waiting till the time 's right .
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ?
you 're lying ...
do n't talk like that . there 's plenty of women around for jerks like you .
... where ... where 's a jerk like me ever gon na find another girl to love him ... huh ? ...
whoa , whoa ... it 's gon na be alright .
speak for yourself .
if we do n't catch a break soon , we 're gon na be left standing with our dicks in our hands .
bad news is , word 's spreading like wildfire that we do n't have badges , and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like butch cassidy either .
okay . it does n't smell as bad in here as i remember it smelling .
ca n't you say something nice once ?
you live like a pig .
well , i got something.. pop-sweet 's accounting ledger for the disco-strip . all the money transactions . look ... someone 's putting their initials beside the weekly totals . like they 're acknowledging a deposit .
who said it wa 's me , hub ? anyway ... he fell off a ladder . it was n't really my fault .
then , why 'd we tie him up ?
this is the police lock-up . we 're police . how can we steal from ourselves ?
no , we 're stealing .
we 're not stealing . we 're borrowing .
i ca n't believe we 're stealing .
hey ... hey ! cool down , jumbo !
let 's go ! fuck everything ! god damn sons of bitching mother humpers ... i 'm gon na rip'em all brand new assholes ... !
just keep an eye out till i get this rig up and running .
okay . but , what changed our mind ?
we have to find kittle .
where we going ?
how come everyone thinks hitting me 's the best way to get my attention ?
follow me .
what the ... ? ! what was that for ?
you 'll cry like a great big , blubbering baby .
laugh it up . you 'll cry later .
what was i supposed to do ?
smooth move , hot-shot .
it 's go time , billy-b .
that 's him alright .
forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
hey ...
no , but it should .
it does n't say that .
`` leo . the stages of the moon are in alignment , so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement . wash yourself more carefully each morning , stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment , and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear . ''
what 's mine say ?
oh ... okay .
i 'm back here , are n't i ? so , you do n't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it .
you never heard of physics , einstein ? the laws of physics . the more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires ...
bullshit .
you know , the more weight back there , the faster the car goes .
what ... what kinda thing is that to say ?
birth control 's important .
wha ... ?
you been wearing rubbers , billy-boy ?
it 's not gon na happen .
well , i would like to sit in front today .
it 's just the way things are , kiddo .
why do i always have to sit in back ?
there was a time when you did things the right way , till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister .
you mean taking bribes , and skimming busts and letting hoods walk ? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe ?
what happened , kittle ? we used to be friends . you used to know how the game was played .
maybe .
you going rogue on me ?
our resignations .
i 'm here . that 's all that counts . watch ... you 'll enjoy this ... it 's like magic ...
where have you been ?
i 'm gon na put a great big , ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face . how 'bout that ?
not like this . are you even listening ?
there 'll be other chances .
hey now , look ! let 's all get on the same page here . this shipment is do or die for zimmermann 's syndicate ; all or nothing . if we stop the drugs , we do n't even have to catch him red-handed . he 's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell . on the other hand , if we fuck this up , it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that does n't have a single empty drawer . more old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks , and all the while zimmermann 's sitting back and laughing his head off .
yes , sir .
well , shake a leg . get these files downstairs ... and , quit listening to your fucking voodoo music .
he went to pick up lunch .
we 've been chasing this deal six months , and now you 're gon na chuck it out the window ?
ca n't i ?
you ca n't be serious .
it 's noon straight up . effective immediately , you three work desk jobs till midnight .
till the last firework fizzles out tonight , detective , you sit a desk . and , after that , i 'll decide if you keep your shield .
well ... seeing how you just suspended me , what 's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard , you old fart ?
you 're about an inch away from insubordination !
do n't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor independence day , and do n't tell me i 'm overreacting when i 'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city !
what ?
do n't bother . this behavior 's gone on too long . you 're suspended .
i ... i think i can ... clarify ...
no . do n't open your mouth ! you < u > honestly < /u > think you can explain this to my satisfaction ?
well , sir ...
and , what ... what am i forgetting ? oh , yes ... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house !
you think you accomplished something ... like you 're heroes ? fuck you ! this is meaningless ! you 'll never win ! you know , as soon as i 'm gone ... someone 's going to take my place .
it 's our job .
you fuckers ... damn you ! why ? ! why me ! ? why the obsession with me ?
wave that flag , hero . keep dreaming those dreams .
your poison 's not gon na make it into the veins of any kids this time .
i insist . what will it be ? boston tea party clam chowder , or maybe the chicken red , white and cordon bleu ? no ... there 's a special on the menu , today only ... ... < u > roasted < /u > < u > pig < /u > .
thanks , but we do n't recognize `` brunch '' as an actual meal .
murderer ? really ?
just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club , does n't make you any less a murderer .
you bust some small-time pimps , whores and dime-bag junkies , like the world 's a better place because you 're in it . and for what , kittle ... two hundred and fifty dollars a week ? tell me , how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent ?
could n't have said it better myself .
thank you for sharing that charming image .
just wanted to make you aware ... before today 's over , we 'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you .
what can we do for you , officers ? what new , mindless harassments have you planned this morning ?
good . thought i was imagining them .
yeah .
you see that ?
keep 'em busy .
the gang 's all here !
well , that 's what i heard , and that 's what i choose to believe .
i do n't think so .
when you bunch it together , it 's exponentially more powerful . two sticks have the power of four sticks . four sticks have the power of sixteen , and so on .
do tell .
know what i love about dynamite ?
oh , yeah ... the explosion .
so there 's nobody around to get killed in the explosion .
why the beach ?
billy ! billy !
you john-wilkes-booth-ed him .
who the fuck knows ? we 'll find out soon enough .
think zimmermann 's watching ?
beholden to none .
no more counting the big money for someone else .
there 's not even enough places to stash it in a car .
this much powder you do n't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it . it 's got to be smuggled .
i 'm well aware of that .
we 're screwed .
it 's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans .
see ... now that we know you know , the hard part 's done for us .
you suck at lying , archie .
seatbelts fastened , please .
you 're ... you 're not doing what i think you 're doing ... ?
you mean , besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer ?
what the hell 's his problem ?
who is that ... ?
hey-ho ... ! maybe we 're not alone in this thing after all .
your wish is my command .
get his attention .
maybe it 's enough .
archibald dobbs ; certified public accountant . but , that 's all we got .
come again ... ?
a.d. is a c.p.a .
how 'd we do ?
just got here .
been waiting long ?
sounds good .
alright ... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together ? find out who `` a.d. '' is . i got a quick errand to run .
gimmie a minute .
if it is , that 's pretty high up on the totem pole . what do you think ?
chalk up another victory for billy-boy 's one man war on crime .
dead .
you get him ?
out here . on your knees .
alright , flesh-peddler , let 's see empty hands !
all for one ...
let 's get this thing done .
whatever goes bang .
any preferences ?
nothing 's broke . keep sewing . and quit pacing , you big ox . you 're making me skittish .
you need a doctor .
guys ... all we 've got is each other . do n't we know that by now ?
yeah , my arms healed up real good , and that 's how i wan na keep 'em . that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .
i know it is , even if you do n't .
that 's not true .
i worked my ass off for my badge , kittle , it 's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there .
i ca n't believe i 'm hearing this ,
he 's right . we hit the bricks , we walk back triple-fucked .
what ... ? not you too ?
is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice ?
you put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate ... make him spin out ...
i kinda already figured that , but keep those helpful hints coming .
get closer ! do n't lose him !
okay , okay ... hold on . do n't go getting your panties in a knot ...
that 's right , white bread . give it up . right now .
oh yeah ?
ca n't be worse than you .
you think this is so easy ?
you ... suck ! you almost got us all killed !
no , we are < u > not < /u > going to do that .
i 'm gon na get beside . nena , you 're gon na shoot out his tires .
no you 're not .
i 'm gon na get beside him .
let 's hope .
if they crash , maybe he 'll run . you can shoot him in the leg or something .
shit . you 're right .
hold your horses , sweetpea . we need butch cassidy alive , remember ?
do n't crowd him .
`` go , go , go ! '' `` slow down . '' make up your mind .
slow down .
we got him .
absolutely .
alright ?
all i 'm saying is , your little bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper could n't get out .
yeah , well ... nobody 's perfect . they could n't go doing everything at once .
second of all , the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality , but it did n't do anything about slavery , did it ?
you know what i mean .
first of all , the constitution was n't writtem till 1787 ...
i just think you should show some respect . i mean , call me old fashioned , but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence , they did that so we could all share in the freedom ...
what are you , communist ? at least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them .
you 're the one with the star-spangled hard-on , not me .
you know ... you could say thank you .
yeah ... great .
let me see that ... not bad .
`` today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field . by your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character , you will come up a winner . ''
look out ! jupiter and saturn 'll get you every fucking time .
yeah , non-believer ? here 's yours ... `` scorpio , october 24 to november 22 : jupiter is in conflict with saturn , so proceed with caution ... ''
why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap ? some fruitcake 's writing it between bong hits , making it up as he goes , and you 're actually taking the time to read it .
going into zimmermann 's pipeline .
arriving tonight
you are such a disappointment , benny .
pure horse .
whoops ... do n't mind me . go ahead and finish up .
pardon me ... my mistake . taking your thoughts in hand , huh ... ?
well , let me tell you how it is ...
the way zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling `` escort service '' of yours , i figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight .
yeah ? so , what do you want to ask today that i ca n't answer ? i 'm a busy man .
they 're ... around .
where 's your pet gorilla and the female uncle tom ?
that 's the problem with expensive tastes ... the more you got , the more you got to lose .
this shit was ming .
so are you , pop-sweet . that 's why ...
it 's one of a kind .
you always did have style .
we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !
the shield is down ! commence attack on thedeath star 's main reactor .
we 'll last longer then we will against that death star ... and we might just take a few of them with us .
at that close range , we wo n't last long against those star destroyers .
han will have that shield down . we 've got to give him more time .
we have no choice , general calrissian . our cruisers ca n't repel firepower of that magnitude .
you wo n't get another chance at this , admiral .
we saw it . all craft prepare to retreat .
all right . stand by .
all craft , prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark .
proceed with the countdown . all groups assume attack coordinates .
admiral , we 're in position . all fighters accounted for .
she has n't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have , luke ... but the force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . there is no avoiding the battle . you must face and destroy vader !
but you ca n't let her get involved now , ben . vader will destroy her .
your insight serves you well . bury your feelings deep down , luke . they do you credit . but they could be made to serve the emperor .
leia ! leia 's my sister .
hmm . to protect you both from the emperor , you were hidden from your father when you were born . the emperor knew , as i did , if anakin were to have any offspring , they would be a threat to him . that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous .
but i have no sister .
the other he spoke of is your twin sister .
yoda spoke of another .
then the emperor has already won . you were our only hope .
i ca n't kill my own father .
to be a jedi , luke , you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father could n't get past . impatience is the easiest door - for you , like your father . only , your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door , and you have held firm . you 're no longer so reckless now , luke . you are strong and patient . and now , you must face darth vader again !
but i had to help my friends .
vader humbled you when first you met him , luke ... but that experience was part of your training . it taught you , among other things , the value of patience . had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then , you could have finished your training here with yoda . you would have been prepared .
i tried to stop him once . i could n't do it .
you can not escape your destiny .
i ca n't do it , ben .
i also thought he could be turned back to the good side . it could n't be done . he is more machine now than man . twisted and evil .
there 's still good in him .
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view .
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father .
yoda will always be with you .
i ca n't do it , artoo . i ca n't go on alone .
who are you ?
jabba 's palace .
where am i ?
your eyesight will return in time .
i ca n't see .
shhh . you have hibernation sickness .
his lightsaber .
oh , no , my young jedi . you will find that it is you who are mistaken ... about a great many things .
then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them .
they are clear , my master .
strange , that i have not . i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear , lord vader .
i have felt him , my master .
a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor .
i told you to remain on the command ship .
yes , my master .
it is of no concern . soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us ! your work here is finished , my friend . go out to the command ship and await my orders .
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust ?
send the fleet to the far side of endor . there it will stay until called for .
what is thy bidding , my master ?
everything is proceeding as i have foreseen .
as you wish .
patience , my friend . in time he will seek you out . and when he does , you must bring him before me . he has grown strong . only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force .
yes , my master .
you have done well , lord vader . and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker .
the death star will be completed on schedule .
threepio , tell them if they do n't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic .
somehow , i got the feeling that did n't help us very much .
han , do n't . it 'll be all right .
hey !
yeah , sure .
will you take it easy ? let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . han , can you reach my lightsaber ?
nice work . great , chewie ! great ! always thinking with your stomach .
come on , artoo . we 'll need your scanners .
take the squad ahead . we 'll meet at the shield generator at 0300 .
we got separated .
i thought she was with you .
quietly , there might be more of them out there .
chewie and i will take care of this . you stay here .
it 's your imagination , kid . come on . let 's keep a little optimism here .
i 'm endangering the mission . i should n't have come .
i do n't know . fly casual .
now do n't get jittery , luke . there are a lot of command ships . keep your distance though , chewie , but do n't look like you 're trying to keep your distance .
vader 's on that ship .
all set .
right . chewie , let 's see what this piece of junk can do . ready , everybody ?
yeah , she 's comin ' up .
you got her warmed ?
hi , han ... chewie .
luke .
i have a promise i have to keep first ... to an old friend .
why do n't you leave that crate and come with us ?
oh ... great !
just stick close to chewie and lando . i 've taken care of everything .
you 're gon na die here , you know . convenient .
there 's nothing to see . i used to live here , you know .
i think my eyes are getting better . instead of a big dark blur , i see a big light blur .
that bad , huh ? where 's leia ?
the same as always .
how are we doing ?
would n't miss it .
fine . together again , huh ?
are you all right ?
luke !
han !
all right . i understand . fine . when he comes back , i wo n't get in the way .
yes .
you love him , do n't you ?
he was n't . i can feel it .
i 'm sure luke was n't on that thing when it blew .
here 's the terminal .
the code 's changed . we need artoo !
charges ! come on , come on !
han ! hurry ! the fleet will be here any moment .
hey , do n't worry . chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
the main entrance to the control bunker 's on the far side of that landing platform . this is n't gon na be easy .
hold me .
i 'm sorry .
ahhh ...
i ...
i do n't know .
what 's going on ?
it 'll take time . this whole party 'll be for nothing if they see us .
shall we try and go around ?
it 'll work . it 'll work .
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .
yeah , i just got a funny feeling . like i 'm not gon na see her again .
hey , are you awake ?
that 's all any of us can see .
i do n't know . all i can see is a lot of blowing sand !
i got ta get you out of here .
leia !
someone who loves you .
you , too .
good luck .
all right , old buddy . you know , i know what she means to you . i 'll take good care of her . she-she wo n't get a scratch . all right ?
look . i want you to take her . i mean it . take her . you need all the help you can get . she 's the fastest ship in the fleet .
oh , well , someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab .
well , look at you , a general , huh ?
figured if i left you frozen like that you 'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life , so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later .
guess i owe you some thanks , too , lando .
all right ! a little higher ! just a little higher !
it 's all right . trust me . do n't move .
no , wait ! i thought you were blind !
chewie ! chewie , give me the gun . do n't move , lando .
i 'm trying !
lower it !
lando , grab it !
lando !
han ! chewie ?
let 's see .
oh , princess leia , are you all right ?
well , i suppose i could hotwire this thing .
my goodness ! artoo , why did you have to be so brave ?
oh , artoo , hurry !
come on ! come on !
we 're coming !
i 'm rather embarrassed , general solo , but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor .
what did he say ?
it 's against my programming to impersonate a deity .
proper ? !
i beg your pardon , general solo , but that just would n't be proper .
well , why do n't you use your divine influence and get us out of this ?
hello , i think ... i could be mistaken . they 're using a very primitive dialect . but i do believe they think i am some sort of god .
what are you telling them ?
all right , hang on .
here we go again .
on second thought , let 's pass on that , huh ?
in his belly , you will find a new definition of pain and suffering , as you are slowly digested over a thousand years .
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon , the nesting place of the all-powerful sarlacc .
good , i hate long waits .
oh , dear . his high exaltedness , the great jabba the hutt , has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately .
i hope so , commander , for your sake . the emperor is not as forgiving as i am .
we shall double our efforts .
that is correct , commander . and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .
then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives .
but he asks the impossible . i need more men .
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
i tell you , this station will be operational as planned .
perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them .
i assure you , lord vader , my men are working as fast as they can .
you may dispense with the pleasantries , commander . i 'm here to put you back on schedule .
lord vader , this is an unexpected pleasure . we 're honored by your presence .
copy , gold leader . i 'm already on my way out .
all right , wedge . go for the power regulator on the north tower .
there it is !
form up . and stay alert . we could run out of space real fast .
now lock onto the strongest power source . it should be the power generator .
here goes nothing .
i 'm going in .
now ... come on , han , old buddy . do n't let me down .
good shot , red two .
red leader standing by .
all wings report in .
oh , no .
i 'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash .
quiet .
oh ! oh , my . uh , princess leia !
he says there 's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge .
what 's he saying ?
your royal highness .
oh !
ohhh , i ca n't bear to watch .
ugh !
because ... there is good in him . i 've felt it . he wo n't turn me over to the emperor . i can save him . i can turn him back to the good side . i have to try .
but , why must you confront him ?
no , you do n't . you 've always been strong .
no ! luke , run away , far away . if he can feel your presence , then leave this place . i wish i could go with you .
then you know why i have to face him .
i know . somehow ... i 've always known .
yes . it 's you leia .
you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .
luke , do n't talk that way . you have a power i -- i do n't understand and could never have .
there 's more . it wo n't be easy for you to hear it , but you must . if i do n't make it back , you 're the only hope for the alliance .
your father ?
he 's my father .
vader is here ... now , on this moon .
luke , tell me . what 's troubling you ?
i have no memory of my mother . i never knew her .
she was very beautiful . kind , but ... sad . why are you asking me all this ?
tell me .
just ... images , really . feelings .
what do you remember ?
just a little bit . she died when i was very young .
leia ... do you remember your mother ? your real mother ?
i see them . wait , leia !
over there ! two more of them !
never-r-r !
sister ! so ... you have a twin sister . your feelings have now betrayed her , too . obi-wan was wise to hide her from me . now his failure is complete . if you will not turn to the dark side , then perhaps she will .
give yourself to the dark side . it is the only way you can save your friends . yes , your thoughts betray you . your feelings for them are strong . especially for ...
i will not fight you .
you can not hide forever , luke .
you underestimate the power of the dark side . if you will not fight , then you will meet your destiny .
you could n't bring yourself to kill me before , and i do n't believe you 'll destroy me now .
there is no conflict .
your thoughts betray you , father . i feel the good in you ... the conflict .
i will not fight you , father .
obi-wan has taught you well .
it is too late for me , son . the emperor will show you the true nature of the force . he is your master now .
search your feelings , father . you ca n't do this . i feel the conflict within you . let go of your hate .
if that is your destiny .
i will not turn ... and you 'll be forced to kill me .
you do n't know the power of the dark side . i must obey my master .
obi-wan once thought as you do .
come with me .
so , you have accepted the truth .
i know , father .
the emperor has been expecting you .
remember , a jedi 's strength flows from the force . but beware . anger , fear , aggression . the dark side are they . once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny .
well , i 'm sorry .
unfortunate that i know the truth ?
unexpected this is , and unfortunate ...
yes .
told you , did he ?
your father he is .
yoda , i must know .
no more training do you require . already know you that which you need .
but i need your help . i 've come back to complete the training .
strong am i with the force ... but not that strong ! twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . that is the way of things ... the way of the force .
master yoda , you ca n't die .
disintegrated ?
splendid ! we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him .
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication , and can readily ...
how many languages do you speak ?
oh . well , yes .
yes or no will do .
i am see-threepio , human-cy ...
ah , good . new acquisitions . you are a protocol droid , are you not ?
you are - so quake with fear , you tiny fools .
it 's as if we were glued to the spot .
rocky !
janet !
hmmmm . he 'll be in the zen room .
he might be . i do n't know .
and now he works for your government , does n't he , brad ? he 's attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u.f.o 's . is n't he , brad ?
he was a science teacher at denton high .
i know what you told me , brad . but this dr everett scott . his name is not unknown to me .
i was telling the truth .
i told you , my car broke down .
i see . so this was n't simply a chance meeting . you came here with a purpose .
on my mother 's grave .
you promise you wo n't tell ?
oh come on , brad , admit it . it was enjoyable , was n't it ? there 's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure .
like this . like how ? it 's your fault - you 're to blame . i thought it was the real thing .
shush . janet 's probably asleep by now . do you want her to see you like this ?
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet . janet .
i know , but it was n't all bad was it ? i think you found it quite pleasurable . oh so soft . so sensual .
you tricked me . i would n't have - i 've never - never .
nothing . why do you think i should ?
why you - what have you done with janet ?
i 'm afraid so , brad . but was n't it nice ?
you !
oh well . how about you .
certainly not !
do you have any tattoos brad .
janet
made me give you the eye and then panic ,
janet .
i 've one thing to say and that 's dammit , janet . i love you .
janet .
so please do n't tell me to can it .
janet .
the future is ours so let 's plan it .
if only we had n't made this journey . if only the car had n't broken down . if only we were amongst friends or sane persons .
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again . so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you 've found is back again .
i wanted to be loved completely . my body throbbed excitedly . oh brad , brad my darling , how could i have done this to you ?
so baby do n't cry like there 's no tomorrow after the night there 's a brand new day . and there 'll be no pain and no more sorrow . so wash your face and phone my place it 'll be o.k .
i could see brad 's face before me and my mind screamed no ! but my lips were hungry - too hungry .
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you 'd thought you 'd known .
i 'm engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt . but frank 's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy i 've never dreamt of before . hot , burning kisses .
i hope so my darling .
janet ! oh ! yes it 's alright . janet . everything 's going to be alright .
maybe we could try it this way .
oh do n't be so shy .
no , do n't do that .
oh , i hope so my darling . but let me switch on the light .
it 's alright janet . everything 's going to be alright .
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes , my darling - what if ...
it 's alright janet .
brad ...
weiss .
weiss .
i 'm brad majors and this is my fiancee , janet vice .
it 's alright janet , we 'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right .
oh brad .
we 'll just say where we are then go back to the car we do n't want to be any worry .
right !
i 'm here , there 's nothing to worry about .
brad - i 'm cold , i 'm wet , and plain scared .
they 're probably foreigners with ways different from our own . - they may do some more folk dancing .
this is n't the junior chamber of commerce brad .
let 's wait awhile janet . we do n't want to interfere with their celebrations .
then ask the butler - or someone .
we ca n't go anywhere until i get to a phone .
well i want to leave .
it 's just a..a party janet .
but it seems so unhealthy here .
for god 's sake keep a grip on yourself janet .
brad , please lets get out of here .
say ! do any of you guys know the madison ?
oh ... .say something .
oh , it 's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .
oh brad , i 'm frightened . what kind of place is this ?
yes .
yes , the rain has been very heavy .
just a moment , janet . they may have a telephone .
oh , brad . let 's go back . i 'm cold and i 'm frightened .
i 'm coming with you . besides , darling , the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back .
there 's no point both of us getting wet .
i 'm coming with you .
did n't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles ? maybe they have a telephone i might use .
but where will you go ? we 're in the middle of nowhere .
you 'd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help .
oh ...
we must have a blow-out .
what was that bang ?
hmmm ... well , i guess we will have to turn back .
oh dear ! but then where did the motorcyclists come from ?
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back .
yes , janet . life 's pretty cheap to that type .
gosh . that 's the third motorcyclist that 's passed us . they certainly take their lives in their hands . what with the weather and all .
dammit , janet .
oh brad , i 'm mad .
for you .
oh janet
oh brad .
i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride 's bouquet .
uh huh .
i 've got something to say .
yes brad .
yes .
and ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so .
yes .
everyone knows betty 's a wonderful little cook .
yes .
yes .
good god .
i most certainly do . he happens to be an old friend of mine .
you know this earth - this person .
great scott - scotty - dr everett scott .
you 're wet .
uh - oh - hi ! my name is brad majors . and this is my fiancee , janet weiss . i - ah - wondered if you could help us . our car has broken down about two miles up the road . do you have a phone we might use ?
hello .
you must leave now dr scott while it 's still possible . we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania . go now .
yes , well perhaps it was for the best .
dr scott i 'm sorry about your nephew .
you 're ok by me .
a decision had to be made .
you did right .
yes , dr scott . a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter .
great heavens , that 's a laser .
makes you cry
what guy
makes you cry
what a guy
cross my heart and hope to die .
promise you wo n't tell brad .
well , i 'm sure you 're not spent yet .
like this - like how ? it 's your fault . you 're to blame . i was saving myself .
ssssh . brad 's probably asleep by now . do you want him to see you like this ?
i know . but it was n't all bad was it ? in fact , i think you found it quite pleasurable . mmmmm so soft , so sensual .
you tricked me - i would n't have - i 've never - never
nothing . why , do you think i should ?
you beast , you monster , what have you done with brad ?
i did n't make him for you
well . i do n't like men with ... er , with too many , muscles .
cards for sorrow , cards for pain .

the master is not yet married . nor do i think he ever will be . we are simply his servants .

you 're too kind .
i think you had better both come inside .

creature of the night .
creature of the night .
c'mon , it 's true -- but that do n't bother me -- i just wan na prove somethin ' -- i ai n't no bum ... it do n't matter if i lose ... do n't matter if he opens my head ... the only thing i wan na do is go the distance -- that 's all . nobody 's ever gone fifteen rounds with creed . if i go them fifteen rounds , an ' that bell rings an ' i 'm still standin ' , i 'm gon na know then i were n't just another bum from the neighborhood ...
do n't say that .
it ai n't so bad , 'cause i was a nothin ' before --
oh , rocky -- you worked so hard .

i been watchin ' the movies -- studyin ' -- he ai n't weak nowhere .
yeah , i ca n't beat him .

... i ca n't beat him .
... what ?
... ca n't do it .
i got ta go out for a while .
is everything all right ?
i do n't want ya cleanin ' nobody else 's cages no more .
what did you say about a pet shop ?
... what ?
what was that you said about a pet shop ?
yeah ...
rocky , do you realize everybody in this country knows your face , and after the fight everybody in the world is going to .
... yes --
wan na hear a dirty joke ?
... what 's to say ? i dunno what he wants from me --
... are you going to say anything to him ?
yo -- i ai n't mad . i 'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an ' paulie knows it .
do n't be mad at him -- he just wants to help .
yeah ... threw my whole day off .
... and he called the reporters --
ya right -- mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty , y'know .
i thought it might be cute .
yeah ... but i think weak legs ai n't bad sometimes , y'know .
-- the legs .
ca n't fool around -- you look very great .
do n't want weak legs .
adrian , you really look great , y'know -- but i ca n't fool around durin ' trainin ' -- makes the legs weak .
no ... sharp -- you look great .
really -- you do n't think they 're overly feminine ?
sharp -- real nice .
like ?
they either say , 'kill the nigger ' or 'hope you die , honky . ' -- what ya got in the bag ?
do n't you open them anymore ?
it did .
yes .
y'know how i said that stuff on television did n't bother me ?
i 'll be waiting .
'bout seven .
absolutely -- what time should i expect you ?
ya puttin ' me on , right ?
i do n't know -- i was shocked . why did you do that ?
how 'd ya like hearin ' ya name on tv ?
do n't tease me .
i always knew you was pretty .
could ya take off that hat .
... what ?
do me another favor ?
... t-thank you .
the glasses ... please .
what ?
would ya take off your glasses ?
but i 'm willin ' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation .
i should leave .
yo , i 'm not comfortable either .
i 'm not sure i know you well enough -- i do n't think i 'm comfortable .
they 're all the same .
... i 've never been in a man 's apartment before .
it 's all right -- you 're my guest .
no , i do n't belong here .
it 's okay .
i do n't think i belong here .
what 's the problem ? you do n't like me -- do n't like the turtles -- what is it ?
it 's not that --
it 's only temporary .
it 's fine .
what 's the matter ? ya do n't like the room ?
i 'll call your brother .
i think he might be worried .
why ?
yes .
you sure ?
yes , i do .
d'you really wan na call ?
i wan na let my brother know where i am .
i had it pulled . people callin ' all the time . who needs it -- who 'd you wan na call ?
do you have a phone ?
... oh , yeah , i bought the whole kit -- yeah , ya sold me the turtles , the bowl , an ' the mountain -- i had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin ' off .
i sold them to you .
here 's the guys i was tellin ' ya about -- this is cuff an ' link .
... no thanks .
would ya like a glass of water ?
'cause you ca n't sing or dance ?
... guess .
why do you do it if it hurts so bad ?
after a rough fight , ya ' nothin ' but a large wound . sometimes i feel like callin ' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom ... ya ' eyes hurt , ya ' ears hurt , ya ' hair even hurts ... but the thing i 'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an ' never had a busted nose -- bent an ' twisted an ' bitten but never broke ... that 's rare .
morning after ?
... i 'm at least half a bum . yeah , fightin ' is a crazy racket . the roughest part is the mornin ' after .
i do n't think you 're a bum .
ya got ta be a little soft to wan na be a pug ... it 's a racket where ya ' almost guaranteed to end up a bum .
... it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter .
then why did i bother bringin ' it up ? 'cause i 'm dumb , that 's why ... y'know , i think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- i 'm dumb an ' you 're shy .
it does n't bother me either .
some people think bein ' shy is a disease , but it do n't bother me .
... i suppose .
i would say you 're very shy by nature .
... i suppose .
some people are very shy by nature .
my mother told me just the opposite . she said , 'you were n't born with much of a body so you 'd better develop your brain . '
what 's funny ?
by accident ?
y'know how i got started in the fight racket ?
ohh !
i just dislocated my finger .
absolutely .
but you never had a chance to prove yourself .
and you never got the chance ?
ai n't skated since i was fifteen -- that 's when i started fightin ' -- got ta watch the ankles . yeah , fightin ' use to be tops with me , but no more . all i wanted to prove was i were n't no bum -- that i had the stuff to make a good pro .
... are n't you skating ?
i think mebbe we 're early or somethin ' --
i think it 's closed .
looks quiet , y'know .
to you , to me it 's thursday .
it 's thanksgiving .
... goodnight , rocky .
hey , how 's my buddy doin ' ? -- nice dog -- well , i 'll see ya later .
shell-shocked !

good ? good , paulie ? ! i 've been treatin ' you like a baby . since i ca n't remember it 's so long -- i 'm the only one who feeds you an ' puts you in bed when ya ca n't stand up -- and it 's you that made me feel like a loser -- that 's what ya use to call me 'loser ' -- what kind of name is that ? so can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when i 'm with rocky -- i do n't owe you , paulie , you owe me .
you owe me an ' are supposed to treat me good !
owe you what ?
get away from me -- i could never even get married 'cause you could n't live by yaself -- ya 'd die by yaself ! so instead i put you two together -- did ya think of puttin ' in a good word for me ? -- you owe me !

he got lucky .
he 's movin ' to your left -- do n't let him no more -- dance and stick , hear ? do n't play -- i know what ya feelin ' , but do n't play .
... that man 's takin ' his job too serious .
people nothin ' , you in a fight , my man , -- ya best believe what you hear ... knock that boy out soon an ' let 's go home .
man , i rearranged his face with that right -- the people love what 's happenin ' tonight .
do n't play with this man , he 's fightin ' hard -- let 'em feel some real heat !
i 'll carry him 'till the third .
sure -- he can hit -- do n't play no more -- stick an ' move , hear ?
... that boy damn near broke my arm .
southpaw , nuthin ' -- i 'll drop 'im in three -- 'apollo creed meets the italian stallion . ' shhiii -- sounds like a damn monster movie ! !
i do n't like you messin ' with southpaws -- they do everything wrong .
listen , i gon na carry this boy three rounds , then drop 'im like a bad habit .
he wo n't last one round .
... i do n't feel heat from the name .
too old , dull fighter . bobby judge is a good boy .
give my main man a raise ! !
you 's the novelty , champ !
i do -- maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty .
do n't matter -- that name . 'the italian stallion , ' it 's right on . who discovered america ? an italian , right ? so , man , what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
rocky balboa -- his record 's poor --
'the italian stallion ' -- he 's my man .
... this man .
exactly what are you looking for , apollo ?
... still do n't feel no heat .
joe zack is a good prospect -- exciting boy .
how 'bout this big chuck smith ?
fouls .
how 'bout this billy snow ?
no , man , it 's very smart .
... it 's very american .
now here 's what 's goin ' down . listen , 'cause i 'm gon na say this but one time . on january first , the first day of the bicentennial i 'm gon na fight me a local poor underdog , dig ? a snow-white underdog . an ' i 'm gon na put his face on this poster with me , hear ? an ' i 'll tell you why , 'cause i 'm sentimental -- an ' all the people in the country all sentimental , man , an ' they 'd like nothin ' better than me , apollo creed , to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country 's biggest birthday . now that 's the way i see it an ' that 's the way i want it ! !
apollo , i 'm sure there 's a way to salvage this .
shape , nothin ' -- they 're afraid . they know everybody in the world 's gon na see this fight an ' none of them got ta prayer of beating me so they 're makin ' excuses so they do n't have to be the chump that 's gon na be whipped in front of the whole civilized world ! !
shaw 's fighting in south america -- why not postpone the bout until july fourth ?
then gim me buddy shaw -- he 's ranked fifth .
i contacted ernie roman 's manager , he 's fighting in france the same week .
you best find me another ranked contender an ' i mean in a flash , man !
i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green .
damn .
... stay in school an ' use your brains , dig -- be a lawyer , be a doctor , carry a leather briefcase an ' forget about sports ! ! sports can only make ya grunt an ' smell -- be a thinker not a stinker ! !
any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls ?
me an ' my wife are goin ' home 'cause we miss our children an ' ca n't go no more time without seein ' them .
where 're you off to now ?
the bicentennial heavyweight championship of the world is gon na be held in the only place it can be held -- philadelphia ! -- the nation 's cradle -- january first -- the first major event of our two hundredth year .
still to be held in philadelphia ?
that 's right -- it 's gon na be the greatest sportin ' event in this country 's history -- a gala occurrence !
you 're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight ?
he was big , an ' very nasty so i destroyed him in a hurry -- now i 'm gettin ' ready for mac lee green next month .
apollo , how would you rate this last british challenger , henry wilcoxson ?
very high an ' very fast .
how was the flight , champ ?
move your shoulders down .
kiss my ass .
do n't like yours neither .
i do n't like ya face .
does that bum have to say that ?
take 'er to the zoo -- retards like the zoo .
she ai n't retarded , she 's shy .
hear she 's retarded .
... of the truck that run over your face .
of wa ?
did ya get the license number ?
pull heat on me ? -- i 'll dent ya face !
we 'll kill you , man -- we got ta gun .
buy us some thunderbird , man .
... that 's an old one .
hey , give rocky a dime .
no dollar .
'cause we dig ya , man -- gim me a dollar .
why ?
yo , rock , gim me a dollar .
no wine .
c'mon , man , it 's cold , man .
... no wine -- bad for ya ' brain .
yo , rocks , buy us sum wine , man .
charge it .
... how 'bout for the cokes ?
i must be goin ' deaf 'cause i thought ya said , 'ten cents . '
that 's ten bucks .
yeah -- my ol ' man who was never the sharpest told me -- i were n't born with much brain so i better use my body .
here -- three minutes .
this guy is beautiful -- get the cokes .
cost ya a buck .
how 'bout some cokes ?
six !
it ai n't your fault -- i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight . that 's me fightin ' big baby crenshaw -- big baby was the size of an airplane an ' i broke my hands on his head -- i lost , but it 's a nice picture , do n't ya think ?
seven minutes !
hey , i ai n't cryin ' ... i still fight . kinda do it like a hobby . see i 'm a natural southpaw an ' most pugs wo n't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin ' an ' look awkward -- southpaw means lefthanded ... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best , right ?
nine minutes !
... yeah , give 'er the blades .
ten minutes for ten dollars .
... ten minutes .
few minutes ?
look at her , ya can see she ai n't feelin ' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
this a con ?
listen , i got ta problem . this girl ai n't feelin ' well , y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise , y'know once in awhile an ' ice skatin ' is the best thing --
yo , pal , what 's with you -- the place ai n't operatin ' .
wait here , got ta smooth this guy out .
hey , the rink is empty 'cause we 're closed -- ya ai n't allowed in here so do me a favor an ' not stay here .
are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody .
hey , whatta ya doin ' here -- we 're closed ... yo , we 're closed !
not only has he refused to fall , but he has beaten the champion 's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest .
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen -- the ringside audience is spotted with blood . this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall --
no way -- but the brilliant ability of the champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks rocky . creed on the offensive -- balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart ... that hurt .
there 's no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power .
apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations . balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creed 's temple -- not much movement from balboa , duck a left , a right , another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- i mean explodes . the champ backs off .
round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell .
if you had asked anyone who knows boxing , they never would 've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the champion ... most fighters will tell you , receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying .
creed is down ! ! !
the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money 's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination . i feel sorry for --
the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- creed does n't look the best he 's ever been but is moving smoothly -- creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner -- oh , a solid hook by creed , a master of fist-men .
i agree .
it 's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington -- a great way to start 1976 off .
am i seeing right ? creed is approaching the ring in a boat . is he supposed to be george washington ? obviously so .
you could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring --
i only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- vegas odds say , 'no . '
thank you , bob . the electricity is everywhere tonight . rocky balboa , a fifty-to-one underdog , is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples ' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine , 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier . ' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring ... his record is forty-four wins , twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts .
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year ... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world . i would like to welcome an old friend , and co-commentator for this evening 's event -- jimmy michaels .
not yellow , cautious . see , it 's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
yo ' yellow , old man .
do n't mouth me , old man , i 'll knock yo ' out too . c'mon , wop , spar me , let everybody see who 's got the heat around here .
why let rocky here take a chance on cuttin ' or breakin ' a hand ? -- take a shower , dipper .
yo ' know i iz the best man here ! yo ' said so yoself !
you can forget about sparring , kid .
i 'm happenin ' ! this pig is takin ' my shot -- i iz a contender . he 's nothin ' .
what 's happenin ' here ?
i say ya nothin ' !
waits ! -- be smart . ya do n't have to break nothin ' -- here , take my coat , it 's worth fifty-sixty dollars . it 's yours .
ya still light seventy .
i know the juice is climbin ' -- i been workin ' six months just to pay the damn interest .
... the juice is climbin ' every week .
you have my food in ya hand .
what about for food an ' stuff ?

bob .

mr. gazzo says i should get two hundred or break the thumb .
honest to god i 'm broke -- gim me a break .

where else am i gon na go . bet three grand on rocky .
yo , you gon na show , tony ?
same thing . ya know , rock , remember when we was kids , we fought together . an ' i was n't well an ' ya had to beat up that irish kid -- what 's his name ? -- gallager -- i bought a suit and became a businessman . you put on gloves . an ' i remember mama almost cried , may she rest in peace -- an ' our ol ' man who said ya had no brains -- i 'd like to lay hands on that bastard . you ai n't never had any luck . even when i owned you in '66 you never had luck . but now i think you might be gettin ' some luck kid . whatta you think ?

it do n't matter . it 's my reputation . these guys think they can get off light . it 's bad for my reputation -- it 's bad for business . see ya killer .
i figure if i break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and ca n't pay nothin ' no more .
yo rock . did i give you a job this mornin ? how come ya did n't break this guy 's thumb like i asked ya ? when ya do n't do what ya are told , it makes me look bad , kid .
... fine .
tomorrow collect from del rio -- he 's late three weeks . how 'd you do last night ?
sure , rocky , bob 's good for it ...
he only had a hundred an ' thirty . -- i think he 's good for the rest next week , mr. gazzo .
not spar , i 'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship .
sure , an ' i 'm smart enough to know that no sparrin ' partner should take cheap shots at the champ . he 's just there to help condition the man .
did you hear what i said ?
... like i said , i 'd make a boss sparrin ' mate .
rocky , would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship ?
i would n't take no cheap shots . i 'd be a good sparrin ' partner .
what ?
absolutely -- sparrin ' with the champ would be an honor -- y'know what ?
i 'm sure you are .
i know ya need sparrin ' partners -- i 'm very available .
excuse me .
sparrin ' ?
rocky , would you be interested in --
no -- just me .
rocky , do you have any representation ? a manager ?
rocky .
mr. balboa --

yo , a bad reputation -- twenty years from now people will say 'd'you remember marie ? ' 'no , who was she ? ' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop . ' 'oh , now i remember ! ' ... see , they do n't remember you , they remember the rep .
what ?
that does n't matter -- you do n't really have to be a whore , just act like one an ' that 's it .
c'mon , rocky . i 'm twelve .
'cause that 's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty . they think ya cute for a while , but then ya getta reputation an ' watch out . nobody 's ever gon na take ya serious . ya get no respect ... i got ta use a bad word -- whore . you 'll end up maybe becomin ' a whore .
why ?
nobody likes garbage -- anyway , this girl with the dirty mouth was n't bad lookin ' , but the guys would n't take her out for any serious datin ' .
maybe i like garbage .
makes your breath like garbage .

if ya was wantin ' my help , why did n't ya ask ? just ask .
whatever i got , i always got on the slide . this shot 's no different . i did n't earn nothin ' -- i got it on the slide ... i needed ya help about ten years ago when i was startin ' , but ya never helped me none .

your sister 's givin ' me the shoulder .
what ?
yo , paulie .
yo , rocky -- look at this mirror . i 'd like to kill the friggin ' moron who broke this mirror .
yo , paulie .
derogatory ? yeah , he 's great .
do you have anything derogatory to say about the champion ?
i 'll tear his head off .
maybe --
do you feel you have a chance ?
apollo 's a great fighter .
we can cut that out later . apollo creed says he 'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away .
how 're you preparing for this bicentennial bout ?
... people talk to me more .
so much has happened lately -- has it changed your life style much ?
listen , i wan na say hi to my girlfriend -- yo , adrian !
and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . any comment ?
four hundred -- but that was a long time ago .
is it true the most you 've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars ?
creed 's great , ai n't he ... i 'll do what i can .
how will you fight apollo creed ?
feel ? i dunno ... happy .
this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it ?
so what 's your next move , valiant ?
well , i 'll be ...
no . but neither does roger . that 's diablo red . roger 's pants are sunrise orange .
my problem is i got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie .
oh , a ladies man , huh ?
yeah ...
you serve martinis , doncha ?
we do n't serve formula . snookums .
yeah ? does he wear pants this color ?
my hunch is it was maroon . he always was after acme 's property .
somebody took it from him . that 's what this whole thing 's about .
so where is it then ?
and another thing , the paper said no will was found . but every toon knows acme had a will and , in it he promised to leave toontown to the toons .
c'mon , valiant , does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? i mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place ?
my problem is i come here to drink in peace . so if you do n't mind ...
you do n't believe that . i mean . the guy 's an idiot , a moron , a complete fool ... but he 'd never kill anyone . i know the guy .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
yeah , i had to go slummin ' . see , a friend of mine 's bein ' framed .
i know who you are . kinda out of your neighborhood , are n't you ?
make it dry . baby does n't like to be wet . you 're valiant , right ? the name 's baby herman .
sounds like you ve never seen her , eddie .
big on the musical comedy , huh ?
he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit .
shoulda guessed .
that 's marvin acme , the gag king .
yeah , you still got it , betty . who 's mr. jocularity ?
work 's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color . but i still got it , eddie ... 'boop boop be-doop ' .
wish i could say the same . what 're you doin ' here , betty ?
gee , it 's swell to see you , eddie . we miss you in toontown .
i 'm not worried about you . i 'm worried about the safe .
do n't worry about me . i can take it .
i 've already dropped it on you twenty-three times .
please , raoul . i can give you stars , i know i can . just drop the safe on my head one more time .
that 's right , a tweeting bird . but what does the script say ? 'rabbit gets conked . rabbit sees < u > stars < /u > ! ' not birds , stars !
a tweeting bird ?
what 's this , roger ?
familiar . be careful , eddie .
that 'll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i 'll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?
yeah ... they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
what 've i got to lose ? you okay , dolores ?
are you gon na call him , eddie ?
i 'll bet .
i was hopin ' you 'd be there . maroon 's called here about four times . he says he 's got ta talk to you tonight . he says he can help you .
oh , no ...
sounds like singin ' .
what 's that comin ' from the bar ?
got me . but unless the will shows up by friday midnight , it 's theirs .
what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
nope . it 's that cloverleaf outfit again .
maroon , right ?
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate .
probably lookin ' for a good place to stick a knife .
the rabbit 's wife ? wan na tell me what she was doin ' with her arms around you ?
< u > that < /u > was the rabbit 's wife .
what was < u > that < /u > ?
yeah , do that . i 'm gon na go rattle maroon 's cage .
eddie , you still got it . hey , tomorrow maybe i 'll go down to probate court and see who 's sniffin ' around acme 's estate ?
then why 'd they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it wo n't open .
maybe they just took it out of his pocket .
maybe baby herman was right . somebody wants acme 's property . cack the old man , pin it on roger , and destroy the will .
so what 's the scam , eddie ?
if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this .
can you get him out of it , eddie ?
i oughta have my head examined . will you hold still ?
so you decided to help him after all ?
it 's all yours .
oh , yeah ? well , you 're not handcuffed to him . anybody in the back room ?
he 's a riot .
dolores , meet roger rabbit .
jesus , eddie , is this who i think it is ?
he 's a toon ... who cares ?
so you 're not even gon na bother to find out if the rabbit 's gettin ' framed ?
stick to stuffin ' the olives , willya , dolores ?
the papers said the safe door was opened , eddie .
thanks for the vote of confidence .
yeah , eddie , it 's not like you got an ad in the yellow pages .
i do n't wan na think . i wan na drink .
do you think the rabbit did it ?
bastards put him on notice .
no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?
a new outfit bought the red car . some big company called cloverleaf industries .
what are you complaining about ? here 's your fifty bucks .
hey , eddie , looks like you really stepped in it this time .
r.k. maroon .
check the scrawl .
is this paper even good ?
you 'll have it in the morning . now be a sport and lem me have twenty bucks to put in my pocket .
this is fifty bucks . i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow .
would this be the same dame who 's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i 've got her money .
so , makin ' dame jokes , huh , eddie ? well , lem me remind ya pal , it was a < u > dame < /u > who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump . and it was a < u > dame < /u > who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would . and it 's a < u > dame < /u > who 's tired of waitin ' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job !
that 's right , me .
you ?
not really . only a toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea .
surprised ?
holy shit , he 's a toon !
not for long . we 're retiring the red cars . people will drive , mr. valiant , because they 'll have to . and when they drive , they 'll have to buy our cars , our tires , our gasoline .
that 's what this is all about ? tell me , who 's gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
a freeway , mr. valiant , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l.a. to pasadena . pasadena to hollywood . hollywood to santa monica . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l.a. basin to another .
what the hell 's a freeway ?
right here where we 're standing , will be the cornerstone of my idea ... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways .
they wo n't care . who 's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?
it was n't toontown they wanted . it was my idea of how to put the land to better use .
come on , doom . what would a company like that want with toontown ?
no one person is cloverleaf . we 're a vast company with diverse interests ... gasoline , tires , automobiles .
so you 're cloverleaf ?
no matter . i do n't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes . by then cloverleaf will own toontown quite legally .
i 've had enough of your insolence ! put him in my car . i think they 'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the acme factory .
the pot 's callin ' the kettle maniacal .
these roads can be very treacherous at night , especially in a maniacal toon vehicle .
yeah ? well , do n't expect the toons to give you a gold watch .
well , why not ? i 'm feeling magnanimous tonight . the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . i 'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector .
yes , and for that you 're charged with aiding and abetting . but we 'll let santino handle that .
i do n't think it 's gon na matter . sorry , pal , i tried .
you 're a very stubborn man , mr. valiant . very pig-headed . boys , show mr. valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station ...
i ai n't tellin ' you nothin ' ! get me santino .
indeed we are . we 'll continue the interrogation there .
you 're not takin ' me to downtown < u > toon < /u > town ?
oh , not < u > that < /u > downtown . < u > toon < /u > town .
downtown ? fine . get a hold of santino , i 'd be more than glad to talk to him .
take it easy , bongo . we 'll handle mr. valiant our own way ... downtown .
the other people who were in here lookin ' for the will . i woulda caught 'em if cheetah here had n't interrupted me .
they ?
they must 've taken it off me .
he had a will , all right . she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off . then she set up her loving husband to take the fall .
marvin acme had no will . i should know , the probate is in my court .
ask her ...
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective . what were you looking for , mr. valiant ?
have you tried walla walla ? kokomo 's very nice this time of year .
so you would n't have any idea where he might be ?
why would he contact me ? i just took some lousy pictures .
yes , i find that weasles have a special gift for the work . the rabbit did n't contact you by any chance , did he ?
men ? they look more like weasles to me .
hey , pal , do i look like a stenographer ?
yes , we talked to mr. maroon . he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures , and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back . is that true ?
he 's not my client . i was workin ' for r.k. maroon .
uh , eddie , do me a favor . could you sit in the back so you wo n't cause as much of a commotion .
not much . it 's hard to talk .
does it hurt ?
no ...
you 're a pig ... a happy-go-lucky pig .
what am i , earl ?
boy , i 'll say . they gave you a real toon-a-roo .
toon cops worked me over .
eddie ? jesus , what happened ?
earl ... it 's me , valiant .
here 's one for the books ... a toon wearin ' human clothes .
eddie , come on .
hold on a second .
he made me laugh .
lem me guess where you got that from . tell me somethin ' , what 'd you ever see in that guy anyway ?
looks like our goose is cooked , our hash is slung , our fait is accompli ...
a joker to the end .
when i opened up the blue envelope , all that was inside was a blank piece of paper .
so where is it ?
marvin told me . doom was after his land . ne was afraid . that 's why he brought me his will .
how did you get onto doom ?
he 's right here in the ...
where is he ?
we 're even . by the way , i did find your husband .
i did n't know who i could trust .
why did n't you tell me ?
it was doom who killed acme , you know ?
do n't worry , you 're not the first . we better get out of here .
lady , i guess i had you pegged wrong .
that 's not roger . it 's one of doom 's men . he killed r.k. maroon .
you shot roger .
if i 'm as bad as you think , what 's stopping me from just killing you right now ?
cause i do n't take acme dumb pills . i do n't know what you 're up to , lady , but i 'm gon na nail you for the acme murder .
it 's the truth . why wo n't you believe it ?
so altruistic .
i 'm not complainin ' . but give me credit . i 'm the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
i 'm not bad , i 'm just drawn that way .
yeah , well , you do n't know how hard it is bein ' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do .
oh , please do n't make fun of me , mr , valiant . you do n't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do .
oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .
no , no , no ... i love my husband .
yeah , i 'll bet you would . you got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .
you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything .
no ? i guess we 're not counting lying , stealing and murder .
toons are n't given imperfections .
come on , lady , have n't you ever seen a mole before ?
okay , you 've seen me . now give me a towel .
oh ... well , i ... i just had to see you .
that 's because i do n't have a doorbell .
hello , mr. valiant . i rang the doorbell , but i guess you could n't hear it .
look , doll , if i wanted underwear , i woulda broken into frederick 's of hollywood . i was lookin ' for marvin acme 's will .
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir . maybe that 's what he was after ?
jesus christ ... < u > that < /u > was the judge ?
doom .
what the hell is that ?
that 's how he gets rid of the troublemakers . it 's a combination of acetone , turpentine and paint remover . he calls it the ... final solution .
what 's with the dip ?
no one knows . he bought the election a few years back . he 's been rulin ' toontown ever since .
where 'd this gargoyle come from anyway ?
wait here ...
what a gasser .
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin ' the other day .
just have n't been this close to toontown for awhile .
now what ?
that 's what you woke me up for ?
tell me you did n't do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit .
there 's no time to take it easy ! you do n't realize the diabolical mind we 're dealing with !
take it easy .
you tricked me , damn you !
no , i do n't .
you got the will in there , do n't ya ?
no , you got ta understand , valiant , i had nothin ' to do with acme gettin ' killed . i just wanted to sell my studio . but they would n't buy my property unless acme would sell his . and he would n't . so i was gon na blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit 's wife .
well , everybody needs a hobby .
no ... i 'm not . i 'm a cartoon maker , not a murderer .
you 're not too good at this , are you , r.k. ?
that was the idea .
valiant ! you surprised me .
stop what ?
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock . if you 've got the will maybe we can stop this thing .
maybe . why ?
have you got the will ?
maroon ? whaddaya want ?
yeah , but i enlarged this one . thought you might be interested .
i 've already seen your photographs .
i just thought i 'd drop by and show you a photograph .
valiant ? what 're you doin ' here ?
hi , mr. maroon . remember me ?
sure , valiant , sure ...
son-of-a-bitch ... mr. maroon , i think i 'll be goin ' now , so about the rest of my fee ...
frankly , i 'm shocked . marvin acme 's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years .
well , you better start thinkin ' about drinkin ' it black .
as soon as is humanly possible .
when will i hear from you ?
are n't you the lucky one ...
i got him on loan from disney .
so 's the job .
a hundred bucks ? that 's ridiculous .
the job 's gon na cost you a hundred bucks .
you do n't have to . the rabbit 's wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink & paint club . you can catch her in action there .
i do n't work in toontown .
get me a couple juicy pictures . somethin ' i can wise the rabbit up with .
so what do you want me to do ?
here 's the problem ... `` seen cooing over calamari with notsonew sugar daddy was jessica rabbit ... wife of maroon star , roger '' . his wife 's a tramp , but he thinks she 's betty crocker . the doubt 's eatin ' him up .
nah , that goes with the territory . he 's a stunt bunny .
one too many safes dropped on his head ?
yeah , and there 's no business as expensive . i 'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it 's all because that rabbit ca n't keep his mind on his work . and you know why ?
only there 's no business like it , no business i know .
how much do you know about show business , valiant ?
so what ? he 's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule !
he was blowin ' his lines , all right . so what ?
valiant , did you see the rabbit ?
from this box here ...
pretty good cigar . where 'd you get it ?
only time will tell .
and i 'm glad you got your sense of humor back . think you 'll keep it ?
by the way , roger , you were right about your wife . she 's a good lady . i 'm glad you got her back .
i guess i am at that . cigar ?
no , kid , you 're a real hero .
hey , it 's the will . i , marvin acme , of sound mind and body , hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters ...
keep reading ...
good idea .
i think you oughta read it to her .
yeah ?
say roger , remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the ink & paint club ?
yeah ...
that 's because it 's disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up three days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . great gag .
that 's not blood . that 's ink . that goof acme squirted me with some the other day . why it 's comin ' 'through now , i do n't know .
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage .
real good , rog ... but maybe you better let me take over .
i followed you to the maroon studios . when i heard those shots , i thought i 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk .
what the hell are you doin ' in there ?
... i 'd head for cucamonga .
yeah ?
if i do n't make it back here by ten ...
i rest my case .
two bits .
how much is a shave and a haircut , roger ?
you know , eddie , i 'm not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
forget it .
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you .
that 's why i 'll be there at 8:45 .
gee , eddie , you 're not gon na go , are ya ? maroon 'll be layin ' for ya at nine o'clock .
no , it 's not .
wrong number ?
get away from there .
i 'll get it .
piano . guy got away , disappeared into toontown . nobody ever saw him again .
safe ?
yeah , everybody thought so . but me and teddy got a kick out of toons . all toons . we could n't see the bad in 'em . and when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the first national bank of toontown , we took his case . but when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . we went to his house to take him in . but he was wise . he got the drop on us ... literally .
him ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable ... a smear on the drafting board .
yeah , a toon . it was the guy who killed bambi 's mother .
a toon ? noooo .
you wan na know ? well , since you 're so goddamn curious , i 'll tell ya . one of you toons killed my brother .
gee , you shamuses are a tough audience , but what happened to you that was so dark , lurid , embittering ?
you damn toon ! no wonder they picked you for the patsy . always got ta play the fool . you make me sick !
what is this , twenty questions ?
gee , i did n't recognize you ... i 've never seen you laugh before . that your brother makin ' the rabbit ears ?
me .
say , who 's this guy laughin ' ?
we ca n't do anything till it 's dark .
so what 's our plan , our scenario , our modus operandi ?
my brother . get inside .
valiant and valiant ? who 's the other valiant ?
if i 'm so smart , how come i 'm runnin ' from the law with a toon ?
oh , eddie , that was quick thinkin ' . nothin ' like usin ' the old noggin , the noodle , the grey matter ...
drink it , jerk . all of it .
but , eddie , you know what happens when ...
here you go , kid ... say hi to casper for me .
i think you want a drink . how about it , judge ?
a blindfold , cigarette , noseplugs ? just kidding .
hey , does n't the rabbit even get a last request ?
well , right now it 's gon na be your funereal .
i 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively funereal !
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety .
a laugh can be a powerful thing , eddie . sometimes it 's the only weapon we have in life .
just because you got 'em to laugh ?
well ... i still do n't think he 'd turn me in .
an arsonist and a kidnapper . he just got outta prison .
angelo ? he 's a pal , a chum ...
and when they 're done laughin ' , they 're gon na call the cops . that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel !
but that 's my calling , my purpose , my raison d'etre . toons are supposed to make people laugh ... and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
why , you crazy toon ... i 've been out there riskin ' my neck for you . i come back here and you 're singin ' and dancin ' .
hey , do n't i get an encore ?
because he 's not forty feet tall . the safe was up on the ceiling , remember ?
well , mr. smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?
well , acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club . it was gone in the morning when the cops found the body .
how do you know that ?
yeah . except they screwed up . i do n't think they got the will .
the habeus corpus is thickening .
your wife may be a lot of things , pal , but innocent is n't one of them .
i resent that innuendo ! my wife is completely innocent .
yeah . i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind , your wife the sound body .
yeah ... well you just might get your wish .
my philosophy is if you do n't have a sense of humor , you 're better off dead .
are you always this funny , or only on days when you 're wanted for murder ?
well , no , not < u > any < /u > time . only when it was funny .
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time ?
yeah , that 's better .
does this help ?
do n't ever forget that .
sorry , eddie , i forgot you 're not a toon .
hey ! what do you think you 're doin ' ?
you idiot . i lost the key for those cuffs .
eddie valiant ... you 're under arrest ! just kidding ...
gee , eddie , i 'm a rabbit . we always run .
if you 're so innocent , why 'd you run ?
do n't do that ! i 'm innocent i tell ya . the police 'll just dip me . they were waitin ' for me when i got home last night . i ran .
look , pal , if you 're still here when i finish this drink , i 'm callin ' the police .
in other words , the whole goddamn world knows you 're here ! out ! get out !
well , i asked the newsboy on the corner . he did n't know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .
oh , yeah ? then how 'd you find my house ?
do n't worry , eddie , no one knows i 'm here .
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
i needed a place to hide . i 'm in trouble , eddie .
what the hell are you doin ' ?
aah !
aah !
divorce ? never !
my advice ? hop on over to reno , get yourself a quickie divorce .
baker 's man ... but no use ruinin ' a good pair of shoes over it .
pattycake ! pattycake !
uh ? uh ?
no better ?
if you do , sir , i am for you . i serve as good a man as you .
quarrel sir ! no , sir .
[ aside to gregory ] is the law on our side , if i say ay ?
do you bite your thumb at us ? sir .
i do bite my thumb , sir !
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
i will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
boo ! ah , ha ha . ooh . boo ! ha ha ha .
tempt not a desperate man !
then i 'll leave thee .
live and be prosperous ; and farewell good fellow .
tush , thou art deceived . hast thou no letters to me from the priest ? [ balthsasr shakes his head no . ] no matter . well , juliet , i will lie with thee tonight . i will hence tonight .
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure .
leave me !
have patience !
then i defy you , stars ! juliet ! juliet ! i will hence tonight .
if she is well then nothing can be ill. her body rests in capel 's monument , and her immortal part with the angel 's lives . i saw her laid low . pardon me for bringing these ill news .
men 's eyes were made to look , and let them gaze . i will not budge for no man 's pleasure , i .
either withdraw unto some private place , or reason coldly of your grievences , or else depart . here all eyes gaze on us .
by my heel , i care not .
by my head here come the capulets .
thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in verona .
am i like such a fellow ?
keep away the cats ! thou art like one of these fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says , & quot ; god send me no need of thee. & quot ; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
the what ?
more than prince of cats . he is the courageous captain of compliments . he fights as you sing prick- song , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; he rests his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause : the immortal passado ! punto reverso ! the hai !
why , what is tybalt ?
but alas poor romeo ! he is already dead ; stabbed with a white wench 's black eye ; shot through the ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?
nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
romeo will answer it ?
a challenge , on my life .
tybalt , the kinsman of old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father 's house .
why that pale hard-hearted wench , that rosaline . torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
not to his father 's ; i spoke with his man .
where the devil should this romeo be ? came he not home to-night ?
romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! i conjure thee by rosaline 's bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh ! o , romeo that she were an open ass , and thou a poperin pear ! romeo , good night : i 'll to my truckle-bed ; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep .
romeo ! romeo !
art thou hurt ?
forbear this outrage , good mercutio .
i fear , too early : for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night 's revels and expire the term of a despised life closed within my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death . but he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail ! on , lusty gentlemen .
this wind , you talk of , blows us from ourselves ; supper is done , and we shall come too late .
but 't is no wit to go .
every man betake him to his legs .
not mad , but bound more than a mad-man is ; shut up in prison , kept without my food , whipp 'd and tormented . good day , good fellow .
by giving liberty unto thine eyes ; examine other beauties . why , romeo , art thou mad ?
teach me how i should forget to think .
be ruled by me , forget to think of her .
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste .
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
well , in that hit you miss : she 'll not be hit with cupid 's arrow ; nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold :
a right fair mark , fair cuz , is soonest hit .
a right good marks-man ! and she 's fair i love .
i aim 'd so near , when i supposed you loved .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
soft ! i will go along ; an if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
farewell , my cuz .
at thy good heart 's oppression .
good heart , at what ?
no , cuz , i rather weep .
alas , that love , whose view is muffled still , should , without eyes , see pathways to his will ! where shall we dine ? o me ! what fray was here ? yet tell me not , for i have heard it all . here 's much to do with hate , but more with love . why , then , o brawling love ! o loving hate ! o any thing , of nothing first create ! o heavy lightness ! serious vanity ! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms ! feather of lead -- [ benvolio snickers ] dost thou not laugh ?
alas , that love , so gentle in his view , should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !
out of her favour , where i am in love .
of love ?
out --
in love ?
not having that , which , having , makes them short .
it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ?
ay me ! sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ?
but new struck cuz .
is the day so young ?
good-morrow , cousin .
why then , o brawling love , o loving hate , o anything of nothing first create . heavy lightness . serious vanity . misshapen chaos of well seeming forms .
go to ! what , goodman boy ! i say , he shall : go to ; make a mutiny among my guests ? !
uncle , 't is a shame .
he shall be endured
i 'll not endure him .
content thee , gentle cuz , content thee . let him alone ; i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement : therefore be patient , take no note of him
't is he .
young romeo is it ?
uncle , this is that villain romeo , a montague , our foe .
why , how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ?
what dares the slave come hither , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead , i hold it not a sin .
here is my gold . worse poison to men 's souls , than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell .
drink it off and , if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight .
i pay thy poverty , and not thy will .
my poverty , but not my will consents .
the world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
such mortal drugs i have , but verona 's law is death to any that utters them .
what if this mixture do not work at all ? shall i be married then tomorrow morning ?
i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent . if , rather than to marry paris , thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death , to chide away this shame . no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest . each part , deprived of supple government , shall stiff and stark and cold appear , like death . now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead . thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie . in the meantime , against thou shalt awake , shall romeo by my letters know our drift , and hither shall he come . and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua . take thou this vial , being then in bed , and this distilling liquor drink thou off . i 'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua .
be not so long to speak i long to die .
hold daughter !
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this i 'll help it presently !
it strains me past the compass of my wits .
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter now . we must entreat the time alone .
are you at leisure holy father , now ? or shall i come to you at evening mass ?
and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor . ah me , how sweet is love itself possessed when but love 's shadow 's are so rich in joy . news from verona . how now , balthasar ? ! dost thou not bring me letters from the priest ? how doth my lady ? is my father well ? how doth my lady juliet ? for nothing can be ill if she be well .
as the custom is , in all her best array , bear her to church .
farewell .
hie you make haste ! but look thou stay not till the watch be set , for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage , reconcile your friends , beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy , than thou wentst forth in lamentation . quick hence ! be gone by break of day ! sojourn in mantua .
how well my comfort is revived by this .
o deadly sin , o rude unthankfulness ! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not . hence !
there is no world without verona walls , hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death . then banished is death mis-termed . calling death banished , thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me .
affliction is enamoured of thy parts , and thou art wedded to calamity . hence from verona art thou banished . be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
banishment ? be merciful , say death ; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death . do not say banishment .
wisely and slow ; they stumble that run fast .
o , let us hence ; i stand on sudden haste .
o , she new well . thy love read by rote and could not spell . come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i 'll thy assistant be ; for this alliance may so happy prove , to turn you household rachor to pure love .
i pray thee , chde me not ; whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow ; the other did not so .
for doting ; not for loving , pupil mine .
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline .
holy saint francis , what a change is here ! is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken ? young men 's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes .
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set , on the fair daughter of rich capulet . we met , we wooed , we made exchange of vow . i 'll tell thee as we pass ; but this i pray , that thou consent to marry us today .
be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
i have been feasting with mine enemy , where on a sudden one hath wounded me , that 's by me wounded ; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies .
that 's my good son : but where hast thou been
rosaline ? my ghostly father no ; i have forgot that name , and that name 's woe .
god pardon sin , was thou with rosaline ! ?
the last is true ; the sweeter rest was mine .
young son , it argues a distemper 'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed : or if not so so , then here i hit it right , our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight .
benedicite ! what early tounge so sweet saludeth me ?
good marrow , father !
sir , a ring my lady bid me give you .
i thought thy disposition better tempered ! thy juliet is alive . there art thou happy . the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile . there art thou happy . a pack of blessings light upon thy back . wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth ? since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once .
romeo , come forth .
where is my lady 's lord ?
welcome .
i come for my lady juliet .
o , mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants , herbs , stones , and their true qualities : for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give , nor aught so good , but strain 'd from that fair use revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse : virtue itself turns vice , being misaplied ; and vice sometimes by action dignified . within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power : for this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ; being tasted , slays all senses with the heart . two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs , grace and rude will ; and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
juliet !
romeo , i drink to thee .
goodnight .
farewell . god knows when we shall meet again .
geth thee to be and rest , for thou has need .
no , madam . we have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow . so please you , let me now be left alone , and let the nurse this night sit up with you . for i am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business .
what , daughter are you busy ? need you my help ?
o god ! -- o nurse , how shall this be prevented ? what sayest thou ? hast thou not a word of joy ? some comfort nurse .
talk not to me , for ill not speak a word . do as thou wilt for i have done with thee .
o sweet my mother cast me not away . delay this marriage for a month , a week . or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .
here comes your father , tell him so yourself .
what ? now . st. peter 's church , and peter too , he shall not make me there a joyful bride !
marry my child next thursday morn . the gallant , young and noble gentleman , sir paris , at saint peter 's church , shall make thee there a joyful bride .
madam , in happy time what day is that ?
thou hast a careful father , child : one who , to put thee from thy heaviness , hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor i looked not for .
she 'll not come down tonight .
o god . did romeo 's hand shed tybalt 's blood ? o serpent heart hid with a flowering face . was ever book containing such vile matter 's so fairly bound ? o , that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace .
well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much . go in and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father to father lawrence to make confession and be absolved .
what ?
amen
and from my soul too . else beshrew them both .
speakest thou from thy heart ?
faith , here it is . i think it best you marry with this paris . o , he 's a lovely gentleman . i think you are happy in this second match , for it excels your first ; or if it did not , your first is dead -- or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him .
then hie you hence to father laurence ' cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife
i have .
have you got leave to go to confession to-day ?
here 's such a coil ! come , what says romeo ?
o lady dear ! are you so hot ? henceforward do your messages yourself .
where is my mother ! how oddly thou repliest ! your love says , like an honest gentleman , where is your mother ? '
your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , i warrant , a virtuous , -- where is your mother ?
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
lord , how my head aches ! what a head have i ! o , my back ! other ' other side , -- o , my back .
but all this did i know before . what says he of our marriage ? what of that ?
well , you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man : romeo ! no , not he ; though his face be better than any man 's , yet his leg excels all men 's ; and for a hand , and a foot , and a body ,
how art thou out of breath , when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ? is the news good , or bad ? answer to that ;
what haste ? can you not stay awhile ? do you not see that i am out of breath ?
i would thou hadst my bones , and i thy news : i pray thee , speak .
i am a-weary , give me leave awhile : fie , how my bones ache ! what a jaunt have i !
o honey nurse , what news ? nurse ?
by and by , i come : -- to cease thy strief , and leave me to my grief : to-morrow will i send .
[ within ] juliet !
i uh , by and by i come -- but if thou mean'st not well , i do beseech thee --
[ within ] juliet !
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word to-morrow , by one that i 'll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
juliet !
madam , i am here . what is your will ?
i bade her come . god forbid ! juliet ! juliet ! juliet !
thus ... .. with a kiss ... ... i die .
romeo . what 's here ? poison . drunk all , and left no friendly drop to help me after . i will kiss thy lips . happily some poison yet doth hang on them . thy lips are warm .
o god , i have an ill-divining soul . methinks i see thee , now thou art so low , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb . o fortune , fortune . be fickle , fortune , for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back .
i doubt it not . trust me , love , all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come . adieu .
then window , let day in and let life out . o , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
more light and light , more dark and dark our woes .
it is , it is ! hie hence , be gone , away . o , now be gone . more light and light it grows .
let me be taken , let me be put to death . i have more care to stay then will to go . come death , welcome , juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let us talk it is not day .
that light is not daylight , i know it , i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua . therefore stay yet . thou needest not be gone .
i must be gone and live , or stay and die .
wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day .
mercutio 's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company !
come gentle night . come loving black-browned night give me my romeo . and when i shall die , take him and cut him out into little stars , and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun . o , i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed , and though i am sold , not yet enjoyed . o , tedious is this day , as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .
i will not fail : 't is twenty year till then .
by the hour of nine .
romeo ! at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee ?
a thousand times the worse , to want thy light . love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books , but love from love , toward school with heavy looks .
a thousand times good night ! exit , above
so thrive my soul --
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it !
the exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine .
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
do not swear : although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract to-night : it is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden ; too like the lightning , which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens . ' sweet , good night ! this bud of love , by summer 's ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . good night .
if my heart 's dear love --
do not swear at all ; or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i 'll believe thee .
well what shall i swear by ?
o , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circled orb , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
lady , by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops --
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment ! dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say 'ay , ' and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st , thou mayst prove false . o gentle romeo , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully :
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes , and but thou love me , let them find me here : my life were better ended by their hate , than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .
with love 's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls ; for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt ; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
how camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ? the garden walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .
neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .
art thou not romeo and a montague ?
ahhh !
i take thee at thy word .
't is but thy name that is my enemy ; thou art thyself , though not a montague . what 's montague ? it is nor hand , nor foot , nor arm , nor face , nor any other part belonging to a man . o , be some other name ! what 's in a name ? that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet ; so romeo would , were he not romeo call 'd , retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title . o romeo , doff thy name , and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself .
[ aside ] shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ?
romeo , o romeo ! wherefore art thou romeo ? deny thy father and refuse thy name ; or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , and i 'll no longer be a capulet .
she speaks : o , speak again , bright angel !
ay me !
he jests at scars that never felt a wound . but , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? it is the east , and juliet is the sun . arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou her maid art far more fair than she : be not her maid , since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it ; oh cast it off . it is my lady , o , it is my love ! o , that she knew she were !
you kiss by the book .
sin from my lips ? o trespass sweetly urged ! give me my sin again .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .
then move not , while my prayer 's effect i take . thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss .
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
go ! we follow thee . juliet , blah !
speak briefly , can you like of paris ' love ?
nay , bigger ; women grow by men .
this night you shall behold him at our feast ; read o'er the volume of young paris ' face , and find delight writ there with beauty 's pen ; this precious book of love , this unbound lover , to beautify him , only lacks a cover : so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him , making yourself no less .
nay , he 's a flower ; in faith , a very flower .
verona 's summer hath not such a flower .
a man , young lady ! lady , such a man as all the world- -why , he 's a man of wax .
by my count , i was your mother much upon these years , you are now a maid . thus then in brief : the valiant paris seeks you for his love .
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed .
nurse , give leave awhile , we must talk in secret . nurse , come back again ; i have remember 'd me , thou 's hear our counsel . nurse , thou know'st my daughter 's of a pretty age .
no ! mercutio !
a plague o ' both your houses .
i thought all for the best .
'twill serve . ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man . a plague o ' both your houses . they have made worms meat of me . a plague on both your houses ! why the devil did you come between us ? i was hurt under your arm .
courage man , the hurt can not be much .
ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch . ay , a scratch , a scratch . ha ha ha .
farewell , ancient lady ; farewell ,
i will follow you .
here 's goodly gear !
sure witt ! now art thou sociable , now art thou romeo ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature .
why , then is my pump well flowered .
right .
pink for flower .
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
a most courteous exposition .
thou hast most kindly hit it .
meaning , to court'sy .
that 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
pardon , good mercutio , my business was great ; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .
the slip , son , the slip ; can you not conceive ?
good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ?
signior romeo , bon jour ! there 's a french salutation to your french slop . you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
ho ho , capital punks !
ay , so i fear ; the more is my unrest .
away , begone ; the sport is at the best .
true , i talk of dreams , which are the children of an idle brain , begot of nothing but vain fantasy , which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind , who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north , and , being anger 'd , puffs away from thence , turning his face to the dew- dropping south .
peace , good mercutio , peace ! thou talk'st of nothing .
o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you . she is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies over men 's noses as they lie asleep ; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat , and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; o'er lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again . this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage : this is she -- this is she !
in bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
that dreamers often lie .
well , what was yours ?
and so did i .
i dream 'd a dream to-night .
why , may one ask ?
if love be rough with you , be rough with love ; prick love for pricking , and you beat love down .
is love a tender thing ? it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
too great oppression for a tender thing .
under love 's heavy burden do i sink .
you are a lover ; borrow cupid 's wings , and soar with them above a common bound .
not i , not i believe me : you have dancing shoes with nimble soles : i have a soul of lead
young hearts run free . never be caught up , caught up like rosaline and thee . nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance .
i am for you .
good king of cat 's , nothing but one of your nine lives .
what wouldst thou have with me ?
calm , dishonorable , vile submission ! thou art my souls hate ! tybalt ! you ratcatcher , will you walk ?
consort ? what does thou make us minstrels ? an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords . here 's my fiddlestick . here 's that shall make you dance ! zounds , consort !
mercutio ! thou art consortest with romeo ?
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir . and you will give me occasion .
oh , and but one word with one of us ? couple it with something . make it a word and a ... a blow .
follow me close . gentlemen , gooday . a word with one of you ?
as if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her , as that name 's cursed hand did murder her kinsman .
o , she says nothing sir , but weeps and weeps , and then on romeo cries and then falls down again .
sir . ah , sir . death the end of all
nurse .
bid her to come to confession this afternoon ; and there she shall at father laurence ' cell be shrived and married .
if ye should lead her into a fool 's paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say : for the lady is young ; and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing , and very weak dealing .
his name is romeo , and he 's a montague ; the only son of your great enemy .
is she a capulet ?
madam , your mother craves a word with you . come lets away .
as my american friend larry would say : are you fucking deaf ? it 's under your seat .
what ?
it 's under your seat .
to make a point . i do n't know her , and i was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk . i do n't particularly like you , so imagine what i 'll do if you try anything ...
why did you do that ?
you know it is .
do you really think so ?
this is important .
always in a rush , you are . all these years i 've known you , you could never wait for anything .
do you have it ?
i 'm up for that ...
i do n't know . i was thinking ... maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire , that sort of thing .
so where do you go from here ?
only the stupid ones . cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets . besides , i 'm not ira no more .
i do n't want you dead , woman , i want the the truth !
you go shoot me if you want , vincent , but you 'll be dead before i hit the ground .
and i do n't believe you ...
well i do n't !
when this whole thing started you made it clear : you 're running the show . and i do n't believe you 'd be running this show if you did n't know what was going on .
i do n't know .
finding this package is a thing easier said than done . we do n't even know what it is . what did we steal ?
of course .
very good . now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid .
and then sam , you and i clean up whatever 's left to be cleaned .
leaving ...
while sam and i take out the back two cars ...
is that right ?
we kept it ...
of course .
coordinate all you want , but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me . are we in sync on this , vincent ?
i drink what every civilized man , woman and child in the world drinks : guinness .
oh yeah ? whatta you drink , then ?
budweiser ? you talk to me of beer and you 've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence ? that 's not beer ! christ , it 's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss .
best beer in the world ? budweiser for me , thanks .
best beer in the world known to man or god .
what is ?
some places , not all . italy , for instance , they 're serious about their food . but try bloody britain , anywhere in the u.k. , you do n't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg . food 's not our thing , you see .
this ... this is incredible . is the rest of europe like this ?
that 's why you were riding with him .
i never did trust that blonde fuck ...
how do we know that ?
and you believed me ? but it was n't my people who did it .
and then ...
then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous .
which leads us to ...
you call me with the target 's route , i follow along until we 've reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road .
the deal ? the deal is we leave for nice at first light .
so what 's the deal ?
and who are you ?
i drive -- and my name is larry . larry from the states .
the name is deirdre , and i 'm running this show .
who the fuck are you ?
it 's good to see you 've all got such faith in our little undertaking .
no , seamus . i heard you the first time .
do i need to repeat myself ?
shut up ! ! ! shut up and drive ! i 'm your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say , is that understood ? ! ?
you 're thinking with your gun , seamus , and not your head ...
plastic fucking surgeon ? you think i 'm going to fix this , deirdre lass ? it 's the mark of the patriot , and i 'll wear it like a badge . as for those who done it to me , i 'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over .
you better be careful , seamus , before something happens a plastic surgeon ca n't fix .
they 're good !
good christ ! ca n't you lose these jokers ?
not yet ...
about time !
you lose them !
lose them !
that 's him .
from interpol ?
they 're part of the team . one of them 's the guy i told you about .
what in bloody hell is going on ?
nothing .
would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there ?
problem my ass ! i think you 're lying to me , and if you are you 're a dead man !
i thought i did .
not to me , you know that .
it 's been known to happen .
so you thought that maybe i 'd grown too attached to this charade i 've been playing , is that it ?
it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you . you 've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun , i might note . there 's no glory to it , but there are those that like it .
and what 's that supposed to mean , seamus reilly ?
now there 's the deirdre i know .
when we 're done with this , i want to do for that one myself .
come off it , sam -- if we were n't friends already we would n't be here now , would we ?
not me . you work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement .
alright ? it 's bloody fucking freezing in here !
are you alright ?
bloody fucking hell ...
i did n't say i was .
where do you get off saying word one ? all the time pretending to be one of us , it 's the same thing we were doing , seamus and myself . and here you are so high and mighty , like you 're so different from the rest of us .
do n't even think that i 'm buying that .
i 'm a patriate .
oh please..you 're on some sort of holy mission ?
well , if it is n't mr. interpol himself . i ca n't believe i misjudged you like i did .
that we 're too stupid to trace his calls .
check this out . gregor 's a spook , or he was one until recently . when he was a spy he lived the life -- you know , a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything . then the wall goes down . no more cold war . and gregor is out of a job . no apartment , no special stores with western food and video tapes . i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he does n't want to give it up . and i would n't be surprised if he 's arrogant enough to think ...
i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using , it was in his contract . cost a nice penny , too , especially that goddamned phone : gregor had expensive tastes .
exactly . gregor , he was the russian 's man . it was my people came up with the idea for this run , but the russians who had the capital to finance it . gregor , he was their insurance , and i was ours . everybody else was supposed to be neutral . gregor must 've got to swede ...
because if they had she 'd be gone along with the package , instead of sitting here with us .
i do n't know ... well i do n't ! it 's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you . but i do know who we 're working for . my people , and the russian mob .
now , what did we steal ?
just business .
duty calls ?
i better be getting that .
exactly . and last night i wanted to be with someone who was just like me .
you 're a hired gun , deirdre -- just like me .
i know i do n't have to , sam , it 's just that , for once , i want to . when i was a - patriot , it was a given i 'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with . you know : any man who needed setting up . sometimes so we might blackmail him , sometimes so he could be killed . sometimes so i could kill him myself . ira is n't exactly an enlightened feminist organization , sam . to most of the men i with i was always the girl . `` send the girl to do it . '' `` tell the girl to take care of it . '' `` have the girl fuck him . '' but i look at you and i get this feeling you take me for what i am : no more , no less .
you do n't have to explain yourself to me , deirdre .
look , sam , do n't take it the wrong way when i tell you we wo n't be doing this again .
i probably do . but for the time being , i 'm willing to forget about it ...
and when i consider that , i have to wonder if you do n't have some ulterior motive for being here , with me , right now .
nobody 's saying they do n't .
part of me says i should just look at this as a perk . you know , a bonus . but then i remember you 're you -- deirdre who used to belong to the ira -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you .
that 's right .
is that right ?
i still am .
i did n't think to see you again tonight . you were pretty pissed .
i feel as if i 've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon . could you teach me to do that ?
we were n't real thrilled about it either ...
the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information , and instead you went to fucking war ...
hazard pay ...
once .
you were a soldier , were you ?
sam . i 'm a weapons guy .
he 'll kill me anway , sam , shoot though me and kill this fucker .
shut up !
do n't do it , sam !
go ahead , shoot ... shoot and kill the bitch , i do n't care . and yet you do n't shoot . interesting . put down your weapon and walk away .
should any of you decide to rush me , i 'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time .
that fucking figures ...
there 's a problem ...
where 's the case ?
ready when you are ...
alright , gregor , i 'm ...
next .
i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target . i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice , relaying that information to you .
now then , let 's run through it one more time , shall we ? what 's your job ?
in this business , your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same .
but would you stake your life , that 's the question ...
i 'd stake my reputation .
you sure about this ?
i intend to . this phone is wired like no other : it 's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition , it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand . with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target 's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes ...
good , because it cost enough . there 's cheaper phones by far than that one , man : you better fucking use it .
it 's quite satifactory .
these days they they call me gregor -- and i 'm a tech . i do electronic work , surveillance , computer runs .
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it : no credit cards , no bank accounts are in place : ten percent up front , the rest when the job is done . you . what do you do and what should we call you ?
not likely . once , yeah , i was -- but there was n't an inch of profit in it , and i 'm a cash oriented girl , if you take my meaning . i 'm a hired gun , same as the rest of you , and that 's all any of us needs to know about the other .
who are you ? ira ?
i think not . after you ...
perhaps we could both go at the same time ...
you first , edvard .
do you have the material ?
really ? do you have the money with you ?
we 'll double your price .
i 'm sure . but i 'm sorry to say that it 's too late for trust : we have a serious problem .
that was a mistake , trying to kill you . mikhi did it without consulting me , i 'd have never allowed it .
i 'm touched , really , that they 'd send someone of your caliber . it 's nice to know that they did n't make the mistake of underestimating me twice .
yes , gregor , they sent me .
then you better find it in your heart to tell me , francois , because while your death is inevitable , it still is n't decided how painful it 's going to be .
in here ...
where 's my information ?
of course .
i take it you still want the money ...
if you say a word in english , vincent , my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat . sorry to screw you over like this , but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you , and that 's a price i 'm not willing to pay .
what 's that ?
there 's been a slight problem .
here 's yours .
he 's a cop , vincent , he 's french and he 's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now !
what do you mean ?
bad company ...
he 's company .
not so fast . who 's that ?
do you have it ?
you 'll die if you leave here .
we 'll die if we stay here !
i 'll destroy whatever 's in the case .
and more importantly --
enough !
i 'm shocked , shocked to think that you 'd believe him .
edvard said the same thing about you before he died .
whatever you wish ... this has all been a terrible mistake , gregor . i wanted to play straight with you , but edvard insisted we try and kill you .
no , mikhi , i would n't . since i wo n't speak your language , and you ca n't speak mine , english will do nicely .
sit , sit ... would you like one ?
i think not . i have , of course , taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens . unless , of course , i deactivate it before it goes off .
figured enough to know there 's an odd man out and i 'm looking at him .
so , you 've got it all figured , do you ?
what 's a little hate between business partners ?
but you hate each other !
what am i doing here ? why , i 'm here to see my partners , gregor , the boys in the russian mafia . see , your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross . but they only just found out that what 's in the briefcase is completely useless without me . i ca n't fight them , and they ca n't kill me -- that means we 're gon na have to do business together .
you 've told me a lot of things , boyo ...
it is , i 'm telling you it is ! !
this better be the real thing or you 're a dead man !
i swear , it has to come here ! it has to ...
if you 're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being , i 'm gon na blow your brains all over this car .
a post office box .
sent it where ?
i sent it to myself in paris .
then where is it ?
i swear ...
bullshit !
i do n't have it with me ...
do n't talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear , understand ? ! ? you have no choice in this , do n't think about winning , think about staying alive . i want the item , and if you do n't give it to me , i 'm gon na kill you .
now that is an interesting proposition .
so none of us knows who 's paying the freight , this is just some anonymous job . for all we know , we 're working for different people .
i got this gig through a contractor . and he most definitely did n't know who was doing the hiring , only that they were paying a lot of money ...
whoever hired us .
what i do is none of your concern . what you should do is wait for my next phone call . i 'm going to find a place where i can tilt the field in my favor . when i 'm ready , i 'll call you and tell you what i want you to do .
so what do we do ?
i 'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me !
it was a mistake , it should n't have happened .
much to your disappointment , no doubt .
gregor , is that you ?
it 's done .
is it done ?
i do , i do ...
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with .
i need you , swede , i ca n't do this without you !
really ?
nobody 's going to do that !
do n't cross me ...
what are you doing ?
what 's that ?
there is one other thing ...
then i guess we 're set .
that 's it .
a means to an end , is that it ?
i had n't thought about it . understand me , gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing . it does n't bother me one bit , but i do n't get off on it .
i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american .
because if there 's more than one party involved , if we really are working for different people , then perhaps some of us are on different sides . your orders might be different from mine .
how so ?
if he had n't you 'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago .
how did you know ?
not exactly ? but close enough , eh ? so he saved your life , then ?
not exactly .
i 've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through . he 's a cop ?
of course . do n't you ?
and you respect him .
yes , sam 's tough alright .
he 's tough , your american friend .
hello , my friend . he does n't look french to me , vincent .
hello , jean-pierre .
a samurai has honor , a samurai live by the code of bushido , the way of the warrior . i 'm just a killer for hire . the world is n't about honor , anymore . it 's about survival .
you seem one to me .
vincent 's life is his own burden ; he 'll have to carry it for himself . and i 'm not any kind of samurai .
perhaps forged is a better word . like steel . like a sword . you 're a modern samurai . i 've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like vincent . but i 've never seen anyone like you . i 'm afraid vincent will die if he goes with you .
created ?
i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created .
so what is it you want to know ?
perhaps . but you are not healthy , and if you try i 'll kill you .
if i was healthy , i could take that away from you .
call it a reckoning of character .
so this is what , a test ?
not a word . but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do . and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me . you work for some government agency and you carry a gun , and in my world , that makes you a cop .
vincent told you that i 'm a cop ?
you suffered through an agonizing pain last night , pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law .
i did n't expect that he would .
he sees this differently , as you well know .
forgive my intrusion into your affairs , but i am the one who connected vincent to this job , his agent , if you will . he is one of my oldest friends and i owe him a great debt , much like the debt i suspect he owes you .
it gets done now or not at all . another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i ca n't get them .
something important ? a thing that can not wait ?
yeah .
but first you have something to take care of ?
soon .
you should really let a doctor look at that .
some , thanks . enough to move on , for now .
then if you do n't mind ... i 'm gon na pass out .
do n't worry , we 'll take care of it .
you think you can stitch me up on you own ?
no booze ... pain 's in the mind , and the mind i can control . alright , let 's do it .
are you sure you wo n't have a drink ?
well , vincent 's american friend , shall we see what we can do for you ?
american .
did he bring that with him ?
what are you gon na do , call him up and ask him to give us back our shit ?
fine with fucking me , we got work to do . i do n't care what it takes , we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gon na pay us a great deal of money when we do . i do n't know about the rest of you guys , but i 'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass . i do n't mean that in , like , a literal way ...
it 's a cocktail . mostly demerol , cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future .
my way is better .
yeah , well ... my way works too .
why do n't you go do better , then ...
it 's been known to happen .
is that right ?
long enough to shoot back .
not for long .
all in the stomach , though . your man might live .
gets the job done .
you shoot alright .
anybody tries to unpleasant me i 'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes .
the point remains : we could be working for different people . there 's a chance for one of us ... maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others . i do n't know about you guys , but i like to know who i 'm working for . it can help prevent a great deal of ... ... unpleasantness .
i do n't think so .
i do n't particularly like killing , tubby , but i want you to know that this one i 'm going to enjoy .
not in mine .
it 's consider a virtue in some corners of the world .
is that right ?
you should learn a little patience .
where is this broad ?
i blast the lead car into oblivion ...
after we stop the target car i get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard .
eat shit and die slowly ...
i ride with fat-boy ...
who you calling dumb , dickless ?
and you could stand to get a little smarter , ai n't that right you dumb blonde fuck ?
i 'm just worried about your health , larry . you could stand to shed a few pounds .
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar ?
you should watch what you eat .
everybody .
who 's they ?
they call me swede .
i got a surprise for you , blondie ...
what a surprise ...
what 're you talking about , man ? i do n't understand .
just to keep me company , sam -- i hate smoking alone . how about you ? i thought all you ira types smoked .
i told you , i quit .
i guess that 's for the best .
gone . destroyed .
what happened to it ?
i do n't know . nobody knows , except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us . there 's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know , but i do n't think they plan to tell me anytime soon .
tell me something first . the package : what was it ?
you better get some sleep , alright ?
i know .
you do n't owe me a goddamned thing , vincent , and you know it . you stepped in front of a bullet for me . i owe you a heavy debt .
`` your field dressing saved his life . '' that 's three i owe you .
nothing ...
what of it ?
you speak french .
what ?
you son-of-a-bitch ...
finish it !
and now ...
finish the job ...
let 's get him out of here ...
i 'll work on it ...
you have to stop doing that !
no , i do n't .
do you have a good answer ?
that 's a good question .
and when you finish ? what then ? this package , whatever it is , do you give it to the cia ? do you really think they deserve it ?
and yet you would have killed him to save my life . you have a sense of honor , vincent , that i ca n't even remember anymore . i do n't know that i ever even had it to begin with . all i know to do , vincent , is to finish my job .
closest and oldest .
it 's the one thing i 've got left to hold onto . jean-pierre is one of your closest friends , is he not ?
why not ?
because i do n't walk away .
why then , sam , do n't you act like this is a job like any other ? surely , if you are a hired gun , you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for .
the mark of a true samurai . what i do for the company , vincent , is no different than what you do . we 're both hired guns , and this is a job -- like any other job .
why ? you 've got more force of will than anyone i 've ever seen . you handle a gun like it 's a part of you , you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia ... and most amazing of all , you quit smoking , just like that .
would you stop with that ...
what of it ? samurai pain in the ass .
not just like that ... just before i turn around and it 's six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette .
just like that ?
time to quit .
if i 'm going to die for the cia , i 'm going to go out smoking . besides , there 's half a forest between us and them , they ca n't see a goddamned thing .
not here . they might see it .
yeah . we need out fucking heads examined .
do we need anything else ?
i think not .
in a minute .
if our positions were reversed , would you leave me ?
no you do n't , and you know it .
so i do it .
i know i do n't need to say this to you , but i need to say it to you . this is my job , i have to do it .
something like that .
business keeps you on the road ?
i 'm not here very much .
why are you driving ? you 're not french , you do n't live here , you do n't know these roads . why are you driving ?
gim me a goddamn cigarette ! ! ! !
right now ?
give me a cigarette .
you do n't know ? bullshit , you had her , there was no way out .
i do n't know ...
what the fuck happened ?
you said it yourself : gregor 's not dead . if they had the package , they 'd have killed him .
you think ?
they do n't have the package .
because i owe you . look at that ...
how could you have done that ?
i would have tried not to . but yes , if it would have kept him from shooting you , i would have .
you would have done that ?
i was waiting to see what would happen . i did n't want to kill him if i did n't have to .
you were behind the door ?
i know . jean-pierre did .
i never made that claim .
not very zen of you , huh ? not so much the modern samurai after all .
it is at that .
very ugly .
dark operations . wet work . kidnaping . assassination .
dark ops ?
i 'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed . i do dark ops .
it 's a cover , then . a cover within a cover , a feint within a feint . you work for the cia , it 's the only possible answer .
sure i do . you heard him , you heard the guy -- that 's what he said , what edvard said .
then quit . you do n't work for interpol , sam .
it 's my job .
continue when it would be so much easier to give it up .
do what ?
tell me , sam : why do you do this ?
if tony says this is it , then it 's it .
you sure your friend got the right place ?
thorough man .
the address of the russian production company . just in case we need to find them .
what 's this ?
yes .
the irish representative ?
i know of him .
you know him ?
good . now take the forceps , and remember , vincent , what we 're doing here is routine . i 've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field . there are no vital organs where you 're working , no major muscles or arteries -- you ca n't kill me . just make sure you 've got the bullet before you try to pull it out .
clearly .
you see the bullet ?
alright , it 's done .
yes i do .
you do n't have to do this .
it is n't about money for me , not anymore .
this does n't involve you , do n't you understand ? i ca n't even guarantee you any money out of all this .
i 'm going with you .
we ? there is no we in my world now , vincent , just me .
it looks to me like we 're all that 's left of our group .
my job , vincent , a job you do n't need to know about . i ca n't go to the local cops -- they 'd never be able to get close enough at this point . it 's me or nobody , and i 've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish .
and what job is that ?
if i was a cop , a real cop , i 'd have busted you a long time ago . this is n't about you , it 's about the job i have to do .
you 're with interpol -- you 're a cop .
not exactly .
fix it yourself ? why are we even doing this ? there 's no need to run , christ ... you 're a cop .
no hospitals . i 'll fix this myself if i have to .
no ... i thought i 'd take you to the hospital .
you know one around here ? somebody you trust ?
you see it your way , i 'll see it mine . you need a doctor .
i did n't save your life back there . risked it , maybe -- but i did n't save shit .
that makes twice now you 've saved my life .
but you ca n't .
you 're a cop ... you 're a fucking cop ... i should kill you .
it 's paris . the route 's too indirect for anything else . a guy like gregor , he does n't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place . otherwise , he 'd be out of the country by now . he 's going to paris . now i just hope we can find him before he gets there .
not necessarily . he could go off road at any number of places . he might not even be in the country anymore .
he 's going back .
you might be a hired gun , vincent , but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits .
i never really thought i was part of the world you move in , sam , to tell you the truth . i 'm a hood , a thief . big time in a small time king of way . to the local police i 'm a prize , to the local hoods i 'm a legend . but to a guy like you i 'm just another two bit hired gun .
we live in a singular world , my friend .
i wo n't lie -- there have been times when i had to do it , times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man did n't .
you do n't . you just learn to live with it .
i have n't . not like that . how do you get used to it ?
i 've seen a lot of people die before .
a lot of people died .
it was at that .
i have a feeling i 'm about to start buying my own .
of course ... whenever you feel like it just help yourself .
i borrowed that , too ...
please , help yourself . smoke as many you 'd like .
i hope you do n't mind i took your pack . it was on the table .
you were smoking ?
i came up here to sneak a smoke .
you were n't around when i woke up , i thought maybe something had happened . this has been one very fucked up job , sam , and i 'm not taking any more chances on anybody ... including you ...
what 's going on ?
gregor 's cell phone ...
the question still remains : what do we do now ?
because that 's what i would have done ...
but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did ?
i saw you look off when francois nodded his head . i figured he was n't pointing out a particularly rare shrub , and the rest was easy .
that there was a gun pointed at me .
know what ?
how did you know ?
well i ai n't a cop .
i needed to see if you were a cop . i 'm a popular man with the police , sam , and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together . and that 's the guy you have to watch out for . i hate cops ...
you know , what you pulled back there , that was bullshit .
you need to know a lot of shit , vincent .
i needed to know .
see what ?
i just wanted to see something .
what 's going on ?
they 'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york , and it would still get fucked up .
lovely , is n't it ?
whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless .
they certainly are . whatever it is we 're going to steal , it must be quite something .
that 's right : there 's not hardly enough work these days , nothing that pays the big money , anyhow . then along comes this job , paying so much goddamned money i could n't afford not to take it . somebody 's paying through the nose for this .
you were once some kind of special forces . airborne ranger , maybe a navy seal . after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan , a real mercenary . only now -- now you 're like the rest of us , it 's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war . there 's a lot of hired guns out here , and not nearly enough work to go around .
who am i ?
i wanted to see who you were .
i 've wondered that myself . none of this answers my question , though ... why bring me ?
i wonder if she truly left the ira .
deirdre ? smart , yeah , and seriously goddamned dangerous .
so is the woman .
watch that one , he 's an ex-spook for sure , maybe stasi , maybe kgb . he 's smart , gregor is .
let 's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited . of course , i might have brought gregor , but he did n't seem like the right candidate -- for this .
exactly . why not bring them ?
like larry or swede .
so , vincent : why bring me along for the ride ? job like this calls for a warm body , somebody who can stand around and look threatening . a tough guy .
there is that .
it has it 's moments . course , you get cancer and die , that 's the down side .
christ , i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day , and i tell myself i could be worse . it 's just so damned pleasurable .
i do .
a cigarette ? as in one ? one cigarette a week , who smokes like that ?
i have , i do n't know , maybe a cigarette a week .
help yourself . since when do you smoke ?
one 's a lot more painful than the other .
what 's the difference ?
not at all . similar , but not the same .
same thing , is n't it ?
jujitsu .
that was a nice move you did on our young friend . judo ?
i asked if we could give him anything else .
what 'd you say to him ?
i do n't . but the language he 's speaking is universal .
i did n't know that you spoke french .
and i suppose he 's saying that we oughta give them something for using it , huh ?
something like that ...
as in , they own it ?
he says this is their block .
that 's what i thought .
pretty much what you 'd expect .
i can do that .
to see a man about a thing .
where to ?
things . this is my country , you know .
coordinate what ?
i 'm vincent . and i coordinate .
let 's just say he knows who i am .
he trusts you to lock up ?
no thanks .
cigarette ?
i know cops -- and you 're no cop .
perhaps the police ?
who else would you be ?
what makes you think we 're here to meet you ?
sorry i 'm late ...
seamus reilly .
last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address , name of seamus reilly .
gon na be tough .
it 's the irish tape we want .
cause the russian production company would be easier to find .
why 's that ?
i 'm sure .
you sure ?
gaelic .
it 's an international thing . several different peoples involved , criminals from all over the world , experts brought together to do a job . but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together . an unlikely group of partners .
what 's the story ?
you slept with the fucker ! !
you put everything on the line because you ...
you should have kill him when you had the chance . but no ...
you slept with her !
how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us ?
you slept with her !
why did n't you kill him ?
why did n't you kill her ?
it 's a matter of respect . why do n't you wait outside , this wo n't take long .
i got ta try and overcharge him , he has to moan about the price , we settle somewhere in the middle .
tony and i have to talk some business , first .
i get the picture .
seamus reilly , boy 's a serious irish auteur -- a real firebrand . thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies , if you see what i 'm saying .
the russian would be easier .
can you get it ?
all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version .
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape ?
what i 've heard so far , it 's all a lot of talk . i was n't so sure what to make of it at first , cause , like i said , the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix .
i might know where you could get a copy .
do you have the tape ?
matter of face there 's this flick i 've been hearing about . i have n't seen it , but from what i hear it 's pretty cool .
i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new .
why do n't we step into my office ...
a friend . i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes .
doing well . this is ?
i 'm alright . and you ?
my man , how you doing ?
do n't lie to me ! ! ! !
i do n't know what you 're -
shut up ! not another word out of you ! you 're going down , the feds know all about it ! you did n't know some of it was marked , did you ! where 's the rest ?
dwayne listen to me -
i should kill you right here ! i never thought you 'd do this to me but i guess there 's a lot i did n't know about you !
i ca n't get enough of it .
whatsamatter with you ? are n't you concerned about all of this ?
i want to get some hounds down here .
damn .
none of them had any --
i 'd like to know what they were doing in my town ! did you get id off any of them ?
looks like some kind of drug deal or something , they 're not from around here -- one of them 's still alive .
what the hell happened here ?
hey dwayne why do n't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin ?
sort of !
rock solid .
and you 're solid on that ?
uh huh .
that 'll bring me down , too . eventually . you got ta know that .
i ca n't . i ca n't go on . i ca n't keep lying ... killing . that 's not me . that 's not us .
just one more . this one knocks off all the rest .
it 's not about the money anymore . ca n't you see that ? it 's about
you 're the one who 's nuts ! there 's no one left to touch us , booth . we 're home free ! we just plant a little of the money on dwayne , and it 's all ours .
yes it is . i 'm calling it in . right now .
it 's not too late !
it 's too late ...
dwayne had the opportunity , just like us . he was at the scene . he grabbed the cash . of course . this is perfect !
what are you talking about ?
i know , i know . dwayne 's dead , but we can deal with it . we 'll pin it on him . the dea was driving jesse 's car . no car phone . no radio . they could n't have called me in .
dwayne 's dead .
what do you mean ? look . we can make still make it work .
no . it stops now . it stops here .
we got to get out of here . do you understand ? we got to get out of here right now !
he killed her ...
booth , listen to me ... booth !
he found us , he shot her ... he killed her ...
what happened ? what 's earl doing here ?
he killed her ... he killed her ...
oh jesus ...
then sally comes too .
that 's right .
we 've got to go now , then .
we 'll take the money and disappear ! we can do it , spend it on the move . even if all of it 's marked , there 's ways around it .
we 're not ? how do you figure that ?
no we 're not .
then we 're screwed .
i do n't know . they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays .
it was all used . random numbers . how can they trace it ?
i do n't know for sure , but why else would they head for the bank ?
i sure as hell hope so . let 's go .
do you have everything ?
come on . booth grabs the bag --
maybe we should say somethin ' .
yes i do ! it never woulda stopped , you know that . jesse 's always gon na be making mistakes and we 'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives .
you do n't know if he was really gon na --
we 're doing what we got ta do , to protect ourselves !
jesus christ earl ... what are we doing ? ...
like hell it is . this is jesse ! jesse !
it 's gon na be o.k .
you killed him ...
even if we have the tape , that would n't shut him up !
there it is ... now what about the others ?
here it is .
i 'm just making our intentions clear . go check the desk .
what are you thinking ? we were only supposed to scare him !
i do n't know ! shit , give me a break !
how long is it going to take ? !
who said anything about killing ? just keep driving straight ...
not bad enough to kill him .
how badly do you want that money ? ! how bad do you want to stay out of jail ?
you 're crazy .
i do n't know ... we have to shut him up somehow . booth looks at earl --
well what are we supposed to do ?
i do n't think he 's going to be doing any bargaining with us , the stupid son-of-a-bitch ! besides , i 'm not giving him a third of anything , not after everything we had to do .
maybe we can reason with jesse , give him a third in exchange for the tape .
if you 're any friend at all , you 'll stop talking like that !
look , earl . we got ta go straight . this is all messed up ...
neither do i .
no .
you think he 's bluffing ?
yeah , i mean you 're coming unglued , jesse .
you 're out of your mind .
well i mean it this time . come on . let 's get this over with !
you said that last time !
for christ 's sake , booth , i just needed to take care of a few debts is all ! you got my word on it -- i 'm not going near it again until everything cools down .
we had a deal ! what was i , talking to the wall ?
he 's a partner now , earl , like it or not .
he 's going to be trouble .
forget the copies ! he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original .
he 's probably made copies . he 's not going to give them up to us .
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape . we 'll set him up somehow .
and how do you figure we do that ?
i 've got a better idea . all we have to do is straighten out jesse .
... or get rid of the money . i do n't know .
well does n't he ? besides if the dea heard that tape we 'd be behind bars right now . just call it the cost of doing business . this whole thing is screwed up . i 'm thinking . maybe we should tell 'em the truth ...
well i 'm not ! thinks he 's got us by the balls .
all right enough ! i 'm tired of thinking about all this !
i could kill that no good son of a bitch !
exactly . this is our little secret , partner .
he would have done it to us , right ?
listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
that 's not what i mean .
okay then . i 'll do it .
i ca n't do that .
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's just a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one .
i do n't know ...
what are you thinking ?
shit ! we 're gon na have to get rid of him . i 'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life . we ca n't risk it .
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !
man take it easy ! you 're sweating like crazy !
i should have known something like this was going to happen !
it 's the stupid thing to do , that 's what it is .
it 's the right thing to do .
are you nuts ? they 'll fry us for sure . there 's no way we 're doin ' that , you understand ? no way .
we got ta turn ourselves in , before they hear the tape .
oh , right , with a little help from his pals booth and earl . i 'm sure that 's gon na fly real far when they hear that tape ...
no we did n't . he died on his own .
we assaulted a federal agent . we killed him .
well , we did n't know that at the time .
that guy was a federal agent . an officer of the law , just like us .
i do n't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there ? ! we 're going to play it cool ... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway ...
this is n't a joke . what are we going to do !
i do n't know ...
we 're dead . we 're dead , we are dead ... what are we going to do ? !
forget it . we 're going to bury it , and we 're not going to even think about it until everything dies down . and no one , i mean no one hears a word about it . understand ?
fair enough , i 'll take it to my place .
look . dwayne was right . this is going to be a big story . so big in fact that i do n't want to even have this money around .
well we did n't kill him , he died on his own .
i do n't want to hear about miracles and god and all that ! we tried to murder someone to cover our asses !
i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
that 's not what i mean .
okay then . i 'll do it .
i ... i ca n't do that .
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one ...
i do n't know ...
what are you thinking ?
i 'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail . we ca n't risk it .
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !
he saw everything !
i do n't know ! son of a bitch ! who the hell are you ?
well , i do n't know . i 'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
what are you gon na do ?
shhh !
well , we wo n't do any of that shit !
we 're going to be patient . if we start flashing money around , buying fancy cars and fancy clothes , people are going to ask questions .
what 's that ?
i 've got one condition .
i do n't know .
we 'll leave a few packets in the trunk , and stash the rest somewhere else . car went up in the gunfight .
torch it ? !
we 'll torch the bases , how 's that ?
all right we will .
i do . it 's little shit like that sends people to jail ! we have to cover all the bases if we 're going to pull this !
maybe . who cares ?
all right hold on ! lem me think ... shit , did you touch the car ?
they killed themselves . besides , they were breaking the law . what they were doing was wrong ! whatsamatter booth , do n't you believe in miracles ?
at the expense of six people .
that 's right !
oh so god 's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks ?
it 's no accident we stumbled on this money . it 's an answer to a prayer ! every night and every day i 've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little , give me a little push . tonight my prayer came true .
because ... i know .
what makes you so sure ?
i 'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens , and it 's not gon na happen !
it 's going to go bigger than that . could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it ?
who 's going to question us ? dwayne ? jesse ?
suppose someone knows about the money ? they 're bound to ask questions .
we would never have to worry about money -- ever again , jesus !
we 'll figure something out .
i told trudy we were coming down this way , that 's why !
why ?
it wo n't work .
hell , it wo n't be us !
well someone 's gon na find them .
come on booth ! look at these scumbags around us . who 's going to know what happened ! let 's take it and get out of here !
we do n't know that .
robbed a bank , c'mon ! do n't you think we would have heard if one , two -- shit i do n't know how many were at large ! do n't you think there would be a bulletin ? this is a big ass drug deal !
we do n't know whose money it is ! they might have robbed a bank , who knows ?
look around you partner ! you said yourself you never saw anything like it .
no . we ca n't .
why ? are you kidding me ?
call it in i guess . why ?
i mean -- earl grabs booth 's arm --
what do you mean what are we going to do ?
what are we going to do ?
shit , more than that .
there must be over a million dollars in here .
ten thousand right here .
they 're out of towners ... arizona plates ...
what the hell ...
that 's what everyone thinks . but according to him , when it 's the real thing , it 's quite an intimidatin ' environment in which to concentrate .
i probably would have . i guess the clues damn near before everyone .
oh , you would have done great .
never heard of it .
cash and carry , you know , fdr , world war two ...
cash and what ?
he would have won more but he blew it at the end . did n't know what cash and carry was .
seven thousand ...
yeah ... i remember my brother-in-law gary , the wheel watcher . he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars ! plus some leather furniture . do you think i saw any of that ? his excuse was the government got it all .
i hear you .
i would have asked my sister , but its better to leave family out , always leads to trouble .
well i hope so . that pretty much cleaned me out .
thanks for the loan , man . i 'll have it in a few days , i promise .
the horniest dog in nevada .
how old is otis anyhow , thirty ?
i knew you 'd come through . jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave .
do n't spend it all in one place .
sure thing , and --
ready to roll , partner ?
what are you doing , earl ?
okay ! it 's under my desk ! ! taped to the bottom side ! ! !
whoa , earl !
helllllp ! ! ! !
shut up , jesse .
you 're only screwing yourselves over ! helllllp ! helllllp ! somebody ! ! !
do n't have much choice , jesse . you saw to that !
come on , booth . do n't let him do this ! ! !
you better believe it if you know what 's good for you !
you do n't expect us to believe that do you ?
no . it 's not .
i was beginning to think you were n't going to show . that ca n't be all of it .
i 'm not gon na take -- i 'm not gon na take it in stride . i had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out .
just take it in stride .
well i do n't know what 's going to happen next -- she 's pressing this , another interrogation , another problem .
none of us like it !
i do n't like getting grilled by that dea bitch , i do n't like taking that kind of heat !
i want my share . all of it .
what are you proposing ?
there 's going to have to be a change in our arrangement .
by friday .
two thousand ...
i understand your logic , booth , but i do n't think ... two thousand 's going to raise any eyebrows , do you ?
how much ?
ok ... i 'll wait . for now . but i 'm going to need a little advance , to oil the wheels , so to speak .
that 's the deal . if you do n't like it , forget it , no one wins .
well , i do n't know ...
we 're going to wait . all of us , until everything dies down .
i 'm all ears .
all right , jesse , we 'll play it your way , under one condition .
besides , i 'm not stupid , earl . the tape was a basic maxell d-80 . you can buy 'em at any store . there 's no way they can pin anything on me .
my offer ? well i 'd say it 's a fair one , like i said we 're friends . all i want is my share , which i guess is ...
what 's your offer , jesse ?
listen earl . i covered for you . for both of you . i put my ass on the line to save yours , so do n't pull a hostile tone with me !
my point , well ...
why do n't you get to the point .
you gentlemen look like you 're about to toss your collective cookies .
it 's odd . i do n't know how denning had the time , or the ability to buy something local , based on his situation .
yeah ? so ?
denning was wearing a bug .
what 's that ?
well , we have one lead and that 's what i 'm looking into next .
yes . wife and a kid . do n't blame yourself , deputy . you did all you could . you have our deepest gratitude ... and my personal thanks .
you mean that guy was an agent ?
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap , but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys . the last we heard from him was two days ago .
maybe . that 's where it was during denning 's last report .
could it have been in the mercedes ?
because someone may have gotten away .
no . why ?
thank you . now , do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site , on your way to or from ?
hello .
how are ya ?
you know i do .
sally , do you love me ?
i swear to you , it 's true ...
i do n't believe it .
things just got a little screwed up , that 's all .
yeah . i want to tell you everything .
do you wan na tell me what that was all about ?
yeah , it is ...
yeah , i guess you 're right . it 's just ... all so sudden ...
we 'll meet new people . you might have friends out there you never met .
i do n't know . my friends ...
sally there 's a whole world out there . we can have a new home . a real home , not some tin-plated dump . what are you giving up ?
i 'm not sure why . it 's just , i 've never been anywhere else ...
why does that bother you ?
it 'll be more than enough . we can get out of here ...
can you rely on how much they said you 'd get ?
should n't be long . a couple of weeks maybe .
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out ?
i 'll be there for you . he wo n't try anything while i 'm there . i promise . i 'll protect you .
i do n't know , booth .
i 'm going to quit . that 's what has to happen first . then we 're going to tell him .
how are we going to do all this ?
well i was just throwing out ideas ...
a satellite dish ?
i love you .
i love you sally .
so do i .
it 'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us .
we 'd ... i do n't know ... go to california , new york , maybe a house on a swiss mountainside ...
i hate it when you talk like this . go on .
let 's just get out of here , get out of this -- place . we 'll drop out , get a house have some kids , get a satellite dish ...
i used to think he was something , once ... i was eighteen , i did n't know any better , and he had something steady to offer .
it does n't matter ... he 's next to you . you know , i always say to myself , you should have left him years ago . why did n't you ?
he does n't slobber , he just snores . and i told you we have n't ... done anything in over a year .
every night i think about you sleeping with him , him slobbering all over you .
i know .
dammit , i 'm so sick of this .
let 's hope so . sally if he asks me again , i 'm gon na tell him i returned it all .
it 's ok , booth , it 's no big deal .
great ...
he started digging through my closet , something he never does .
how the hell did he find it ?
i told him i bought the lingerie , as a surprise . i do n't think he suspects anything , but now you know , if he mentions it .
well , i ca n't let you down now , can i ?
you 're worth every last penny .
there is n't gon na be a next time . we 're gon na get out of here .
and i 'd end up a widow in two ways . let 's forget it . i 'll just be a little more careful next time .
and i 'd take it out on him .
let 's not get into this again . i know him . if you said something , he 'd take it out on me .
booth . do n't . it 's nothing . it 's not worth it . remember what happened the last time ?
that son of a bitch .
he 's not , he 's ...
like hell it 's over . you told me he was n't doing this anymore .
dwayne got a little tipsy is all . he does n't handle pressure well . it 's over .
nothing happened ?
what happened to your cheek ? sally oh i ... nothing ...
you deserve it is the occasion .
you got me something ? what 's the occasion ?
i 'm in here .
sally ? i was beginning to think he was n't gon na leave .
i love you too .
ok. i love you .
i 'm just tired is all . i 'll see you tonight ok baby ?
yeah i 'm fine .
are you sure you 're ok ?
ok .
oh . you coming by tonight ?
nothing 's wrong .
nothing .
what 's wrong ?
i know .
it was all over the local news . dwayne was there , acting all official .
yeah .
heard you had quite a night .
hi .
hi .
i might have to look into that ...
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours ...
no . but he would , probably .
has he ?
ah hell , he 'd do the same for me .
he 's irresponsible .
well , not that i would n't sugar bun but earl 's in a bind . they 're going to take his car .
yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three .
there 's an atm on speedwell avenue .
i got ta take some money out , that 's what for .
what for ?
i have to go to the bank before it closes .
thanks for your time .
a week ago , at most .
be more specific . a month , a week ...
could it have been this ?
i do n't remember . we get a lot of people in here .
what did he buy ?
yeah , i 've seen him .
first you question my integrity , then you call me stupid ... ... that hurts , son .
what is this ? do n't be stupid man ...
am i speaking english here ? how-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave ?
what ?
how about you give us what you have and leave .
and what 's that ?
i have a better plan .
what ?
i have a better plan . you want to hear it ?
you said that , i did n't .
you did n't answer my question . are you saying my word is of no value to you ?
business is business . now where the hell is it ? i wan na get out of here . that 's the plan , we 're just flunkies , you know what i 'm saying ?
sounds like you do n't trust me .
yeah .
test the product ?
hell , i do n't know . if i had some input i 'd offer it up .
what do you think about all this ?
this just might be our ticket !
i do n't know .
we had hounds down at the scene , the footprint trail was a bust . and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity .
what makes you say that ?
cause we got footprints leading into that brush , i want to see where it leads ... jesus , seven dead . i 'll tell you i 've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts . i do n't like it . not in my jurisdiction .
why ?
speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sally 's meatloaf again , and i do n't think i could stand that .
do n't worry the real men are in charge now .
all right , deputies , take care , do n't let your meat loaf .
did you say after midnight ?
ok ... this is good . our first solid lead .
fine . the information does n't leave this room .
dwayne ... it is imperative that we keep this confidential . now we know someone 's out there . very close . it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner .
dwayne .
sheriff hogan --
well yes i understand that , we do n't want them high-tailing it out of here .
well you can understand why we did n't say anything . if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us .
have you known this all along ?
we do n't know . whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system .
mm-hmm ...
hell no . besides i 'm just a radio call away if something happens . i feel i should keep abreast of what happens , seeing it 's my jurisdiction and all .
do n't you have to be here ?
maybe i should come along .
oh that was agent wallace . we 're going to check into something .
because they do n't want anyone to hear what 's on it , obviously .
why would someone do that ?
well , unfortunately denning 's not here to tell us , but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it .
what are you getting at ?
maybe . maybe not .
do n't you think i would have told you that !
uh , no ...
we appreciate that .
well we 'd like to help you in any way we can . we 're all in this together , as law enforcement officers .
damn ! martin i 'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that . i thought maybe it would help . booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin , clearly relieved --
well nothing audible to us . maybe the lab can pick something up .
excellent . i 'll go down with you .
yeah . i told him i 'd be there before five .
that 's news to me . so it 's over at jesse 's office ?
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who 's who , what was said , what 's happening . i contacted your local coroner , and he found it taped to his back .
i wanted to ask you some questions about last night .
i guess we can get started .
sure ... dissolve to ext hogan house -- night
yeah , racy stuff , you know the kind , right ?
lingerie ...
not exactly . it 's some lingerie store on the strip .
what the hell is that , some kind of porno store or something ?
yeah .
so there was money there ! who the hell 's money is it ? !
some of it . denning only handled a small portion of the total , but it looks like this was one of his bills .
is this marked money , or what ?
mr. curtis called us this afternoon . the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop . came through a store called after midnight . there 's only four employees , none of them can tell us who passed them .
oh yeah . between here and vegas we get a lot of customers . all types . even had an officer , just like you .
a lot of men come in here ?
oh , that 's ok , a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here .
i 'm just not very good ... with all of this stuff .
sure .
well ... i should have done a little homework , getting all the sizes , and what not .
no i do n't . you sure you havent seen her ?
do you know ... 34 c ? 32 c ?
yeah i 'd say c ... c .
c ?
uh ... c ?
let 's see ... do you know her cup size ?
oh .
no , i ca n't say that i have .
shopping here ?
have i seen her ?
i do n't suppose you 've seen her .
hmmm ...
yeah , she is . she comes up to about here on me .
we are having a sale on some items over here --
sixty five ... jeez louise !
well i do n't know ...
anything ... specific ?
i have an anniversary coming up , thought i 'd buy her something special .
well i just uh , you know ...
anything i can help you with ?
hi .
hello .
well , i just got a lot of things on my mind is all .
you walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich .
no . something wrong with you dwayne ?
something wrong , jesse ?
well i 'm here now .
nice of you to join us . i did say three o'clock , did n't i ?
yeah ... see you at three .
i have complete faith in you . but do n't you go speeding .
i 'll do my best ... that does n't give me much time .
so be here at three .
uh , sure . i hear you .
well they really did n't go into any details on the phone , but they did ask for you , and i figure we should try to help them out as best we can .
about what ?
well , we got the dea coming down here again , i do n't know , sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us .
why ?
vegas ! can you hightail it back here by three o'clock ?
i 'm at a payphone in vegas . what 's up ?
yeah whaddya want ? .
jesse ?
yeah . that 's all i need , to become one of your in-laws .
she 's not his type .
sort of .
do you even have a girlfriend , jesse ?
take it or leave it .
aw , now thats gon na take time to clear !
dammit youre persistent . i dont want to listen to this anymore . no more bets with you .
no . but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me , and im a busy man .
all right youre the super sleuth , what do you want , a medal ?
very clumsy , very clumsy . id have found it in a minute .
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow , no drugs in her system , no foul play .
damn its hot in here ...
i mean at least pick a more discreet place , the scalp , under the armpit , under the tongue , someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look .
just goes to show you .
calm down --
dwayne please calm down !
you 'd do this to me !
dwayne -
you 'd do this to me ? !
shut up ! ! ! slut ! ! !
dwayne put the gun down --
you shut your mouth you son of a bitch !
it certainly is ...
save me the sermon . i 've heard it all before , it 's boring .
no , dwayne , you go ahead and relax , have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv , and come upstairs and pass out . and do it all over again tomorrow !
look i worked all day , i 'm tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace ! is that asking too much ?
whatever ...
well i got the tires rotated , i went shopping , and i made dinner .
yeah let 's hear about your day .
do n't you want to hear about my day ?
just trying to be civil dwayne .
well you might as well say it . mister small time ...
i did n't say that . you did .
suppose i 'm not exciting enough for you .
that has n't stopped you before .
not much to tell . nothing really happened .
nothing . nothing 's the matter . sally are n't you going to tell how your day went ?
watch that . watch that tone .
i 'm saying you 're about as romantic as a bag of sand .
what are you saying ?
a surprise huh ? well i do n't like any surprises , especially if i 'm forking over the loot for them !
it was going to be a surprise !
forget it .
i ca n't hear a word you 're saying !
where 's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing ?
what ?
hey where 's the hot pad ?
i do n't know ...
what 's this ?
stop ! stop ! i do n't need the money . you can have it all .
easy to purchase , hard to detect . too much potassium can kill a man . just have to ... pick a discreet spot .
we got ta , jesse . it 's tough , but you did n't leave us any choice . we got ta know where the tapes are .
do n't hurt me .
well it 's not here -- you 're wasting your time and you 're pissing me off !
i do n't suppose you 'll tell us where the tape is .
we 're gon na talk .
what the hell are you doing , you crazy some bitches --
i think i am .
you 're never getting that much .
you want to see how more unglued i can get ? try me .
well you ca n't have it .
so i want the money and i want it now .
oh jesus christ ...
i was on a roll ! im a little overextended now .
what do you mean ? you gambled it ?
listen -
well you 're not getting , either .
i 'm not asking .
just do it ! meet me there , now .
what ?
meet me at the tumbleweed diner .
right behind you .
we 're out of here .
true , but neither is attempted murder . in fact i 'd say that 's considerably worse , would n't you , earl ?
and if we refuse ? your tampering with evidence is n't exactly a misdemeanor , did you ever consider that ?
i 'll settle for a third of that .
then what the hell are you all about ?
hey we 're all friends , right ? friends do n't squeal on friends , that 's not what jesse segundo is all about .
absolutely positively .
thank you honey . are you sure you do n't want it ?
you 've done without it long enough , ma .
well i do n't know --
ah , hell i 'll get one soon enough . besides , i want you to have it .
do n't you want it ?
yeah . figured you could have it .
this whole place ?
yep , fifteen thousand btu 's , enough to cool off this whole place .
that 's great earl !
and not just any air conditioner . this baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail .
well what do you know ! an air conditioner .
well basically i forgot about it , you know , you never win these things , but this time , well ...
and what happened ?
there was this raffle going on at the station , some charity or church was running it , i forget , so i figure what the hell put in my five bucks ...
you do ?
yeah sure i 'll grab something before i go ... hey -- i 've got a surprise .
are you hungry ?
at least around here it does .
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent .
nope . if you 're a criminal you do n't carry id , and if you do you 're a damn fool .
did they ever find out who they were ?
it was pretty gory ma , let me tell you . but you have to turn all that off , and do your job , just like pop used to say .
people have been asking me about that story in the paper . i told them you were the first person on the scene . they were asking me for all the details .
well , same ol ' same ol ' .
how 's work ?
yeah .
is that the mail ?
i was in the neighborhood .
i did n't know you were coming .
hi .
hi ma .
not getting an answer ? for christ 's sake ! call 911 ! let 's get it locked down here !
i 'm not getting an answer .
this is n't right ...
what do you think ? heart attack ?
yeah .
we 're going to find out .
you think he skipped town ?
i knew it , i knew it all along - shit !
he did n't make it into work , and he 's not home .
we 're doing a check on the manufacturers' serial number , see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch . what 's your take on these local boys ? are they providing any answers ?
no , it does n't . neither does his blank tape . any news on that ?
i do n't know how else you 'd explain it . the coroner 's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started , unless of course denning started it , and that does n't make much sense .
so someone did get away .
that fire was set . deliberately . and probably not by anyone found at the scene .
so ... what 's the good news ?
yeah , we did . it was unleaded , high octane .
that does n't tell us much . did you run a check on the gas like i told you ?
not in the trunk .
there was more than that .
but nowhere near three million dollars worth . i would say maybe twenty thousand .
money .
anything in it ?
we retrieved a few things from the trunk , including a steamer trunk , or the remnants of a trunk , the brass clips and so forth .
give me the bad news .
you want to hear the good news first , or the bad news ?
sir , i 'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time i get back they 're gon na make you governor . captain , you there ? hello ? shit !
no , carter . the reason i 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong . and what the hell is heaven on earth ?
is it because of the hookers , sir ? you tell them there 's no crime in being lonely .
i 've waited my whole life for this job , but i do n't have a shot in hell of getting it . do you know why ?
two hundred cops ? was mario sanchez there ? he owes me money .
do you know what happened yesterday , carter ? i was officially nominated for the commissioner 's post for the lapd . there was a dinner last night , two hundred lapd officers were there .
did i say dinner ? i meant diner . biscuits and gravy , you love that shit .
it 's nine-thirty in the morning .
hong kong ? i 'm not in hong kong . i 'm in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine , two minutes from the station . how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner ?
is it true , carter ? are you in hong kong right now ?
i 'm up a hundred and fifty-grand . that 's a ferrari . do they sell those here in the gift shop ? somebody cash me out !
winner ! four , winner !
two-hundred thousand dollars ? who wants a hundred dollars ?
two-hundred thousand !
how much is that ?
winner six !
everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips , but the black man gets the nickel , is that it ? did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips ? do i look like chicken george to you ?
no , sir .
you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll , is that right ? are you a racist ?
no , i just assumed ...
did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because i 'm black ?
those are five hundred dollar chips .
what the hell is that ?
mr. tan is not to be disturbed by the help .
last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced . tonight i 'm doing superfreak , i do n't care what he says . where is he ?
wait .
i got held up at a wedding in tai koo . ricky here yet , i need to get his requests .
the band has been playing over an hour .
i 'm with the band . i 'm the lead singer .
invitation , please .
all right , kenny . thanks . you 're off the hook . for now .
i knew it . the guy 's name is zing . he works at the kitchen at reign plaza .
one of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week . i was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up , when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing . including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills . i knew something was wrong . cause this guy 's got a regular job , no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash . but i tested the bills , infrared . the whole thing . and they checked out . 100 % .
what ?
yeah . we already been there . this is big , kenny . benjamins . secret service calls 'em superbills . banks ca n't even tell the difference .
i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too , did n't you ?
so tell me what you know .
you 've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning . how come you always save me for last , james ? when are you gon na learn . shit do n't happen i do n't know about .
how 'd you know ?
is this about the funny money ?
look , i need some info and i do n't have time to play around .
i 'd like to see you try .
jail ! ? james , you better back off . badge or no badge , i 'll kick your ass .
little chang is gon na have to go visit his daddy in jail if you do n't cooperate .
james , you see my kids back there ? you know how much i 'm paying for private school ? how can you come in here with this attitude , you being little chang 's godfather ?
and i got mine , meaning you . nice how that works out . i 'm serious this time , i 'm closing this place down .
i got my sources .
what ? ? where 'd you hear that ?
hear you got your ass kicked in hong kong , james .
the real question is , where are the plates ? if we can find the plates , we can stop the whole operation .
what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money ?
they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red -- the real ink burns black .
in 1959 , the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran . we wanted his oil , so for the shah 's birthday , the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press . the only one to ever leave the country . five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market .
how 're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses ?
it 's much more than a counterfeit . 14 out of 15 world banks ca n't tell the difference . the paper is crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on u.s. intaglio presses .
it 's a myth . some kind of counterfeit .
they think i 'm a crooked customs agent .
so what 's your story ?
look , i 've been working this case for months now ...
we need to get out of sight . come down to my suite .
yeah , that 's right .
how do we know you 're not lying ? let me see your badge .
i 'm an undercover agent for the united states secret service .
throw us in jail ? i 'm about to bust you right now .
you see , no bomb . now stay away before i throw you both in jail for obstruction .
your friend 's ship ? oh , man . i must 've walked onto the wrong yacht . i knew there was a reason my keys did n't work .
i 'm sure , because this is my friend 's yacht . and it 's his party .
red dragon ? you sure about that ?
the s.s. minow johnson . funny , the name on the back was `` red dragon . ''
called ? what 's my ship called ? well ... it 's called the s.s. minnow johnson .
well , i 'm very tempted . it 's such a beautiful yacht . what 's it called ?
i do n't want to play games with you , isabella . i like you . i can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes .
el capitan ?
that 's right . i 'm the owner , the captain -- you can call me el capitan .
this is your ship ?
i 'm sorry , you looked like you traveled in the best circles . but hey , i understand . make yourself at home , isabella . champagne , caviar , whatever you want . my ship is your ship .
i do n't think so .
san juan ! you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo .
isabella molina , from san juan . that seat is taken .
how you doing , baby ? my name is prince mubutu from nigeria .
c'mon , lee . he 's going to jail . you won , now just put the gun down .
do you have it in you , lee ? or are you gon na spend the rest of your life hiding like your father ?
lee , you okay ?
would you like me to tell you how your father died ?
i ai n't his partner , i 'm a tourist . i got proof . see , i got a mini-bar key .
could you have your partner wait for us outside ?
that 's chief inspector , he got promoted .
it 's no problem . but i must excuse myself , inspector .
i 'd like to pay you for that laptop .
i do n't think so ...
let 's go . i 've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me .
i 'm lee 's new muscle , his right arm -- and do n't let the robe fool you . this is the only color they had left . now get up !
i know you , detective carter , right ? you 're lee 's american friend . enjoying your visit ?
i said get on your feet !
i 'm busy at the moment .
she is nice . but i am very tense . i 'm gon na need a lot of massages . i 'll take that one , too . how you doin ' , baby ? and ... that one in pink . she can do my feet .
oh yes , she 's very nice .
any girl ? okay . let 's start with that one .
you pick any girl for you and your friend .
no . it 's my first time .
you get massage from chinese girl before ?
never leave home without it . lee , this one 's on me . you save your money .
you bring american money ?
that 's right .
oh , you american ?
you play games with me , detective , and you 'll lose every time . do n't forget . the odds are always in favor of the house .
you 're right , you 're a smart guy . most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar . but this is an even swap . pure genius .
vegas has been my town for 30 years . i crawled out from under the first rock . do you really think you can intimidate me here ?
lem me ask you something , steven . and i want the truth . is there any way i can date your daughter ? just dinner and a movie , maybe go listen to some jazz ...
detective carter , you always seem to show up where you do n't belong .
stevie , how 's it going my man ? somebody get a picture , we can use it for a mug shot .
i 'm just in town for the weekend , taking in the sights .
wait a second . you 're steven reign ? you 're big time . you own all them big hotels . what are you doing in hong kong ?
amen to that , brother .
i could use a little vacation .
some kung-pao ?
a little mu-shu .
the plaza hotel ?

i always wanted to go to madison square garden . see the knicks play .
come on , lee . stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up . there must be something you want .
this money is evidence .
they owe us , man . that 's the least they can do .
it 's okay , i got lots more .
no , carter . i ca n't take this .
about fifty grand . i won it at the tables .
what is this ?
it 's okay . i can finally let it go .
your father 's badge ? no way , man . i ca n't take this .
you take care of yourself , lee .
i guess so . thank you , carter .
i 'm this way . i guess this is goodbye .
yes .
that your gate down there ?
she 's going home to new york . i need some ice .
i saw that . she kissed you , did n't she ? you played it cool , though . walking away , never looking back .
no problem .
we made it , man .
it 's worth it to me .
lee , wait a second . it 's not worth it , man . he 's making you do this .
just go !
carter ...
you go after ricky . i got this .
we have to get to the penthouse .
what ? ! ? !
ricky tan is alive .
yes i did . i said mmmmmm !
no you did n't !
i did !
why did n't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth ?
mmmmmm ! ! ! !
lee !
i 'll give it my best shot .
try to keep them busy for five minutes .
i 'll go to the craps table , make a big scene . when security comes over , you make your move .
wait a second . there 's guards all over the place . you 'll need a distraction .
no . i 'm going to find out .
isabella ? are you crazy , man ? she almost got us killed . she 's setting you up again !
it was isabella . she says the plates are in the soft count room .
dancing ? i 'm out here trying to strong arm steven reign , putting my life on the line , and you 're up here dancing with some bimbo . did she have a friend ?
dancing ?
lee , what the hell are you doing ?
wait here . i 'll handle this .
carter ... here comes the rich white man .
buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy . the man has the biggest tits in asia .
buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune .
that looks exactly like my uncle darrell .
yes . we have lots of big men chasing us .
couple ? no , you got it wrong , there 's no couple here . just two single police officers working a very dangerous case .
follow me my asian brother .
what is mac out ?
wait a second . we ca n't go in like this . look at this place , we got ta look fly . we got ta mac out .
let 's go .
that was the name of ricky tan 's boat .
red dragon .
lee . i just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash .
vegas ...
do n't you talk about my mama . that 's more like it .
you could never kick my ass . you mama 's boy .
oh no you do n't . do n't you be getting corny on me , lee . i 'll kick your ass from here to compton .
you 've been a good friend , james carter .
end of the line .
we 're slowing down . this must be it .
now that i believe .
yes he did . he also invented the bicycle .
no chinese man discovered electricity .
a chinese man discovered electricity .
benjamin franklin , he discovered electricity .
who 's benjamin ?
hello , benjamin .
i 'll remember that next time i 'm fighting a box .
it 's focus . every opponent has a weak spot . you ignore everything around you , and put all your energy into one perfect strike .
very nice .
go ahead . sing your ass off .
they 'll probably torture us first , shock our privates , then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head .
that depends . how do the fu-cang-long usually kill their victims ?
i knew it . what does she know . you want me to sing something ?
as long as you 're asking ... i think you have a pretty good voice .
forget it . it does n't matter .
are you serious ?
tell me the truth , carter . do you think i have a good voice ?
that 's rough , man . if i do n't get steamed dumplings once a week , i go crazy .
once in a while , steamed dumplings . but only when she was drunk .
steamed dumplings ?
no kung pao chicken . never .
what about a little king pao chicken ?
no mu-shu .
you 're kidding . no sex ? nothing ? no mu-shu ?
there was no sex . she was very traditional . we were waiting until we were married .
how was the sex ?
mind your own business .
if she was the right girl , you 'd be thinking about her .
no .
you thinking about that girl that dumped you ?
fine by me .
i think we should stop talking .
i thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues . they do n't let everybody in .
what 's a chinese heaven ?
is it the same heaven , or is it a chinese heaven ?
yes . we have heaven .
i believe in heaven . you people believe in heaven ?
fine .
i do n't believe in reincarnation . so i wo n't see you in the next world .
see you in the next world .
i wo n't talk to you , you do n't talk to me . we 'll die in peace .
fine with me .
you got that right . and we ai n't brothers . maybe we should just end this right here .
well we 're not friends .
we are not partners . between your daddy , my daddy , and the beating i just took , as far as i can tell all partners get you is dead .
i 'm not used to having a partner .
it does n't matter .
why did you help me ?
i 'm about to be killed and you `` shhh '' me ! this was n't my case , lee . ricky tan did n't kill my father , the fu-cang long are not in south central . i did n't have to help you .
shhh , my head hurts .
look , man i 'm sorry . i know you got a thing for her .
for how long ? face it , lee , she 's playing both sides .
she saved our lives .
what 's the first thing i told you -- never trust nobody . how could you fall for that shit ? i knew she was dirty .
are you okay ?
snoopy is about six inches taller than you . i 'm sorry , lee , you never had a chance .
i am not third world ugly . women like me , they think i 'm cute . like snoopy .
you 're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me . i 'm tall , dark and handsome , you 're third world ugly .
she never even looked at you .
they do n't know that . what are they gon na do , try and shoot the president during the interview ? i 'll bet isabella can pull some strings . you saw the way she was staring at me .
we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else .
secret service agent carter . this is my calling , lee . give me six months and i 'll be in washington protecting a white guy .
we can help you . i 'm a detective in hong kong .
let me see it again ?
it 's a bomb .
i would n't do that ! ! !
take it !
get it out of here !
there 's people up here !
wait ! there 's people down there !
i do n't need a turn !
it 's your turn !
pick it up !
she 's walking back towards the door .
i do n't understand ?
no , i do n't believe this shit -- it 's a microphone . lee , she 's wired ...
what is it ?
she 's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg . oh , god ... please do n't let it be a dick .
what ?
wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs ?
she just took her hair down . now she 's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she 's using both hands . you better get that ice .
snoopy ? i love snoopy .
skirt just came off . she 's in black bra and panties -- victoria secret spring catalogue , page 27 -- wait a sec - there 's a tattoo on her left thigh ... it looks like snoopy .
i do n't want to hear this .
oh , sweet glory hallelujah ...
what 's she doing ?
gim me the binoculars or i will shoot you .
no . it 's not right .
gim me the binoculars .
she 's getting undressed .
what 's going on ?
i 'm gon na go in the hall and get a bucket of ice . you want some ice ?
hot ? i 'm freezing my ass off .
is it hot in here ?
nothing . i said nothing .
what did you say ?
slow down , baby .
i 'll try to stay awake . it 's so boring .
just do n't fall asleep . sooner or later something 's gon na happen .
she 's just standing around -- not doing much .
she hated my voice . said it drove her crazy . i sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - i thought she liked it . she finally told me it was driving her crazy .
excuse me ?
no . it was my singing .
let me guess , she could n't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive . i 've seen it a million times .
it 's a long story .
i 'm sorry , lee . why did she leave you ?
my fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding .
you pull a muscle or something ?
the truth is , i have n't had any mu-shu in six months .
hey , i did n't mean to call you pathetic .
carter , there 's something i have to tell you . you were right about what you said in hong kong . all i do is work . never take a day off . it 's all i have right now .
look at her . now , wake me in an hour , i 'll take over .
how do you know ?
he 'll be back soon .
he just left . kissed her on the cheek .
yeah , that 's definitely the woman from ricky tan 's boat , and she 's staying in his suite at his hotel , i told you this would work out . they still just talking ?
the same place you find all richwhitemen . gefilte fish . lox and bagel . i love this stuff . here , try it with a smear .
just tell me where i can find this steven reign .
yeah , what about when godzilla was coming ? you people were screaming your asses off .
maybe . but not like asians . we never panic .
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down .
you sound like that all the time .
because when the shooting started he was way too cool . see most white people , when there 's shooting , they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like `` aaaahhh ! ! ! aaaahh ! ! ! !
how do you know he 's our man ?
big hotel billionaire . he was on ricky tan 's boat ordering hu li around just before ricky got smoked .
who ?
not bad . now every crime , somewhere , has a rich white man taking his cut . every single one . now in our case , we know the rich white man is steven reign .
follow the richwhiteman ...
almost , but you 've got to say `` rich white man '' all run together like it 's one word .
follow the rich white man ?
lee , let me introduce you to the carter theory of criminal investigation : follow the rich white man .
i should go back . ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor ...
i guess you 're going to have to trust me on this one .
why la ?
you want to figure out why they killed your daddy , get on the plane .
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father 's death , i 'd go to hell to do it .
you said --
it sounds impossible --
i can not go to la ...
come on , we still got time to order the kosher meal . always get the kosher meal , they bring it first .
what ?
so are you getting on the plane or not ? !
i know . i know . i am sorry .
it is crazy !
i thought you 'd think it was crazy .
you thought the `` customs agents get blown up '' and `` smuggling '' and `` ricky tan '' and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case . that 's why you did n't tell me what we were doing ...
no , no , that would be crazy --
this is about your daddy 's death ? hell , lee , you know my father died on the job . you could have told me ... this is about more than all that , is n't it ? this is about your daddy 's last case , right ?
all the evidence against him disappeared , the smuggling case was unsolved . tan resigned and went over to the triads openly .
how the hell did tan get away with it ?
he found out his partner , tan , had been working for the triads all along . before my father could prove it , he was killed in the line of duty .
ask me if i give a shit .
five years ago , my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case .
forget it .
good at what ?
you 're not very good at this , are you ?
no . she 's a school teacher .
i heard your mama pulls a rickshaw .
do n't be talking about my mama . or my ass !
give me your best shot , you flat assed mama 's boy .
i 'll bitch slap you into bangkok .
what are you gon na do about it , grasshopper ?
what the hell is going on here ?
remember i told you my father was a policeman ? ricky tan was his partner for ten years .
why the hell should you believe him ? he had us beat up . naked . that 's nasty shit .
i 'm okay , you go .
what , leave you alone so he can cap you ?
nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth .
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth ?
who ?
not yu . you !
detective yu ? never met him .
you .
who died ?
carter ?
and you ai n't black !
you would never understand my life . you 're not chinese .
really ? when 's the last time you had some mu-shu let 's hear it , lee , when was it ? year of the rat ?
i have plenty of dates .
you 're pathetic , man . when 's the last time you had some fun ? when 's the last time you took a night off , had a date ?
it 's my job !
my bullshit ? i 'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters ! i 'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords !
stop ! i 'm sick of your bullshit !
why you mad at me ? you needed back-up , so i backed you up . i was about to take out ricky tan and those bodyguards .
fine . go home . who needs you .
back to heaven on earth . i need my damn passport back . i 'm going home .
where are you going ?
do n't look at my ass !
goddamn you got a small ass .
i 'm calling for back up !
i 'm a dangerous man . you 're not gon na ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat .
this is a very dangerous man .
that 's ricky tan ? he 's four feet tall . i 'll go over with you right now , shake him down .
over there -- that 's ricky tan .
what 's wrong ?
hey ! you do n't break in front of a black man in a buffet line .
well , hurry up .
she said i could pick any girl i want .
what are you doing ?
my friend is on vacation , from america . i want to show him a good time .
how you doin ' ?
hello .
i am a tourist .
just follow my lead and act like a tourist .
carter ... you ready to have some fun ! ?
and that 's how you use the lapd choke hold . now start practicing and do n't make me come back here !
this wo n't take long .
i 'm telling you right now , i 'm tired of this shit . there 's two billion chinese - let one of them be your partner .
no time . there was an explosion at the american embassy today -- two american translators were killed .
you 're sorry . i got somebody 's old chopsticks stuck in my ass , so do n't tell me you 're sorry . just take me home .
i 'm sorry .
you lied to me .
try to land on your feet .
all i wanted was a little mu-shu .
shit . c'mon , get up here and help me out .
you just said you 're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking .
what 'd i say ?
you mean tito . we had toto for dinner last night .
no . you are a civilian . in china , i am michael jackson , and you are toto .
man , are you crazy ? you think that scares me ? i 'm from l.a. we invented gangs . we were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it . we get royalties from other gangs . now gim me your badge and gun and i 'll show you how it 's done .
carter , you do n't understand . these men are fu-cang-long triads . part of the most deadly gang in china .
tread softly ? who taught you how to roost a bar ?
no , we 're here for information , to find out where a man named ricky tan is . we must tread softly and keep our ears open .
damn it , why are you ruining my night ? i 'm just starting to have fun . well fine then , go ahead , pull your badge and do your thing .
i 'm sorry .
i knew you were lying .
this is a gangster bar , we 're here undercover .
are you kidding , they love me . i 'm a star , lee . a god to these people !
carter , get off that stage !
bathroom .
blend in ? i 'm two feet taller than everyone here . where you going ?
i 'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes . they do n't like tourists in here , so try to blend in .
take this . it 's a magnum . you can fold it in half .
no .
just relax and do n't worry about a thing . i 'll hook you up in there . you got condoms ?
you better take one . your breath has been a little funky all day . let me look at you .
no .
that 's what i 'm talking about . a real hong kong night club . you want an altoid ?
carter , would i lie to you ?
do n't be messing with me , lee . i will kick your ass . i 'll hit you so hard you 'll end up in the ming dynasty .
of course not . my superindendent invited us to a club tonight . big party .
not mu-shu . mu-shu . i want to see some women . now stop playing dumb and show me the shu !
mu-shu ? you 're hungry ?
do n't be giving me attitude , lee . i 've been here three days and we have n't done shit . we have n't been to a club , have n't even talked to a girl . i 'm on vacation , and i want some mu-shu .
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits , volume two .
i said that ? which word was `` goat ? ''
you invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat .
all i did was invite them for a drink .
those girls drove off because of you .
did you see the way those girls drove off ? i did you a favor .
that was my cd . do n't you ever touch a chinese man 's cd .
i warned you about playing that shit when i 'm in the car .
fine with me .
stay out of it , carter . you 're going back to l.a .
hey , you , secret service man , what are you --
i do n't know if the fu-cang-long paid you to get rid of tan , or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you 're off this case . i do n't ever want to see you again , you got that ?
what `` revenge '' is he talking about ?
quite a night , inspector . ricky tan was our only bait , and now he 's gone . you finally got your revenge - at the expense of a u.s. government investigation .
now you know .
i did n't know which side you were on .
i 'm fine .
are you okay ?
no . but i 'll help you .
i 'm asking for real now -- will you help the secret service ?
dip me !
how do i know i can trust you ?
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao , but the place burned down before we could move in .
if i 'm wrong then my cover is blown .
why do n't you go get them ?
behind me is the soft count room . we 're pretty sure the plates are back there .
look over there . that 's the eye in the sky room .
just trying to make it look real .
you move well .
i 'm undercover . i had no choice . you have to trust me .
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck .
i need your help .
what 's going on ?
excuse me ?
put your arms around me .
yes . they 've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars , and there 's only one way to spot a fake .
and hu li killed him for the plates .
it was n't hard to spot the fakes until this past year . then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills .
no . it 's a sample . you guys ever heard of the superbill ?
is this a payoff ?
then you know i 'm not walking away from this case .
i know who you are , inspector lee .
i still have my lunch money from third grade .
do you still have the bills ?
that 's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking . never shut up .
baby duck ?
what are you doing hanging out with baby duck ?
no . freddy ching 's , in crenshaw .
the praying mantis school , in bejing ?
master ching taught me .
i 'll take him .
escort detective carter to the airport --
thank you .
let him find out on his own . i want the hong kong police handling this .
did you tell sterling ?
lee , we just got a call from the harbor patrol . ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight . victoria harbor . if you do n't want to ...
are you okay , lee ?
all he wanted was some mu-shu .
the secret service ? why ?
lee , this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service .
it 's my responsibility .
we think it 's ricky tan . if you do n't want to take the case , i 'll understand .
any leads ?
lee , there was a bombing at the american embassy . two american translators were killed .
do n't you remember ? i 'm already dead .
if you reach for that gun , i 'm going to kill you .
i do n't think it 's over . there are casinos all over this country . let me make you a rich man , lee . do n't make the same mistake he did .
put the plates down . it 's over .
you 're just like your father , lee . all these years hiding behind his badge . i wanted to help him , to share with him , but he was too afraid of change . when you think about it , i did n't really kill him . i just put him out of his misery .
there is a ship , in the hong kong harbor ...
tell me why they killed the customs agents .
nobody can protect me . i 'll make a deal with you , lee . but only iff you 'll get me out of hong kong .
the police can protect you .
... if your father were alive , i would be turning to him now . i did n't blow up the american embassy , but i believe some of my people did . my enemies are trying to frame me . there is a war going on within the triads -- and i am going to lose . my name has been written into the book of death .
do n't .
despite what people suspect ... what you suspect --
you must come with me for questioning .
lee , i 've missed you , brother . i heard about the two americans , i 'm so sorry , you must be under great pressure .
it 's a massage parlor downtown . `` heaven on earth . '' you will find your answers there .
heaven on earth ? master , i do n't understand . a temple , where heaven is on earth ? a mountain , where earth reaches for the --
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth .
i know , master , but ...
a seeding spends its entire life reaching towards heaven .
no . your father . your father and ricky tan were my favorite students ... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
ricky tan ?
he was the best i ever trained , you know .
animals kill only from hunger or fear . the man you seek is lower than a serpent . ... he kills for money .
i need your help , master . i 'm seeking a man who used to train with you . he 's become a killer - the worst kind of animal .
yes , master .
did n't i teach you to always arch your back ?
put a diaper on him , chin . i want to talk to the great inspector lee .
that is ... chief inspector lee . the detective in charge of our investigation .
who the hell is that ?
no . he will report to me . do we understand each other ?
chief inspector lee will brief your people ...
two americans have been killed on united states government property -- this is our investigation .
this is still hong kong .
chin , you have been ordered by the ministry of public security to assist the fbi and secret service with our investigation , to provide us with whatever we need . if you have information , it belongs to us .
the ambassador will receive instructions for the drop , half an hour before it is to be made . if it is successful , there will be more . thank you , agent carter .
ok. say what it is .
shut up !
hey , that 's whacked ! i thought we was gettin ' on here !
carter . i just want to be able to tell the ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much .
that 's cool . we 're gettin ' to know each other . this is a good thing . i 'm carter .
what is your name ?
that 's some serious poundage in dollars .
in used currency . nothing bigger than a fifty .
fifty million ! are we talkin ' united states dollars ?
the first drop will be made tomorrow . at twelve o'clock . the amount will be fifty million .
lee ! it 's him !
the bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity . if you want the ambassador 's daughter back alive , listen and do not talk .
you know what a phone booth is ? !
do i look like i 'm movin ' ? ! what you 're seeing here ? this is not movement . this is my `` still '' .
you do n't move , you understand ? ! you do n't move !
do n't push it . you better watch your ass with these fed types . if there 's a screw-up , they wo n't think twice about burnin ' it .
and that , of course , would be me .
they asked for the best street man i had .
feds asked for me ?
i got a call from the f.b.i . the daughter of the chinese ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help . you 're it .
hey , sir , it was a pleasure to preserve johnson 's ass . well ... you know what i mean .
good job .
that 's probably the only reason johnson 's still alive .
i know , but --
what you did was dangerous and completely outside policy .
sir , i can explain .
i do n't know what went wrong last night , but this department could 've lost one detective and our only explosives expert .
so was i .
he was just doing his job .
tell me about it .
he 'll be ok. russ is a tough son of a bitch .
i 'm gon na arrest the sonuvabitch ! your ass is goin ' to jail !
this is pathetic .
he stole my wheel !
carter .
ooo , there 's a chill . love that .
oh , i think you like this very much .
no shark fin , no camel hump . what you listenin ' to ?
it 's hong kong , not tokyo . my country asked for the best . i told them that was you . now i will show you around my hood .
fbi calls up my ass , says they need help in tokyo . like i 'm supposed to drop everything .
what a surprise !
you know him ?
oh my god . griffin .
hey , do n't worry . nothing 's gon na happen to it .
no , it is china , my country , my history . if any of it gets damaged ...
the art .
what ?
oh no .
well , i ai n't goin ' to china . and neither are you .
what are you doing here ?
be sorry for soon young . she has no chance now .
i 'm sorry , lee .
i 'm sorry .
you drop my gun and you lose my i.d . ?
oh no , i dropped it .
oh yes .
no , wait . i do n't have it . you have it .
it ai n't your ass , it 's my ass you 're backin ' up . take the damn gun .
no , please , i do n't --
i am sorry , but i have too much respect for women .
like that .
no , like a tourist . you know , things to see , money to burn , interested in stupid shit .
i am from outa town .
ok , when you go in , just act like you 're from outa town .
what do you hear ?
this concrete ? this is still america .
this is my territory now . you are my responsibility .
going into the restaurant .
which one ?
it 's him .
what ? !
nobody in america eats fish in the am . we 're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type .
excuse me ?
no , fish is a pm food .
want some ?
i got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours .
are you ok ?
no ! you hate me . look , i 'm gon na do it one time . that 's it .
good god , ya 'll !
not yee-aw , ya 'll . and it 's got ta be angry . like you 're pissed off .
yee-aww .
no , no . it 's not good-god you all ! it 's good-god , ya 'll . ya 'll !
yes , i think so .
that 's not how it goes .
who does not know war ? war , hhh , wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh . what is it good for ? absolutely nothing . good-god , you all .
you know war ?
yes , i know this song .
now , that 's american music .
no , no . i 'm full . too much fin and hump , you know , gives me gas . scuse me .
you want more ?
that one is my favorite . chicken puff with shark fin .
yeah , it 's good .
you like it ?
juntao 's standing orders were to kill everyone . there were never witnesses .
are you tellin ' me nobody knows what he looks like ? come on , there must be witnesses somewhere .
that is a problem . there is no description of juntao . no known photograph .
let 's get us a photo and description . we 'll have an apb out while we stake out the restaurant .
it happens .
thank you . i learn a great deal .
you see what i 'm sayin ' ? you control the space .
took off . yes . they took off .
let 's go . everybody take off ?
come on !
you talk too fast .
yeah , somethin ' like that . ok , now this is a nasty ass place . when you go into a place like this , the most important thing is control . you got to maintain control . you following me ? you lose it , you get hurt . now , you 're my responsibility and i do n't want you hurt . you understand ? ok , let 's go .
stool pigeon .
what ?
stooly .
when we go inside , you let me handle everything , you hear ? this is my man , you dig ? my informant . you know what an informant is ?
yes . he was part of the juntao crime family . he may be juntao himself . and he dropped this .
alright , listen , no bullshit just tell me straight : did you really know the guy you were chasin ' ?
hey , everybody fits in here . look at l.a. , man . nobody 's from here . my momma 's from detroit , my dad 's from atlanta , they met in texas , got married in vegas and i was born in alabama . so where the hell am i from ? kenya ?
i also did not come because i think i would not fit in america .
hey , stop . we 're just gon na wind up in some bar , drinking ' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you 'll start singin ' beach boy songs again . then i 'll really get depressed .
i could not come . i had other responsibilities .
do n't go there ...
i worked with ambassador han and his family for ten years . he wanted me to come with them to america . if i had , this might not have happened .
no . i just made it up .
what is that , some kind of chinese proverb ?
when a man steps in dung , it is obvious . there is no need to rub it in his face . the smell is the same .
bullshit ! you were trying ' to lose my ass again .
it was a man i was after in hong kong .
yeah , sure , you got lots a enemies in l.a. after what ? six hours ?
he was trying to kill me , not you .
it was my ass that almost got trashed !
did you make the plate ? !
what the hell kinda cop are you ? !
no .
the license ! you get it ? !
what plate ?
you make the plate ?
you do n't know what a shortcut is ?
shortcut ?
i know a shortcut .
what about them ?
let me just clarify a few things . i do n't care what kind of cop you are in china , you have no jurisdiction in america . without me you are just another tourist .
mr. carter , i appreciate your desire to show me a good time , but that is not the reason i am here .
right ... .
it was not my intent --
you 're a regular god damn acrobat , are n't you ? bet you feel real good makin ' me look like an asshole .
oh yeah , but this is on the way . and you got ta see john wayne 's footprints . everybody does . it 's almost like a law . you ca n't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big . tiny god damn feet !
i thought you were taking me to the consulate .
wait . you hungry ? you got ta be hungry , you just flew in from china . and what 'd they feed you , chinese food , right ? then you got ta be hungry . hell , it does n't matter , i 'm hungry . we 'll get some food on the way to the consulate .
witnesses .
where were we ?
well do n't do that . polite do n't work here . you do that polite shit here in america , they 'll sue your ass for harassment .
i was being polite .
that silly-ass look on your face .
what ?
-- what the hell is that ?
look , you want to work in this country , you got ta know this crap . okay ? we 're gon na be in some deep shit here . working the danger zone . and you need insurance . cause , you know , you might be starting some riots and shit .
i am afraid i do n't understand the importance of this information .
yeah , that 's right . now that we understand each other ... show me how you did that .
we are both full of shit .
okay , fine , you 're full a shit , i 'm full a shit .
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking . you seemed as if you liked to talk . i like to let people talk who like to talk . it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are .
you 're full of shit . do you understand what i 'm saying to you ? full of shit ?
i am not responsible for your assumptions .
it 's the same thing !
i did n't say i did n't . you assumed i did n't .
bullshit a little . you lied to me .
a little .
you speak english !
yeah , well you 're in american now . everybody 's got guns . that tricky shit with your hands is gon na get your ass shot to hell .
no .
you have one of these ?
let me give you a piece of advice : never touch another man 's radio . you do it again , nobody , not rhonda , not yolanda , gon na save your ass .
help me rhonda .
beach boy america . help me rhonda , help me get her out of my --
you 're shittin ' me . you know the beach boys ? !
beach boy .
okay , i 'll slow down . so we go downtown and we ask you a few questions ... you know , like what 's your name ? how old are you ? you ever expose yourself in public ... shit like that .
you talk very fast .
absolutely . i 'll even let you ride in the front seat .
how about a lift home ?
not to me . never to me .
look at me ! my dress is ruined . i look like shit .
yeah . so why you look do down ?
we saved the girl and got the bad guys , did n't we ?
you ok ?
it 's okay . for restaurants .
you do n't like it ?
that 's it ! you can attack me , but when you attack my car , i can not forgive ! you in the back , girl !
yeah , if you 're superfly .
what ? ! this is a class ride , johnson .
wait a minute . i 'm not riding in that .
it 's called you 're gon na kill me . what 're you doin ' with that on ?
it 's called a dress .
oh my god ... what happened to you ?
alright , johnson , thank you . so ... what are you wearing ?
this is my city . i 'm a cop . i 'll find em .
this whole thing is goin ' down tonight . i need to know where the ambassador is gon na be . the feds will be keepin ' a lid on everything . you thing you can do that ?
jesus ... what do you want ?
listen , this ai n't about us ! it 's about a thirteen year old girl . she 's not gon na make it . unless we do something .
you made a fool out of me ! in front of the fbi !
yes i do . that 's all i got . guts and you , johnson . there 's no one else i can trust .
you got a lot of guts calling me .
no way in the way ! i 'm talkin ' back up , johnson . i 'm in charge ! and i need you , baby .
well.. i would n't want to be in the way .
ok. well ... make us proud . and be careful .
oh baby , do n't worry , i 'll call you . you can count on it .
well ... listen , if you need any help , you know , back up , call me , ok ?
in charge . just me'n him . no interference . they do n't even want to hear from us until we 're done . i love the f.b.i . i love the f.b.i .
they put you in charge ?
oh , you 're not gon na believe what they put me in charge of . they sent for the ambassador 's personal chinese investigator type . he is like the baddest asian shield they got . and i , let me repeat that , i am the man who is on the case with him . just the two of us , alone , workin ' the whole deal as a team .
with the fbi . what do you think i 'm talking about ?
how 'd what go ?
i would n't be close to you . what is that perfume , girl ?
what 's wrong with that ?
i could get promoted right out of here .
no ... what ?
way he put it , i was the only one he thought could handle it . but you know what the worst thing is ?
fbi needs a taste of the street . and i 'm it .
the feds ? !
hey , baby , it 's cool . captain just reassigned me to the feds .
hey , i was senior . it 's ok. this is why i get the big bucks .
last night 's as much my fault as yours . if he 's gon na put the blame on anybody --
oh , baby , you cruel ...
carter , just because you saved my butt , does n't mean it 's yours .
you 're killin ' me here .
where 'd you get it ?
not anymore .
good . that 's standard military packaging for plastique . get a look under it .
yeah ... beautiful . what would you call that paper there ? kind of a ... robin egg blue color ?
and your buddy , mr. lee , is on his way back to china . now , get out . before i file obstruction of justice charges against you .
what ? !
i 'm not interested , carter . you 're no longer on this assignment .
okay , let me start from the top . a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine . now , after the shit blew up last night ...
no , sir . i 'm as good as it gets .
why do n't you try the assignment . or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it ?
oh yeah . the caller was a man . confident . had an accent . my guess , asian . anything else i can do for the fbi , sir ?
eleven thirty tomorrow the ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is . he said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity .
do n't play bullshit games with me .
hmmmm ?
that 's what you were supposed to be !
hey , man , you can use her . she 's an expert !
you think this is funny , carter ? you send for someone from explosives ! ? four men just died in there !
yo , johnson ...
carter , shut up !
you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?
try a bus load of - no , make that two bus loads of chinese --
what do you mean you lost him ? ! how could you lose him ? !
just make him think you 're following leads . interview some suspects , look at fingerprints , do detective shit . i do n't care . i just do n't want to see him- or you , for that matter- until this is resolved . now , we want to make a good impression , do n't we ? his plane lands in an hour . do n't be late .
what the hell am i supposed to do with him ? take him to the zoo ?
because with your special talents , i 'm sure you 'll do a better job .
why do n't you assign one of your own men to this ?
bottom line : i do n't want some chung king cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident .
what kind of assignment is that ?
do n't worry about the kidnapping , carter , the f.b.i . will handle that . your assignment is lee .
i 'm talking about the girl .
he is the situation .
sir , he 's just gon na get in my way . if i 'm gon na handle this situation ...
... the director considers this top priority , considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances . his name is lee . and he is to be shown every courtesy . within reason .
interrogation is one a my specialties , but undercover work is my forte .
you come highly recommended , carter . and your particular assignment requires a special talent .
how much they want ?
at this point we do n't have much .
any demands yet ?
you do n't . he finds you . through his people .
where do we find him ?
i 'm waitin ' here for a name .
you sonuvabitch .
all i got ta do is implicate . the feds can do a lot with a good implication . even if you do n't get sparky , i 'll bet you get ten to twenty more . plenty of time to find a nice fella .
how did i do this ? ! maybe you did n't notice but i 'm in jail !
you 're movin ' to death row . see , your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents . and when i turn this into the lab , they 're gon na find lafontaine all over it . and we already know ... ... this is your mo .
what are you talking about ?
you got a boy friend in here yet ? cause you 're gon na need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye .
do it !
okay , look , we 're gon na make a trade . you cross the street , leave her on the sidewalk . i will leave him on this side . then we trade places . you get him , i get her . get the picture , lois ?
i would n't touch that if i were you .
what 's this little green wire coming out one side of the package ?
what are you talking about ?
you know something ? every time i see this stuff , it reminds me of ... uh ... a double latte grande ... with two shots of non-fat milk .
shit , i ai n't interested in puttin ' my hands on you . that does nothin ' for me . no . i do n't need to be pattin ' no ass . all i 'm sayin ' is , how do i know you 're not a cop ?
nobody touches me .
i oughta pat your ass down . make sure you 're not a cop .
i do n't trust anybody . especially first time deals .
this is not a good way to start a relationship , stickin ' a gun to a man 's head , feelin ' around his personal equipment . make him think you do n't trust him .
or somethin ' .
you a cop or something ?
shut up !
hey , hey , you start touching me there , i 'm gon na start movin ' ! word up , mother ...
i want to speak with my daughter !
take the money with you tonight . pack it in six dragons . you will be contacted again .
hello .
please , you must understand , what happened today was not --
you have run out of time . the amount now is two hundred million . i will call later with instructions . you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter .
yes .
can i speak with her ?
she 's fine .
my daughter .
even if you deny the fbi is there , i will assume you are lying .
yes .
ambassador han .
hello .
pack it into black garbage bags . throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the fang shan restaurant in china town . you have twenty-nine minutes left .
i do .
you have what i asked for ?
yes .
griffin ? where are you .
it 's griffin .
yes .
han ?
hello .
do n't worry , he 's with carter .
and mr. lee ? where is he ?
yes sir , me too . the state department has authorized release of the funds . we 'll have to make the first drop at 7. as soon as they pick up the money , we 've got em .
i am so sorry about your men .
carter , can i have a moment ?
come on . let 's get you some dry clothes .
he is already on the plane . i hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me .
i understand , sir . but you are an honored guest of the united states ...
i am not an american , mr. russ . my daughter is not an american .
as i said , sir , we 've got all the people we need .
he is very good .
ambassador , let me assure you that the fbi has made this a top priority . we have plenty of manpower on the case .
i would like one of my people to help .
soon young , do n't worry . you will have many friends very soon . you will see . america is a very friendly place .
i will not have friends in america .
after i left ?
i was trying to find the right time .
i do n't believe you . my father was explaining to mr. griffin . that is how i found out .
i still have work to do here .
when were you going to tell me you were not going with us ?
let me take you back inside , okay ?
yes .
i lead maggie through a visualization exercise . all the sports shrinks use this head stuff . visualize the end zone , if you catch my drift .
right .
i 've got news for you . no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic .
so if you 're not running and ike graham is there to see it , then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending , right ? all we 're doing is turning lemon into lemonade .
i 'm not running .
let him come to the wedding . you 're not running , right ? say it . `` i 'm not ... ''
you do n't understand this guy .
sure i do . but the bet defense is a good offense , right ? you 're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game .
at the wedding ? you invite him ? bob , do n't you realize he 's writing another article about me ?
i 'm just bragging about how great you are . i 'm the luckiest man alive .
bob -- are you making friends with this man ?
ike just came by to check out the team .
what is he up to now ?
maintain eye contact .
got any last minute advice ?
i did n't want to find out i was n't for her in the fourth quarter .
really ?
thank you .
you look awful .
how about -- `` i hope you 'll be very happy together '' ?
what do you expect me to say to this ?
hold it ! hold it ! i think we 're taking this too fast .
at this pace , it could be an evening wedding .
you bet ya , coach .
see you at the wedding .
i 'm the town 's unofficial fitness trainer . big advocate of the mind and body combining for success . you could say or you can quote me , i 'm a glass half full king of guy .
ahh .
of course .
could your confess to father patrick from now on ?
of course .
i 'm happy here , where i 'm supposed to be . but if you ever become a catholic , may i ask you a favor , maggie ?
i 'm really sorry that i hurt you , brian .
weird . like after all those years you would remem --
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs .
god bless you , maggie .
god ... of course . i 'm sorry -- i mean , i 'm ... brian -- i 've got to go . the man 's a lunatic , but i know exactly where he 's going next .
it happens to be how i feel .
good one ! thanks .
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended ?
and what did you say ?
only respectful things . what did we have in common back then ... what kind of music did you like ... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar ...
what did he ask ?
yes , yes , i 'm sure i only did you good , maggie .
what ? you talked to him ! did you tell him we dated before you were a priest ?
actually , he only asked me one ridiculous question . the rest were n't so bad .
he 's here ! ... he 's here !
i 'll get the dress .
we 'll rub .
it 's hurting .
we do it to our dog .
eight is good ... `` v '' could be victory .
and in a `` v '' .
okay -- have a seat ... gently , carefully .
that 's it . back to obedience school .
yes , rubbing your ears is very soothing . cory does that to me when i hyperventilate .
rub your ears .
his hair ... any color .
i love his eyes . i just believe they 're listening to you .
`` never say die . ''
`` nothing but net . ''
`` make the shot . ''
`` sink the putt . ''
do n't be nervous , maggie . let us visualize . remember what bob said ? `` be the ball . ''
bob 's in a hurry .
bob is making her visualize the ceremony .
tell me , why does maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding ? she 's already done this .
where do you think she 's going ?
maggie !
i 'm sorry , too . wow . that only took us between years to say .
well -- i 'm sorry , i 'm really sorry , ellie .
no . no , you did n't .
is that what i did to you ? is that what happened ? did i just not see you ?
but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all . each one was convinced that she was perfect for them , but they did n't see her . and she never showed up so they could n't see her . it 's a very symbolic thing happening . she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be .
fisher , let him talk .
i 'm sorry , ike . this is permanent .
see ? you want custody of my job ? ... why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel i 've served my time ?
i already made an appointment for later today .
lawyers . i do n't know , ellie -- firing me is going to be very tough on you . it 's going to be hard to get over . there will be therapy bills for you .
i merely write the stuff . you 're the one that serves it up .
no , that 's what makes you unemployed .
someone reliable , i 'm sure . a booze- hound in a bar ?
i did n't cook up a story . i had a source .
that 's not nothing to do with it . you cooked this story up and you know it .
lesson number two . never work for your former spouse .
journalism lesson number one . if you fabricate your facts , you get fired .
what ?
-- it 's for you , ike .
so ? i never returned your calls , even when we were married . and what 's fisher doing here anyway ?
i left four messages . you do n't return my calls .
fully . i like her . she has wit .
poor ike .
look , he 's in pretty good shape .
look , he 's running after her .
or does she pick `` ngb 's '' -- `` nice guys , but ... '' nice guys , but i 'm cheap . nice guys , but he lives with his mom ... nice guys , but he just out of prison .
or a vegetarian ?
... just call me when you have it . ike , how is the story coming ? is she a man-eater ?
overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout . that 's new york living .
i just found out i 'm best man ! i 'm lucky i have a suit ... what 's wrong ?
your job is ... the ring . do you have the ring ? !
i have no idea what i 'm doing .
go talk to the pastor and he 'll tell you what to do . and someone will tell me what to do .
well , i 'm good , i do n't know if i 'm best .
then you 'll be my best man .
of course we are . of course .
whoa , ike . getting a complex , buddy ?
no ... they 're interesting guys . each one of these guys has something going for him . i mean , one 's been up everest . another 's become a priest . one 's a pretty good guitar player . and this guy today tried to end world hunger , if you can believe that ...
order out like a philistine , when you got the galloping gourmet here ? ...
okay , we 'll order out .
then come for dinner .
yeah .
you 're coming here ?
look -- i 'll be in there later today . i 'll come by and tell you all about it .
i do n't know .
no , i 'm paying for the dress . do you think she 's still gon na run ?
this is about her negative attention , not mine . did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet ?
yes , well , my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention ... negative attention is attention . like when women whack you on the street because of your column , that 's negative attention .
oh yeah ! i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car .
do n't say `` spec '' like it 's a dirty word . nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play ! plato never got a book advance ...
but i 'll get my normal fee , right ?
justice , yes . paid , i do n't know . they like the idea , but my hands are tied with budget restraints .
`` paid vindication '' that 's what i call justice .
then you 've got it . if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands , you 'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot .
okay , you were right . i hated my column , but i can do this assignment .
if she runs , then it 's a cover story . all true . all accurate .
this is good . it is a good story , fish .
it would n't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again .
the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland .
all the gory details .
the real story on miss carpenter .
vindication . how would you like to get some ? a chance to prove that , though your facts were n't entirely straight , your theory was correct .
what are you trying to say to me , fish ?
ike , i really liked the runaway bride piece , and since i do freelance stuff for g.q. , i 'm in a different position now ...
do n't knock drunk guys in bars . drunk guys in bars are good . it means they 're not driving .
in vino veritas .
since when does ellie need moral supp --
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support .
oh , please !
unbelievable , she got to you .
no . i call it like i see it . i 'm a journalist . i 'm a truth teller .
and you defending her ?
i do n't know . i 'm working on it . i was on the wrong track .
why do you think she ran ?
i do n't think that 's why she ran .
same as you said . what did you call her ? a `` man-eater '' , `` a devouring death goddess . ''
neuter a locust , feed the world .
not bad . i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me .
guess you 'd know about that . you 're an entomologist , right ? how 's business ?
ah , ca n't stay away from her , can you ? like a moth to a flame .
well , i 'm writing another article on the cacophony .
she 's a cacophony of contradictions .
thanks .
and end up in the papers ? i 've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime , thank you . i 'm sorry she got you canned .
you could have told me you were fiance number three .
splendid dissection of maggie carpenter , very professional job .
get this man a kamikaze .
no , i 'm not .
it 's okay . there 's no microphone . you 're no fun .
tootaloo .
well , i 'm off . a reporter 's work is never done . mrs. pressman , thank you .
oh , i will .
good fact . well , you let me know .
i 'm not sure . mr. schullian runs the newsstand , he 's our local bookie , you know , he 's giving eight to one odds she wo n't . he says she 's so famous now , maybe vegas will give odds on her . i 'm going to wait to hear what the pros say .
i know . tell me something . do you think she 's going to make it all the way this time ?
it 's her fourth time to the altar , you know . not seven like they said .
yes , mrs. pressman .
excuse me , sir . i have an actual fact for you .
sorry , no . i just got one .
oh , sure . that was a long time ago . see , she 's not a man-hater at all . she 's very supportive of men ...
it 's nice that they 're still friends .
that must have made you proud .
this game is pretty important to him . he made all-stars in high school , you know .
not yet . i had a phlemless morning . i hear he 's a pretty good ballplayer .
have you listened to his morning show , `` wake up with ballplayer '' ?
no , she 's talking about your hair .
i think you 'd look good in red .
yep . maggie -- someone to see you .
looking for maggie .
and you are ?
peggy phleming . not the ice skater .
i am just such a reporter . and you are ?
no , about her getting that asshole from new york fired .
about her upcoming wedding and all .
it 's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie .
what ?
are you a reporter ?
hello . i 'm looking for maggie carpenter . there was a sign at the hardware store across the street ...
oh , come on . you 're practically family .
thank you .
you should thank lou and i for the wedding car -- a '63 buick .
bye , betty . thanks .
your two cinnamon rolls .
-- the luau for maggie .
oh , betty . i take it you 're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you 're throwing --
betty trout . five dollars .
yes , i am . and who are you ?
got ta tell you this about my daughter . my daughter makes real good time , even in a long dress and heels . maggie may not be hale 's longest running joke , but she certainly is the fastest .
dad 's fishing trip , grandma 's knee operation , grandma 's birthday ...
ah , beautiful . i just ca n't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that .
like her mother .
you know , your daughter seems ...
well , wedding cake freezes . this we know .
gee , i hope they do n't have a fight out there . you do n't think they 'll call it off ... ?
oh , yeah . scared the hell out of skipper .
they made me put my hat back on .
i borrowed it from this guy i know . so ?
pretty good speech , maggie .
`` i guarantee that we 'll have tough times . i guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out . but i also guarantee that if i do n't ask you to be mine , i 'll regret it for the rest of my life . because i know in my heart -- you 're the only one for me '' .
i 'm listening .
i was , because if you said `` yes '' right away , i would n't get to say this next part . and i 've been practicing it . ready ?
you were not .
this is getting serious .
they 're mine . i 'm turning in my running shoes to you .
used ?
i did n't . and you being the one at the end of the aisle did n't just fix that .
yes , i did .
i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ? i was walking toward somebody who did n't have any idea who i really was . and it was only half the other person 's fault , because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted . so it was good that i did n't go through with it because it would have been a lie , but you -- you knew the real me .
does it matter ?
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things .
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career . so , what are you doing here ?
it 's something i 've always wanted to do .
livid is good . so what is it , maggie ? you here on business ? i saw your lamps . they 're terrific .
i do n't have much choice in the matter now , do i ? but i ca n't speak for italics . traitor !
i 've been making friends with your cat . is it okay that i 'm here ?
so , we 'll ...
so am i .
i 'm okay with that .
and the wedding date . there 's the two of us . so , you think ... maybe ... you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back .
and the church .
well , you do have the dress .
yes , you !
me ?
to who ? are you asking me ?
i love you , too .
i love you . i love you .
me , either .
i do n't know . i , uh -- i frankly do n't even want to talk about it .
okay . so ... what , uh ... what just happened ? just now ? jus then ? in there ?
really ?
a little longer for me .
about a minute ... ?
i kissed him back .
i 'm sorry , bob . she kissed me back .
come on , it 'll give you a great view . it 's perfect . hey .
i 'd rather not .
no . no -- actually , let 's make ike the pastor .
no you do n't . you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet . you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem . you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he 's burning to talk to you and he ca n't wait another minute to find out what you 'll say . am i right ?
yes i do !
no , that 's called not having a mind of your own . what are you doing , maggie ? you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon ? you do n't want to climb annapuma .
that 's called changing your mind .
with the priest , you liked them scrambled . with the dead head , fried . with the bug guy , poached . now it 's egg whites only , thank you very much .
what ! ?
that 's right . you 're so lost you do n't even know how you like your eggs .
lost !
supportive ? you were n't being supportive . you were being scared . just like now . you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on .
every one of those times i was being supportive . something you wo n't understand .
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress .
brian told you that ?
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai ?
i already explained about that .
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo ?
that was very interesting research george was doing !
or the sexual habits of locusts ?
it 's fun ! it 's high .
well , they should . because they 're about to watch you hang yourself again .
i had it under control . now they feel sorry for me .
no , maggie , i defended you . humiliating you is what everyone else is doing . it 's the theme of this party .
you humiliated me !
i 'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you .
i do n't and i do n't think you should ...
yes .
are you all right with this ? you think this is funny ?
excuse me ?
i do n't know , give me a minute . are you all right with this ?
missed me bad , huh ?
where did you disappear to ?
yes it is . and it does n't mean anything .
no . but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness . attraction is very misleading . and if it 's mutual , it 's well , terribly distracting .
yeah . it 's kind of nice .
kind of isolated .
wrenches . my dad 's gon na love that one .
of what ?
first i have to find some tools . i need a half and a nine-six-tenth .
can you fix it ?
your filter 's clogged . this takes unleaded .
why do n't you let him sleep it off in the trunk . i 'll take you for a ride . then we 'll come back for him . keep an eye on him .
watch your leg , dad . i 'm so tired of this .
no -- i 'm cleaning an attic . i would n't attempt the impossible .
hmmm ... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album . you 're not trying to soften me up , are you ?
no . you take it .
it 's valuable . hang onto it .
it was in the attic . it was jus sitting there gathering dust .
oh , my god -- it 's miles davis . this is `` king of blue '' ! this is the original recording . hard to find in good condition . where did you find this ?
gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss .
ike ... hi , grandma .
you know , there 's no ...
tell me . when you get to the altar , will you spike the bouquet ?
what was that ? i ca n't order my eggs without sarcasm ?
of course .
i 'll have the same .
bob will be very happy .
fine . the newspaper 's upside down . that 's better than fine .
you look ... uh ... you look fine .
agreed .
even with everything that 's happened i 've still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress .
maybe you should ask her some time . ever thought of that ?
no .
you do n't know .
i do n't know .
now that 's romantic . a proposal like that and you did n't find eternal bliss ? what went wrong ?
no . i think i said something eloquent like , `` so , uh -- maybe we should , ya know . what do you think ? ''
so ? is that what you said to her ?
i 'm a work in progress .
maybe it 's just me , but -- if you got to dress it up , it does n't ring true .
what do you mean ? it was incredibly romantic !
highly suspect .
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life . cal ripken even applauded .
he 's an entomologist ! i thought it was very unique .
it 's a little `` silence of the lambs '' for me . i ca n't believe you waited for the wedding to run .
still sweet .
always a mood killer .
what an incredible chauvinistic observation .
well , i 'm impressed . absolutely incredible . i did n't expect pink and lacy , but this is n't exactly a woman 's room .
no , i 'm not afraid . just ... maybe someday .
you afraid to try ?
maybe someday .
i like it . this whole thing is pretty incredible . i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york .
i think so .
cindy the manicurist .
it 's a birthday present for my cousin . put your finger in .
done .
six-fifty .
five hundred .
seven-fifty .
too much .
because i think you 're writing on spec and with a first person interview , you might actually sell that thing .
you 've seen the post-its . i 've already got more juicy material than i need . why should i pay you dollar one ?
oh , but making up the facts as you go along is ethical ? actually , i meant you . you probably got severance or expenses or both . i 'll take your check . no credit cards .
my magazine does n't pay because for stories . it 's not what you call ethical .
really .
my point is that one again , you 're getting it all wrong . that wo n't improve your reputation any , and it 's not very flattering to me either . so , i 'm going to give you a chance to write the truth .
i 'm not a boastful man . what 's your point ?
you 're welcome . your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction . your observations are distorted , ungrounded an incomplete . you must be very proud .
how do i do it ? i 'm not that beautiful .
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers .
obviously , i 'm not the only one who does n't understand it . the uss maggie leaves quite a wake ... excuse me .
you misinterpret everything . we 've all been friends our whole lives . but that 's the types of relationship you would n't understand .
you can turn that finger around .
you 've been here for three minutes . what did you do to her ?
he is not !
look , look , man . i think the man is heartbroken .
but the most interesting thing here is that i do n't see the rose tattoo that i 've heard about on your back .
give me that !
a pre-wedding luau ?
grandma made me the cutest outfit . i ca n't wait to show it to you .
nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak .
we think so .
how romantic .
without oxygen ...
really ?
twice ...
everest . is that right ?
despite what you think , i do n't do it on purpose . and i have no intention of doing it again .
that 's fair .
i 'd love to stay and chat , but i 've got to get back to work . i still have my job .
we 'll see .
you 're going to be very disappointed .
yes . conviction . conviction that i 'm onto the truth . you 're going to do the same thing to `` poor bastard number four '' that you did to the last three . you 're going to run again . and i 'm not leaving until you do .
did something happen to make you care about reality ?
you have one ?
i 'm not here to make you feel bad . i 'm here for vindication . in my heart ...
yes .
weird dreams ? you 're going to tell me about them ?
nervous ? not at all ! no . i 've never been more certain in my life . except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams .
getting nervous ?
you 'll answer my questions ?
well , instead of a haircut , how about a wash ? you know , get all that city grit out of it .
excellent .
originality is my speciality .
i hope you have a different angle . it 's pretty much all been covered .
quick . very quick .
thank you . you still think that he was ... .
wedding . wedding . you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row .
what are you talking about ?
okay .
no , i 'm just going to head home .
want to go to butch 's for a drink or something ?
i 'm just finishing up , too .
you okay ? i 'm closing .
no sauntering down the aisle . just make time . let 's just get there .
let 's go .
not eight ...
you and your lucky geese . you always see geese .
no , no . i saw eight geese flying in a `` v '' .
he 's not coming . watch . he 's not coming .
see , this is a mature relationship . she 's really found it .
grandma !
it 's for the bell .
... i do n't even want to talk about the luau . what 's this ?
what happened at the luau ?
yep . i want him to be front and center and to watch everything .
he 's going to be the pastor ?
would it ?
i have n't seen him in twenty-four hours . it just gives me the creeps a little bit . i 'd feel better if i knew where he was .
this party is for you and bob . get your mind off the reporter .
lighten up , what ?
lighten up , wahine .
thanks . will you fix my hair ?
you 're right . it 's not funny now . maybe we both grew up .
it 's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt . it 's not anymore .
something that brings warmth to my heart . duckbill platypus .
i think you 're right . is there anything i can do to make it up to you ?
i 'm not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you 're irreversibly screwed up . but , maggie , you 've been like this since we were kids . and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people 's feelings , maybe it 's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own , like bob , if he 's the one .
peggy , there 's distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up . despite that , i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory , and i beg your forgiveness .
no . you 're quirky . quirky and weird are two different things .
but i 'm weird .
no . i 'm weird . weird and mysterious are two different things .
but you have n't lost your mystery ! you 're very mysterious !
no , i do n't think you 're like , `` i 'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do n't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you '' . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery .
because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' .
why ?
i 'm going to kill myself .
on anything male that moves ? as opposed to anything male that does n't move ?
i know . i think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves .
yes .
thank you . do you think i flirt with cory ?
good morning to you , too . you look good .
he looks better with that stuff out of his hair . he 's an attractive man .
over there . ten o'clock . he 's talking to our little dennis . dennis will turn into one of those `` sources say '' things .
where ?
there he is . snoop doggy-dogg .
not that he does n't deserve to get fired ... look ! cory 's going for second ! ... sneaky !
ya think ?
it 's probably because you got him fired .
that 's what he says , but if he thinks that i do n't realize he 's writing another article , then he 's an idiot .
for what reason ? some personal satisfaction ?
okay , he 's on base . can we talk about my life now ? -- ike 's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that i was never serious about gill , blah blah . he 's totally out to get me .
she 's the boss .
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they 're getting haircut .
yup !
reporter ?
stop it . when you talk like that , i get turned on and it frightens me .
i did n't even need to change this gasket , just put in a little hydraulic fluid .
you 're a goddess !
yes , i 've seen it . and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me !
so -- mag -- you 've seen this , huh ?
no , it 's humiliating and you 've been doing it since i was a kid . i do n't like it . stop . you may not like having a daughter with problems . but guess what ? i do n't like having a father who 's drunk all the time . i 'll eat in my room .
a harmless joke .
no . it 's my life .
maggie , it 's just a joke ...
just stop it . do n't say another word like that .
what ?
thank you , dad .
i 'm really rooting for this one .
i changed it . see you later , mr. travis . that guy has a problem ... maggie , you can run everyone 's life but your own .
his name is skipper , dad ... steady .
good boy , port hole .
i 'm not exactly having fun , either ... steady .
not this one . this one 's on me .
so i 've come to see it as a bonus , really , that we 've been able to plan , and pay for , so many weddings .
maybe she has n't read the paper ...
yeah .
you know , it 's just possible that she has n't read this yet .
no .
no , no . you 're her best friend .
no , you tell her .
you tell maggie .
`` and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance . so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride is n't honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race ... before the rice hits the ground '' holy moly .
`` what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them . she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar. '' ... i ca n't ready anymore .
so you 're angry . big deal .
you turn it on , you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time .
what am i going to do with a microwave ?
you take the microwave ?
that 's good .
how about ... you 're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way .
nope .
you do n't love me , is that it ?
nope .
is there somebody else ?
there 's no why , annie . i 'm just not up for it . i never said i was .
no , that 's free . he 's an architect . used to do big high-profile projects . he scaled it all back when his wife died . now he remodels people 's homes . he works in a small firm , makes a good living .
i hope i do n't have to pay for that piece of information .
it 's on the lake right in the middle of seattle . it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
but it 's on the water .
it 's not a boat boat . it 's really a house .
boats . all anyone talks about is the wind . is it up , is it down . i ca n't live with a man who only talks about the wind .
houseboats do n't go anywhere .
boats . you go out in them . you come back in them . i hate them .
it sounds nice .
i hate boats .
he 's got a houseboat .
tell me he 's living in squalor . tell me everything he has is being repossessed , including his filthy , dented mobile home .
look !
what ?
oh !
yes . some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony .
you okay ?
i think that 's what i 'm saying .
oh , walter . i do n't deserve you .
not really . look , annie , i love you . let 's leave that out of it . i do n't want to be someone you 're settling for . i do n't want to be someone anyone settles for . i have a life insurance policy , i 'm fully invested in growth stocks , i have a paid subscription to home rox office , i have no sexual diseases , i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that is n't soft , i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth , i dress nicely , i am a member of the private sector , an independent voter , i do n't watch monday night football , the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat , strawberries , penicillin , pollen , nuts and wool . there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring . if you do n't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it , is n't it ?
i 'm not at the top of the empire state building . i 'm here .
at the top of the empire state building --
i told you . nothing --
so what happened ?
yes . but it was n't really . it was just ...
-- it was a betrayal .
i do n't know what to say about it , walter . it was a form of temporary insanity . but i had to tell you about it because --
walter , there 's something i have to tell you --
beautiful view , is n't it ?
it 's so beautiful . it 's just what i would have picked out if i 'd had every ring in the world to choose from . you see what i mean . there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises , but i am not one of them . surprises are highly overrated .
it was my mother 's .
walter .
it 's just like my grandmother 's china .
i do .
you could n't .
do n't hate me but i love this pattern .
well , i did . and you know what i think ? i think that it was almost ... too perfect .
no .
about forever .
what ?
i am . i was just ... i just got ... i think i got nervous . it 's normal , right ? do n't you ever feel nervous about , you know ?
ever since christmas , you 've been different . kind of distracted , distant . but i feel like you 're coming back from wherever you were .
you go .
okay , okay .
and then i 'll see you in new york --
when you get back , i 'll be gone --
not for the kind of place i want to do . i wo n't be in chicago that long .
could n't you just do a phone interview ?
i know . it makes no sense at all . thank god my life is in place .
that does n't make any sense .
becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was rick , which meant he was cheating on her . she was completely hysterical . then it turned out the woman lived in duluth .
i got ta go . i 'll see you at work . walter , you scared me . do n't ever do that again .
miss scarlett . in the broom closet . with the radio .
oh , it 's just becky , she 's having trouble with rich again . hold on , becky , i 'm going downstairs .
who is it ?
i do n't think so .
does it have wheat in it ?
it 's delicious , trust me .
what is it ?
we will ? the symphony ? okay . i 'll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni .
go to the symphony --
go for a walk in central park --
we 'll stay at the plaza --
walter , i 'd love to --
i was thinking , i have to go up to boston for the aap convention and then visit winston-hughes about switching over our computers . why do n't we meet in new york for valentine 's day weekend ?
happy new year .
happy new year , darling .
do n't be silly . i 'll just be ten minutes behind you .
i 'll wait .
how will i get back to baltimore saturday ? oh god , i forgot my present for your stepmother -- i took it inside by accident .
you sure you do n't want to drive with me ?
nope . not even when i was young .
even when you were young ?
nope .
i love you , walter . did anyone ever call you anything other than walter ?
i love you .
they loved you . i told you they would love you and they did .
today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth .
is that all right with you ?
my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead .
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
he 's allergic to everything , do n't worry about it --
do n't touch them . i feel terrible sneezing at a time like this . this is a big moment for me --
they 're going to love you .
am i what they had in mind ?
i hope he does n't get out his slides .
your uncle milton lost all his money in a puerto rican condominium that went belly up , do n't mention the irs or the federal prison system . your mother is barbara , your father is cliff --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
and your brother tom is a psychology professor and is married to ... betsy --
-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he did n't --
harold , who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- who 's married to --
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene --
i hate it . i 'm so happy , becky . finally i feel happy . this is right . this is real . everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts . please do n't tell anyone about what happened . `` sleepless in seattle '' is history .
i love the symphony .
we 're going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night .
what are your plans in new york ?
no , i 'm not .
you 're going to miss the train .
it does n't mean anything . it was written before i went out there . before the ho .
what about the letter ?
i 'm going to run back to walter 's arms , if he 's still have me .
so he ca n't write . big deal . i mean , verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy , and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble .
made for each other .
m.f.e.o . ?
`` dear annie : thanks for your letter . it was great . we 're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine 's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o . sleepless in seattle . ''
so i mailed your letter .
becky ?
well , it 's the same woman . and he was crazy about her . what is this ? this is from seattle .
this is a photo of hair .
i saw her . she looked just like this --
you do n't know who she was , annie --
it 's a sign i 've watched this movie too many times . i 'm so stupid . from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio , i 've been a complete jerk .
it 's a sign --
he said hello .
but he saw you , right ?
that was nothing compared to this humiliation , nothing .
i love that dream .
you know that dream where you 're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you ?
you were standing in the middle of the street ?
good night .
i love you , too .
thank you . i love you .
no . that 's the weirdest part about it .
is this crazy ?
what ?
becky ?
okay . good . goodbye .
that 's not what i mean . i 'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him . i am .
you told a lie and got on a plane .
i could n't do it . how did i get here ?
did you talk to him ?
definitely .
you 'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it .
i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows .
the kid is on . you 've got me listening to this garbage . go on , turn it on .
what ?
turn on your radio !
hello .
i always wondered about that too .
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ?
i know .
men never get this movie .
listen to this , i love this part --
plus he fell in love with a temp .
and then you left him ? he lost weight there and you left him ?
yes .
no .
can too .
that 's impossible . a guy ca n't --
he lost all the weight ... there .
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet .
you want to hear about destiny ? if my husband had n't gone on a diet , which caused me to leave him , i would never have been on that flight to miami , and met rick , and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says `` vacant-occupied , vacant- occupied , vacant-occupied '' --
good . perfect . i 'll be in new york with walter , i can squeeze it in .
`` on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentine 's day . ''
`` i want to meet you ... ''
your destiny can be your doom . look at me and rick .
i do n't know . i mean , what if i never meet him ? what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him ?
what ?
i should say something in this about magic .
right .
i 'm going to marry walter . i just have to get this out of my system .
you are . you 're losing your mind . what about walter ?
i know that . you think i do n't know that ? `` i know that 's a dumb way to begin , but it 's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i 'm just losing my mind . ''
and this woman is a writer ! that 's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers .
`` i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows '' --
it sounds like the name of a mattress store --
`` dear sleepless and son ... ''
... movie . that 's your problem . you do n't want to be in love . you want to be in love in a movie . read it to me .
they knew it . time , distance , nothing could separate them . because they knew . it was right . it was real . it was ...
you 're a basket case .
not .
oh ? oh , really ? now we 're getting down to it .
actually , he sounded nice .
and now 2,000 women want his number . the guy could be a crackhead , a psychopath , a flasher , a junkie , a transvestite , a chain-saw murderer , or someone really sick , like rick .
that 's what she called him on the show . because he ca n't sleep .
`` sleepless in seattle '' ?
nothing 's with me .
what 's with you ?
what was what ?
what was that about up there ?
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
it 's not true , but it feels true .
whatever it is .
about what ?
you should write something about this .
you want a tail . i got a guy in seattle --
no . not remotely . i just want to find out about him .
oh . like glenn close in that movie .
i 'll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him .
a sense of humor .
no , no , no , it 's more like , who is he , does he have a sense of humor , is he nice -- no forget nice , i 've got nice --
so you want a financial , is he a deadbeat , we can do a d & b --
no , i know that part --
do you want a matrimonial , past wives , any kids --
she has a pattern of getting involved with losers ... once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus .
okay .
i need to know about him because ... he 's involved with my sister ...
that 's what i 'm going to do . i 'm going to go home . i quit . laurie , i quit . i 'm going back to baltimore . how does a blonde do a high- five ?
go home for the weekend .
i want my money .
maybe you should see a shrink .
i know .
he was n't even wrong for you , like < u > cosmically < /u > wrong , so do n't beat up on yourself for wasting ... however long it was .
i know .
honey , he was n't right for you .
howard .
howard .
hi , jonah . sam . and who is this ?
i 'm jonah . that 's my dad . his name is sam .
yes .
are you annie ?
come on , jonah --
oh god , it 's major . he 's kissing her on the lips . i have to stop this .
how am i going to explain this to walter ?
this is a complete disaster . i wanted him to find a wife , but he 's got the wrong one --
this is a grotesque violation of this man 's personal life , but never mind --
please --
and you crazy ? he thinks shows like this are dumb . if you did n't have an 800 number i could never get away with this --
perfect . sandbag the father .
any time .
thank you , tom . i feel so much better just having blown this off .
yes , i did .
i know , i know . i do not want to move to seattle . but what i really do n't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something . what do you think ? it 's just cold feet , is n't it ? everyone panics before they get married , did n't you ?
it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
i do n't even know him . but i 'm having all these fantasies about a man i 've never met , who lives in seattle .
annie , when you meet someone and you 're attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
i got married because betsy said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .
i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
what ?
i think i 'm going crazy , tom . i really do . are you happily married ?
you do n't believe in signs .
it 's a sign .
so you 'll get married in a new dress .
like ... clockwork .
well , fine , fine . fiddle da dee . and how 's it working ?
mom , we already ...
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department , so do n't be worried if it takes a while --
mom !
i knew we would be together forever , and that everything would be wonderful , just the way you feel about walter . walter . it 's quite a formal name , is n't it ? one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack i believe you call it --
magic .
magic . it was magic .
what ?
you know .
what ?
i was in atlantic city with my family . cliff was a waiter . he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier . i 've probably told you this a million times , but i do n't care . and then he held my hand . i was scared . all sorts of thing were going through my head . but after a while i forgot about them . at one point i looked down , at our hands , and i could n't tell which fingers were mine and which were his . and i knew .
it was n't a sign . it was a coincidence .
then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread ? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna ?
oh , please . destiny 's just something we 've invented because we ca n't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental .
destiny takes a hand .
it is , is n't it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life .
how amazing .
it 's silly , really . i mean , i 'd seen him at the office , obviously i 'd seen him , he 's the associate publisher , and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place , and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat , which of course he was allergic to , and i got his lettuce and tomato on white .
how did it happen ?
you 'll love them . we 're going down to d.c. tonight to be with them christmas morning .
are his folks nice ?
i know . he 's wonderful , is n't he ?
i notice these things are back in fashion . oh , honey . he 's a lovely man , annie .
granny 's dress . oh , mom .
the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them --
we 'll move them --
it 's probably just the flowers --
walter and i are engaged !
everybody ! annie has an announcement --
the one in the street . i chased after you .
it 's me ?
it 's you .
shhhh --
hi . so far so good . so . what should we talk about ? how insecure we were in high school . shirley votypka , the first girl i ever felt up . health . what about health ? did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak ?
hi .
hello .
hello .
magic .
magic .
you touch her for the first time , and suddenly ... you 're home . it 's almost like ...
sure you do --
sure you do .
thanks , but i 'll pass . it 's kind of a big night . i do n't like to leave jonah alone .
sam , if you 're not doing anything new year 's -- obviously you 're not doing anything new year 's -- we 're having some people over , all of them married , not one even remotely interested in playing around . does that sound great or what ? i ca n't think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened .
why me ? what about jay ?
the point is , take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we wo n't have to redo the kitchen cabinets .
grace the dispatcher . great .
grace heard it .
great . this is great . the whole town knows . just out of curiosity , how do you two know ?
the cabinets have to be redone --
which means --
and if i could describe it , it probably would n't be on a radio show . but what the hell . it 's not one specific thing . it 's more of a feeling .
why not ?
i do n't think i could really describe it .
what was it that made you know ?
i do n't know . when i met my wife , it was so clear . i just < u > knew < /u > .
what are you going to do , sam ?
it 's hard to imagine .
do you think there 's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife ? maybe even more ?
what 's she talking about ?
we 've been talking to -- well , let 's just call him sleepless in seattle , and we 'll be right back after this break with listener response , < u > your < /u > response , to the things we 've been discussing . the number to call is ...
and i do n't want to invade your privacy --
look , doctor , i do n't want to be rude , but --
why not ?
no .
have you had any relationship since ?
it 's been about a year and a half .
good . how long ago did your wife die ?
all righ ...
i think it 's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better .
i 'm not mad at you . okay , i 'm not mad at you .
jesus , are we on the air ? jonah , for god 's sake --
dr. marcia fieldstone of network america .
who is this ?
i 'm not selling anything . your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife .
i 'm probably not interested in whatever you 're selling .
hello , sam , this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america .
hello .
tell her how you do n't sleep at night .
i have no doubt that you 're a good dad . you can tell a lot from a person 's voice . but something must be missing if jonah feels that you 're still under a cloud .
fair enough .
okay , but if i get yelled at , i 'm never gon na listen to this show again .
i 'm sure he wo n't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him .
i do n't know --
well , i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly .
yeah .
is he home right now ?
you want me to talk to him ?
it 's very hard for him to talk about this stuff . it 's like it makes him sadder .
why not ?
no .
i 'm worried about him , he 's worried about me , i ride my bike to school , he follows in the car , like i 'm not supposed to know he 's there . now it 's christmas , and you know what happens to people at christmas .
and you 're worried about him .
i 've been pretty sad , but i think my dad is worse .
i 'm sorry to hear that , jonah .
she died .
where 's your mom ?
he does n't have one now . that 's the problem .
you do n't like the one he was now ?
it 's not for me . it 's for my dad . i think he needs a new wife .
got me there . what 's your christmas wish , jonah ?
it 's not that late in seattle .
no last names , jonah . hello there , you sound younger than our usual callers . how come you 're up so late ?
right , right .
it is not --
it is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
no .
how about rapacious and love- starved ?
just because someone 's looking for a nice guy does n't make them desperate .
what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio ?
they met at the empire state building , only they did n't . never mind .
this is going to be tougher than i thought .
you 'll like it .
some woman is going to want me to do it to her and i 'm not going to know what it is .
you 'll see .
what is it ?
you 'll find out .
what 's tira misu ?
great . they 'll have a parade in your honor . you 'll be man of the year in seattle magazine . tira misu .
i do n't think it could let a woman pay for dinner .
well . things are different . first , you have to be friends . you have to like each other . then you neck . this can go on for years . then you have tests . then you get to do it with a condom . the good news is , split the check .
seventy ... eight .
when 's the latest time you were out there ?
everywhere . you ca n't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy 's butt was cute . who the first babe to say this was i do n't know , but it caught on .
you mean , like , `` he has the cutest butt '' ? where did i hear that recently ?
and that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . what women are looking over , okay ? pecs and a cute butt .
i 'm not asking you to set me up , jay . that 's not what i need your help for . i want to know what it 's like over there .
sandy has a girlfriend , clenda ... she 's a weightlifter , but it 's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
well , okay . what 's the big deal ? if she 'll forget the new fireplace , i 'll marry her . just point me in the right direction .
hey , my plate is full .
i 'd rather die than eat on an airplane . i 'm telling them you 're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they wo n't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything .
i do n't know . do i ?
do you want a fruit plate ?
window .
do you want an aisle or a window seat ?
but how am i going to get there ?
i have forty-two . so that would definitely cover taxicabs , i think .
eighty dollars .
nobody knows . it changes practically every day . how much money do you have ?
do you know how much it costs to go to new york ?
you have to go to her , jonah . you have to find her .
i do n't get it .
this is the best movie i 've ever seen in my life .
your only hope .
yeah . what 's that ?
it 's y. o. h .
you think so ?
write her .
h and g. hi and goodbye .
dad , could you close the door ?
sure .
what do you mean , okay ? would n't you like a dog ?
okay .
maybe we 'll get a dog when we get back .
it was all they had .
i ca n't believe you flew first class .
no .
i mean , so far , have i screwed it up for you ?
no .
listen , have i ever done anything really stupid ?
if i did n't go .
when i found you ?
i was scared of what you were gon na do .
what if i could n't get to you ?
goddammit , i am sick of this --
no .
get out .
i 'm not leaving this room until you say yes .
i ca n't know what i said , but we 're not going .
did too .
did not .
you said we could go to new york .
this conversation is finished .
shut up ? shut up ? ? ? mom never did that . mom never said shut up to me . mom never yelled at me .
shut up .
what 's wrong with annie ?
thank you , jonah . but the point is , i am not asking permission .
fine . i wo n't say anything . you can marry count dracula .
this is the one i like .
i have to have a life . i have to do things that i want with people my own age . it 's none of your business who i am going out with . i do n't give a good goddam if you 're angry --
yes .
are you going with her ?
i 'm only going to be away one night , okay , and clarise will be here . you 'll have a swell time . you 'll watch a little geraldo , some nightmare on elm street 12 , i 'll never know .
it might be in the kitchen .
have you seen my wallet ?
i sincerely hope you are not going to marry jessica .
the reason i know this and you do n't is that i 'm younger and purer so i 'm more in touch with cosmic forces .
the one who wrote us .
who is annie ?
dad , i was talking to jessica about reincarnation , and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life .
victoria ? she 's okay .
god , she 's beautiful .
i 'm never going to meet anyone who 's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes ? what do you think ? there 's a perfect woman walking around out there ?
was mom an adjustment ?
jonah , this is n't fair . you do n't know victoria . i hardly know her myself . she is , in fact , a mystery to me . she tosses her hair a lot . why does she do this ? i have no idea . is it a twitch ? does she need a haircut ? should she use barrette so it does n't keep falling in her face ? these are things that i 'm willing to get to the bottom of , and that is why i am dating her . that is all i am doing . i am not marrying her . can you appreciate the difference ? that 's what single people do , they try people on and they see if they fit . but nobody fits perfectly , everyone is an adjustment .
if she knew , she 'd never forgive me . it would be hopeless for the two of you .
this is not a joke . thank god victoria does n't know . it would really have hurt her feelings .
it 's a short word .
long enough to call victoria a ho .
i just called for a second .
everyone at work heard you .
no .
did you call that radio station again ?
that 's true . why is that ?
the water tastes better in the kitchen .
there 's a bathroom upstairs .
i was thirsty .
what are you doing up ?
i thought i saw a black widow spider .
do n't ever do that again .
i 'm glad you liked it . good night , jonah .
thanks for dinner . i never saw anybody cook potatoes that way .
thank victoria for dinner .
okay .
jonah !
it 's only ten o'clock .
okay , tiger . time for bed .
she 's going to cook something for us ?
why is she bringing that bag ?
there she is .
i figure we could go to new york , catch the knicks , and since we 'd be there anyway , obviously we 'd go to the empire state building --
perfect . we 'll be there .
she does n't want us to go to baltimore . she wants to meet us in new york city on valentine 's day . on top of the empire state building .
here is seattle . and here is baltimore . case closed .
oh , right .
it 's a sign .
everyone thinks brooks robinson is the greatest .
dad !
wait ! ! ! -- `` and while we 're on the subject , let 's just say right now that brooks robinson was the best third baseman ever . it 's important that you agree with me on that because i 'm from baltimore . '' dad , she thinks brooks robinson is the greatest .
jonah , i 'm leaving --
just this one part , okay ? `` i have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as i or anyone else can remember , and i guarantee you will not get one past me ''
not now , jonah --
listen to this --
now i 'm late . bye .
her name is annie . annie reed .
the heels on these shoes are very large . why have i never noticed this ? the heels on these shoes are grotesque .
this is a good letter , dad .
i look stupid . i look stupid , do n't i ? i look like i 'm trying too hard . i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i 'd look like i just got a haircut .
great .
sleepless and son . baltimore .
this one 's for both of us .
good .
i ... uh ... have a date with someone friday night .
i know . but she 's here , jonah . because i have you . and as long as i have you , i have your mom .
i 'm starting to forget her .
i never did . or the whole idea of an afterlife . but i do n't know any more . i have these dreams about ... your mom ... and we have long talks about ... about you , and how you are , which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway . so what is that ? it 's sort of an afterlife , is n't it ?
like do you believe in heaven ?
i do n't know .
i miss her . what do you think happens to someone after they die ?
is that what she used to sing ?
bye bye blackbird .
you 're worried we 're going to be all right . we 're going to be all right . i remember sometimes you 'd have nightmares as a baby . your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song .
our house . there was water coming in all the windows .
what was ?
it was sinking .
how do you know ?
i know .
dad , this is amazing . if you play this backwards , it says `` paul is dead . ''
it 's nice to meet you , jessica .
hi , dad . dad , this is jessica .
go to sleep .
jed 's got cables .
whose show was this on ?
in the movies women are always scratching up guy 's back and screaming and stuff . when they 're having sex .
what ?
will she scratch up your back ?
what do you think ?
if you get a new wife , i guess you 'll have sex with her , huh ?
i 'm starting to notice that .
it does n't . they ask you .
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you 're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it 's just a drink , if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you do n't you can go home if you see what i mean . i wonder if it still works this way .
-- a slice of pizza --
you see someone you like , you get a feeling about them , you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
english muffin . how do you do it ?
this is not how you do it . you want this on an english muffin or a bun ?
dad , you 're not taking this seriously .
she looks like my third grade teacher . i hated my third grade teacher . hold it ! wait a minute ! she < u > is < /u > my third grade teacher !
she 's willing to fly anywhere .
i 'm not going to think about what they 're not teaching you in school . i am not going to think about it . generally speaking i think we should rule out people who do n't live somewhere near here --
somewhere in the middle .
oklahoma . do you know where that is ?
this is no good . she 's looking for someone french . or greek . `` dear sleepless in seattle : i live in tulsa . '' where is that ? --
thank god . something you do n't know . it 's a single white female .
`` dear sleepless in seattle : i am an swf '' -- what is that ?
you have to give them your phone number or they wo n't let you go on the air .
how did they get our phone number ?
they called and asked for it . `` dear sleepless in seattle . you are the most attractive man i 've ever laid ears on . ''
just out of curiosity , how did they get our address ?
right . i 'm sorry , jonah , i 'm sorry .
stressed .
i 'm sorry . i 'm just --
i think i know how to have a spice rack .
should n't you have used a toggle bolt ?
sure . looking good .
so i can go .
fine . fine .
jed is having a slumber party new year 's eve and he invited me .
just out of curiosity , do you have any friends whose names do n't begin with a j ? i feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you jonah . what is marjoram ? does anyone know ?
i forgot to mention . jed called --
what ?
p. dad ?
does red pepper go under r or p ?
dad --
what 's the matter with this one ? would n't you like to have imelda marcos as your mother ?
no , i 'm not , but --
oh , you 're changing your mind --
dad , i do n't know about this one --
you 're right . you better hope so .
nobody else is going to know it was us .
what ? !
it plays in 50 states .
how many people do you think heard that thing last night ?
my feelings exactly .
not .
right .
it 's never happening again . right ?
dad ? about last night ?
we desperately need a spice rack . desperately .
it 's a spice rack .
the hopes are perfect -- beautiful , identical , smooth -- and they are for something really amazing i feel it in my bones --
i do n't think i have to now .
i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .
there 's somebody on the phone for you . his name is sam .
what is it ?
dad --
i think they 're announcing your flight .
well ...
sure . i 'd really like that . thank you so much .
we ought to start camping again , dad .
i went camping once . i love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed .
do you like it ?
what about it ?
what about camping ?
yes , i do . in fact , my firm has box seats for the mariners . why do n't we all go next week ?
do you like baseball ?
hi . he should book now because we can get an excursion fare . jessica 's parents are travel agents and --
hi , sam . and let me guess -- you must be jonah .
well , here 's the number . if you ever find yourself sleepless , give us a call . we also ... do babysitting .
thanks , but ... we 've got plans .
we live two piers over , do n't we ? number 12 , right ? we 're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by .
you must be jonah .
yes ?
hi . sam ?
hi .
look , i met somebody . she 's good , and capable and smart . we hit it off . we ca n't spend your life chasing after fantasies .
would you follow < u > her < /u > through an airport ?
anyway , victoria 's nice .
`` an affair to remember . '' did you ever see it ? cary grant and deborah kerr . before that it was called `` love affair with irene dunne and charles boyer . ''
what do you mean ?
it 's a little derivative .
now that i 'm seeing someone , it 's a whole other thing .
you 're kidding --
it 'll take him a while to come around . a month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them i needed a wife --
how 's jonah taking it ?
i tried to talk to her ... it was like i knew her . weird .
you saw her in the airport and then here ?
he 's over at the boat show . he 'll be by later . it 's so beautiful here .
god , it 's wonderful to see you . where 's greg ?
i 'm sorry --
move on . right . that 's what i 'm going to do . in a few months , boom , i 'll be fine , i 'll just grow a new heart .
eventually , in a few months , you 'll start seeing women , you 'll meet someone .
microwave . five minutes .
five minutes in the microwave . any one of them , five minutes and done . ready to eat . do you know how to make juice ?
sure . sure .
absolutely . when i come back , maybe the two of us should spend some time together , on our own . what do you think ?
it takes time --
i read the same article ...
i read an article about this ...
he 's good at it .
he 's ten .
absolutely . right .
no . after he was born , every time we started to make love , he would cry . he had an uncanny sense of timing . we really should n't do anything here anyway .
is he there ?
i 've already solved it . i 've hired a hit man .
i know her pretty well . maybe i could call her --
we ca n't finish the job . she 's on her sixth painter , now she 's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
so whatdya say ? i 'll get the check , and i 'll call you in eight months .
oh .
you < u > are < /u > the first woman i 'm going out with .
no way . no way i was going to be the first woman you went out with after ... there is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after ...
you could have called me --
i really wanted you to call me , and i thought you were never going to --
you did ?
i thought you were never going to call me .
you look good yourself .
you look good .
hi .
hi .
there 's nothing stopping you .
are you going to let us pass -- or do i have to call the sheriff ?
no . my name is quintero . mister quintero .
i mean it . i know your work record . you were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that ? you had a real future with this company , but you let those reds stir you up . and now they 'll sell you down the river . why do n't you wake up , ray ? that 's your name , is n't it , ray ?
that 's none of their affair .
the men would like to know who this gentleman is .
no thanks .
you 're welcome to one .
naturally . you think i parked here for a cup of coffee ?
want to go up to your office , mr. alexander ?
your foreman says that 's a foreman 's job .
why did n't you give a warning signal ?
i told you it would happen . it 's bound to happen when a man works alone !
i do n't make policy .
got any more ideas ?
no , just the ring leaders . the fire-eaters . and the ones with big families ... barton -- where 's that boy ?
you want 'em all arrested ?
you have n't tried locking them up !
i 've tried everything but shootin ' 'em down .
well ?
now do n't get excited , mr. alexander . they 'll scatter like a covey of quail .
whose side are you on anyway ?
not so sure about that . letter of the law , you know . all the injunction says is no picketing by miners .
well , those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning , but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail .
how 's it going ?
mornin ' .
you know ... what 's good for the goose is good for the gander .
what do you mean -- sex equality ?
he says give 'em equality . equality in jobs , equality in the home . also sex equality .
so ? what does he want to do about 'em ?
question , question -- the problem , what to do about 'em .
the woman question ?
it 's like charley vidal says -- there 's two kinds of slavery , wage slavery and domestic slavery . the woman question , he calls it .
yeah .
three hours ! just to heat enough water to wash this stuff ! i tell you something . if this strike is ever settled -- which i doubt -- i do n't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us . it should 've been a union demand from the beginning .
it never ends .
how goes it ?
you ca n't send him back to oklahoma . it 'd be inhumane .
jenkins ai n't no boss . mean we 're gon na let people like jenkins stay here ?
no , no , it 's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make jenkins general manager . so why you acting so mean ?
it 's the paymaster from moscow -- with our gold .
now why do n't you let these gentlemen pass ? do n't you know who 's in that car ?
i say we got ta take action . now .
take a drink . calm down !
you 're a liar , pancho . a no-good , dirty ...
you were n't even there . you were back at the station . kalinsky told me ...
i checked the drift just before he blasted . it was all clear ... the man must have been asleep or something .
an american .
who ? a scab ?
you work alone , savvy ? you ca n't handle the job , i 'll find someone who can .
foreman wants to get the ore out . miner wants to get his brothers out . in one piece .
he will if he wants us to go on blasting .
now wait a minute . super 's the one made the rule . he ai n't gon na give you no helper .
so much the better .
super 's busy -- with your negotiatin ' committee .
you know the beef . this new rule of yours , that we work alone . we 're taking it up with the super .
hear you had a little trouble , quintero . defective fuse ? well , you 're all in one piece . so what 's the beef ?
yes . we will light the candles .
can we light the candles now ? on the cake ?
they are singing for me .
why are they singing , mama ?
hush ... not a word about the cake , hear ?
mama , can i put the candles ...
later . when i finish the ironing .
are you sad ? are we going to church ? for your confession ?
no , estellita .
are you sick , mama ?
with ramn it 's ... pride . i spoke out of the bitterness in me . and he was hurt .
so they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away .
good . come in , we 'll work it out . sit down , sit down .
it 's all set . consuelo 's squad can take they day off tomorrow . we 're taking over .
do n't you worry . we 'll get some action .
he ca n't drink this milk . it 'll make him sick . he 's on a formula . i was a fool ! i should n't have kept him with me .
no . no . i ca n't . if ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
come on , esperanza -- how about it ? we got to .
sure . where they 're negotiating . in the company office . we 'll go up there and picket the place .
to the mine ?
this means they 've given up trying to break the picket line . now we can all fight together -- all of us .
what are you saying ?
this is what we 've been waiting for .
and if you ca n't understand this you 're a fool -- because you ca n't win this strike without me ! you ca n't win anything without me !
will you be still ?
whose neck shall i stand on , to make me feel superior ? and what will i get out of it ? i do n't want anything lower than i am . i 'm low enough already . i want to rise . and push everything up with me as i go ...
shut up , you 're talking crazy .
yes . i talk of dignity . the anglo bosses look down on you , and you hate them for it . `` stay in your place , you dirty mexican '' -- that 's what they tell you . but why must you say to me , `` stay in your place . '' do you feel better having someone lower than you ?
you talk of dignity ? after what you 've been doing ?
no , you do n't . have you learned nothing from this strike ? why are you afraid to have me at your side ? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
charley 's my friend . i need friends . why are you afraid to have me as your friend ?
charley vidal says ! do n't throw charley vidal up to me !
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ...
like what ?
ramn were not getting weaker . we 're stronger than ever before . they 're getting weaker . they thought they could break our picket line . and they failed . and now they ca n't win unless they pull off something big , and pull it off fast .
who said anything about giving up ? i 'll never go back to the company on my knees . never .
you mean you 're ready to give up ?
aah ! they 've got other mines . you do n't see the larger picture . they 've got millions . millions . they can outlast us , and they know it .
it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine .
and you know why ? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two , three months . what 's it to them if the mine 's shut down a little longer ?
whose funeral ? we 're doing all right . there has n't been a scab near the picket line for three days .
sure , the standby squad . stand-by for the funeral .
but you are needed . especially now -- with most of the other men away . you 're captain of the stand-by squad .
why not ? i 'm not needed here .
ramn -- you ca n't .
no .
alone ?
sun up .
when ?
hunting .
where are you going ?
no . we ca n't ca n't go on this way . we ca n't go back to the old way either .
we ca n't go on this way . i just ca n't go on living with you . not this way .
tell me .
but you wanted to talk . tell me .
be still ...
that meeting only lasted ten minutes . the first night i 'm home , and you run to the beer parlor . what is it ? ca n't you bear the sight of me ?
you were n't waiting for me .
i waited up till midnight .
yes . to plan for the picket line tomorrow .
a meeting ?
all right , but later . i 've got a meeting now .
we 've got to have a talk , you and me .
no , no ... the sheriff had enough of us . we drove him crazy .
but if you go back they 'll lock you up again .
no , no ... we would n't do it .
did you have to sign a pledge ? not to go back to the line ?
we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in .
four nights . how did you sleep ?
i 'm okay . but it 's nice to be home .
how do you feel ?
okay . then , tomorrow , i take the kids with me to the picket line .
i 'm telling you . i do n't stay home with these kids tomorrow .
i 've had them since the day they were born .
you might get hurt . listen , if you think i 'm gon na play nursemaid from now on , you 're crazy ... i 've had these kids all day !
i 'm going back tomorrow .
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime , huh ?
yes .
must 've been some experience for you , huh ?
sure .
you all right ?
backward .
can be what ?
anglo husbands can also be backward .
there 's jenkins ' wife . you do n't see her on no picket line .
no , she wants to be there . and there 's mrs. kalinsky .
she 's the organizer 's , wife . she 's got to be there .
yes , i do . there 's ruth barnes .
the union do n't run my house . those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you do n't see any of them down there .
but the motion passed . it 's ... it 's not democratic of you to ...
no .
it 's not fair ... i should be there with them . after all , i 'm the one who got the women the vote .
ca n't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time ?
but it 's yours . i wo n't let them ...
i do n't want your dead body . i do n't want you back in jail either .
over my dead body .
let them take it !
because if we lose , we lose more than a strike . we lose the union . and the men know this . and if we win , we win more than a few demands . we win ... ... something bigger . hope . hope for our kids . juanito ca n't grow strong on milk alone .
what makes you so sure ?
not just juanito . you 'll have it good too , esperanza . we 're going to win this strike .
i 'd lie on my cot in the cell and i could n't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat . and i 'd say to myself , think of something nice . something beautiful . and then i 'd think of you . and my heart would pound against the cot for love of you .
you are no good to me -- in jail .
they say i am no good to you .
what were they saying ? about you ? in there ?
he 'll have it good . some day .
drink , drink , juanito . you 'll never have it so good .
he was born fighting . and born hungry .
a fighter , huh ?
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
mother of god ... have mercy ...
it 's nothing . just a little catch ...
what 's the matter ?
i did forget . lus told me .
forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me .
antonio paid for it .
was it expensive , the beer ?
no , no ...
i 'm a fool .
i did not mean to weep again . why should i weep for joy ?
aaah , what 's the use ?
never ... never ... never !
stop it ! the children are watching . stop it !
if i think of myself it 's because you never think of me . never . never . never ...
is that all you care about ? that radio ? ca n't you think of anything except yourself ?
all right . have your strike . i 'll have my baby . but no hospital will take me , because i 'll be a striker 's wife . the store will cut off our credit , and the kids will go hungry . and we 'll get behind on the payments again , and then they 'll come and take away the radio ...
esperanza , have you forgotten what it was like before the union came ? when estella was a baby , and we could n't even afford a doctor when she got sick ? it was for our families ! we met in graveyards to build that union !
what has it got me , your union ?
now do n't start talking against the union again .
i see . the men . you 'll strike , maybe , for your demands -- but what the wives want , that comes later , always later .
first we got to get equality on the job . then we 'll work on these other things . leave it to the men .
the safety of the men -- that 's more important ! five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up . you 're a woman , you do n't know what it 's like up there .
what 's more important than sanitation ?
we ca n't get everything at once . right now we 've got more important demands .
what ?
we did . it got lost in the shuffle .
do you think i like living this way ? what do you want of me ? !
forget it ? i chop wood for the stove five times a day . every time i remember . i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes . and bathrooms . inside .
forget it .
i 'm sorry . the fire 's gone out .
this water 's cold again .
got to talk to the brothers .
where you going ?
i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor .
but you had to have it , did n't you ? it was so nice to listen
it is n't right , she says . was it right that we bought this ... this instrument ?
we 're only one payment behind . i argued with her . it is n't right .
me , i 'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- montana , colorado , idaho . but did he ever think to organize the women ? no . wives do n't count in the anglo locals either .
aw , cut it out , ruth .
look who 's talking ! the great white father , and world 's champion of women 's rights .
we ca n't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies . and we 've got to treat them as such .
or why do n't you just put a sign outside ? `` no dogs or women allowed ! ''
but honey ...
why did n't you support her ? you 're the worst of the lot .
maybe not . but there 's another thing ... like when you came in tonight -- i heard you ask your wife , `` who 's that ? his grandfather ? ''
you know i do n't think that .
well , you 're the organizer . you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you 're dead right . but when you figure everything the rank-and-file 's to do down to the last detail , you do n't give us anything to think about . you afraid we 're too lazy to take initiative ?
go on . spill it .
yeah . lots of provocation lately . they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge , maybe they can bust the strike .
hear those deputies slugged 'cente .
okay , so discrimination hurts the anglo too , but it hurts me more . and i 've had enough of it !
exactly . and equality 's the one thing the bosses ca n't afford . the biggest club they have over the anglo locals is , `` well -- at least you get more than the mexicans . ''
because most of us here are mexican- americans ! because we want equality with anglo miners -- the same pay , the same conditions .
then why 's the company hanging tough ? they 've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one ?
do n't horse me . price of zinc 's never been higher . they do n't want no strike -- not with their war boom on .
are we talking to a union spokesman ?
it 's possible . just negotiate .
well , if that 's possible ...
too bad . the men 've always wanted to get a look at the president . but you 've come out here to settle the strike ?
no ...
new york ? you 're not the company president by any chance ?
no . new york .
you mean delaware ?
that 's all right -- it 's no secret . my name 's hartwell . i 'm from the company 's eastern office .
you should have helped her without being asked .
but you 've got me doing everything . mama never used to make me dry the ...
you 've got to help around the house !
but papa -- you need all the help you can get .
do n't i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school ?
the junior shop stewards . there 's lots of ways we can help .
the what !
papa , ca n't i leave now ? there 's a meeting of the junior shop stewards ...
i do n't want you hanging around there , hear ?
boy ! did you see the way mama whopped that deputy with her shoe ? knocked the gun right out ...
she 's coming . charley vidal gave her a lift .
where 's your mama ?
papa ! we seen 'em ! two scabs ! over there !
lus ! come down here !
it 's mama 's saint 's day .
forgot what ?
i thought maybe you forgot ...
what are you doing here ? something wrong with mama ?
you think i was going to work you over ? i would n't dirty my hands with you ...
i know , it 's wrong . just let me go . i 'll leave town ... just let me go .
you think my kids have enough to eat , you rat ?
my kids do n't have enough to eat !
t ! traidor a tu gente ! rompehuelga ! desgraciado !
ramn -- listen my kids ...
you judas ... blood-sucker ...
ramn ... listen to me ... i 'm in a jam ... i had to get a job ...
you ... you ... i 'd expect it of an anglo , yes ... but you ...
ramn ... listen for the love of god ...
maybe . i think he 's got a few things to learn about our people .
sure . but you want the truth ? you 're even suspicious of him .
he 's a guest in my house , is n't he ?
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses .
what attitude ?
and another thing . your attitude toward anglos . if you 're gon na be a leader ...
do the bosses wait ? no sanitation . so my kids get sick . does the company doctor wait ? twenty bucks . so we miss one payment on the radio i bought for my wife . does the company store wait ? `` pay -- or we take it away . '' why they in such a hurry , the bosses ' store ? they 're trying to scare us , that 's why -- to make us afraid to move . to hang on to what we got -- and like it ! well , i do n't like it i 'm not scared ... and i 'm fed up -- to here !
but you do n't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union . you wait till you 're ready , so you can win .
i was talking to my wife .
no , i do n't mind . that 's how come i told you about it .
you mind ?
yeah ? first door on the right . it ai n't that dirty . just kinda ' filthy is all .
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road ?
good . i fucking hate australians .
no .
are you australian ?
that 's it ?
what you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom . it 'll take you right to the highway .
bobby , bobby , bobby . rhymes with ...
fuck man . come on , bobby .
come on . ease off the girl .
what ?

what is it ?
no , why ?
did you see his hair color ?

i guess i do n't have a hell of a lot of choice .
i 'll have to live with that . my money my risk , my rules .
now that 's down-right insulting .
because i do n't know him and i do n't really know you , partner .
why ? the guys is ready to deal now .
i wan na do a small buy first . ten thousand . we 'll see how it goes .
it 's downright classy is what it is .
first rate , ai n't it ?

you 're good , princess . i 'll give you that .
do n't worry about it . just go across the street and watch . you 'll know when it 's safe to go back .
why ?
will you do that ? then i want you to get out of the room .
i do n't want to .
never mind . just do what i say . he holds out the baggie . colette backs away .
what is it ?
i want to do this for you . i want to do something good for a change .
really , i do n't want to .
nothing could be worse then this slow death i 'm living now .
they would have killed you too .
no , you 're wrong , i tried to tell myself the same thing but i could have gotten up . i could have done something .
i ca n't tell you .

i 'm kind of busy .
it 's me .
who is it ?
no . but i 'm the only one with my sad story . and that 's how it 's gon na stay .
you think you 're the only one down here with a sad story ?
therapy session is over .
what are you hiding , danny ?
you do n't like the tune , find another station .
there you go again . you 're nothing but false notes .
who the fuck are you ? dr. joyce brothers ?
you 've got a comeback for everything , do n't you , danny ? you use 'em like some sort of shield .
how much time do you have ?
what is wrong with you ?

yes . why do you find that so hard to believe ?
so you 're just attracted to me , is that it ?

turns out i 'm allergic to steel-toed boots . go figure . by the way , i 'm not looking for a matching set . where 's quincey ?
what happened to your eye ?
oh . hi .
how ?
then make sure he gets put away for longer .
i ca n't . i 've got a kid . she lives with my parents . quincey knows where they live .
that 's long enough to get out of town .
why ? they do n't hold him for more than a day or two .
why do n't you call the cops ?
because he 'll kill me .
then why do n't you leave ? just give me one good reason .
fuck you .
you get off on abuse or something ?
i ca n't leave .
there 's nothing to understand . the guy is a pig .
you do n't understand .
why not ?
i ca n't .
then leave .
who the fuck are you , dr. joyce brothers ? i hate the son-of-a-bitch .
do n't tell me , down deep he 's really not a bad person and you do n't want to see him get hurt .
it 's not that easy .
look , it 's really none of my business but why do n't you just dump this guy ?
go ahead .
nothing .
what ?
colette ...
oh , he 's a keeper all right .
this man sounds like a real catch .
do n't worry , he 's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now .
ouch .
could be worse . oh sorry , forgot who i was talking to .
that bad , huh ?
leave me out of this .
what about the guy on the very bottom ?
i do n't know ... . you could be staking your financial future on stealing bob hope 's stool specimen .

come on , cheer up . it could be worse .
oh god .
i was thinking alice cooper .
jesus , i look like a raccoon .
i understand . thanks anyway .
look ... i 'd like to help you out ... but i really do n't want to get involved .
can you do me a favor ? this girl i know , her boyfriend 's a real piece of shit-dude 's really jamming her up . i promised her i 'd try to help .
what ?
oh shit
hey , you did the right thing . you would n't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself . they have eaten your ass alive .
i 'm fine . little nervous ... little disappointed that i did n't finish this myself .
how you holding up ?
these guys are smart . i knew they would n't hit a deal unless they knew all the players . i needed a big buyer .
that 's when he called me . he told me his story and he pitched me a plan .
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for , i 'd have to set up a deal so sweet , they would n't be able to walk away from it .
how ?
it 's not too late to show her you 're sorry .
i do n't buy that . there 's a place for hatred . did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed ? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her . do you know what that feels like ?
your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker .
i 'm genuinely happy that you found some peace , nancy . but you ca n't forgive for liz . no one can . and you ca n't forgive for me .
i know it 's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
maybe i am dealing with it .
you 've got to deal with this sooner or later , tom . you ca n't keep hiding .
is that what you want me to do ? put it all on jesus ? let him sort it out in the afterlife ?
i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter . i gave my grief to jesus christ .
closure ? how do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there ?
billy sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in gardena a few weeks ago . said you looked so bad , he barely recognized you .
all right , nancy , how 'd you track me down ?
it 's tom .
who is it ?
you 're a good man . jimmy the finn .
would n't be a favor if you were paying me . i 'll just take my five when the deal is done .
good for you jimmy .
nah ... i want to keep it . maybe i can use it for like , inspiration ... you know ... like when i detox ?
i 'm sorry . i could n't .
i do n't know ... a little . i wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning .
because i do n't want to see you end up like kujo and those other losers . i thought that maybe if you knew that i did n't use , you might see it in yourself to go clear .
wait if you do n't trust me , why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs ?
and you want me to do you some big favor ?
i do n't trust anybody .
you do n't trust me ?
i ca n't tell you .
but ... why ? why would you pretend ?
are you kidding me ? a bunch of amped -out tweakers ? it was easy .
no one ever noticed ?
you ever notice how i always showed up , in the middle of a binge ? left before it was over ? how i sneak away for cap-naps ? how when the crank came around to me , i always said i 'd just done one ?
this is n't like that queen elizabeth question , is it ?
when ? when did you ever see me use ?
but ... i 've seen you .
i 'm not a tweaker . i do n't use drugs . i never had .
what ?
it 's you ! i did n't have a picture or nothin ' so i had to describe you to the guy . not bad though , huh ?
what the hell is that ?
hey , check it out ...
jimmy , look , there 's something i have to tell you .
you 're my best friend , man . i 'd do anything for you .
why ?
it do n't matter . i 'll do it . and you sure as hell do n't have to pay me .
wait till i tell you what it is .
okay
you are n't coming with me .
but why ? you only owe me five . and that 's not till after we close the deal tonight .
tem thousand dollars . everything i could spare . it 's for you .
what 's this ?
thanks for not laughing at me .
yes , jimmy .
danny ?
yes , jimmy
was he the president ?
john fitzgerald kennedy .
what does j.f.k . stand for ?
sure , jimmy .
can i ask you something ?
no . i 'm good .
you want a hit ?
no you think she 's a tweaker ?
you ever see queen elizabeth sleep ?
you 're going to have to give me a little more than that , jimmy .
he does n't have one .
you 're going to have to explain that one .
i think on account of his nose .
why do they call him pooh-bear ?
palmdale
yeah , that 's what i mean . where the hell does this guy live anyway ?
you mean , like to throw 'em off ?
you know , jimmy , you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over .
personal protection . it 's a dangerous world we live in , jimmy , a very dangerous world .
hey , why do you need a gun and a vest anyway ?
not tonight .
you wan na score some go-fast ?
the del ammo mall mostly .
jimmy , where do you find these people ?
10 % . that 's ...
i 'm getting a 10 % finder 's fee from my man if i can get the right price .
sure .
can you set that up ?
i think so . i mean , we 'd have to talk to him .
can your man handle that ?
fuuuuuck
a quarter of a million , jimmy .
a quarter ? danny that ai n't even worth ...
i know a buyer . guy 's looking for a quarter 's worth .
yeah , pooh-bear . dude is a big-time cook . i 'm talking dire .
you remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up ?
i find myself in dire need of some cash .
do n't get carried away .
you . you 're smooth . you use words like dire and shit . you got language skills , man .
what ?
see that ? that 's just what i 'm talking about .
business . i need to leave town and i find myself in dire need of some cash .
so , why 'd you want to see me ?
i guess there 's just no substitute for good genes .
i 'm serious , dude . you always seem to be on top of things , even when you 're tweakin ' .
that 's a good one .
you 're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine . here . have a beer .
why does it have to feel so bad ?
sorry .
was . i 'm on the fucking ghost train right now , man . you got anything for me ?
you on a roll ?
i 'm hurting .
oh ... that . ah , he was just juiced . he would n't have did nothin '
nice dealer you got there , jimmy .
well , jimmy the finn , let 's go score some gack .
finland is a country .
you do n't say .
my features . they 're finnish .
why 's that ?
jimmy . everyone calls me jimmy the finn .
i had n't noticed . i 've seen you around . what 's your name ?
nice day
lead the way .
i know a guy .
where to ?
midnight ?
twelve
what time is it ?
guess it 's our turn .
how the hell did we get this detail ?
understand what ?
you do n't understand .
you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose . or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter ?
what does that mean ?
by not disgracing her memory !
you never did like me much , did you verne ? and you ca n't stand it that i walked out of there alive and liz did n't . you think i 'm a coward , do n't you ?
that was my idea .
then why do n't i see any pictures of me up there ?
yeah , dickhead .
cool it . we got business .
what the fuck are you gon na do about it , dickhead ?
this is bullshit . you did n't say anything about anybody else being here .
just some buddies .
what the hell is this ?
i 'll keep that in mind .
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they did n't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel ?
no one . it was just a test . i need to be sure of who i 'm dealing with from time-to-time .
what the hell was that ? who told you i was five-0 ?
do n't do that . please . or i 'll kill you . please , danny .
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now .
yeah .
can i pull my fucking dick out ? !
i did n't fucking do anything ! i swear to god !
now get talkin '
okay ! okay !
shoot him .
uh-uh-uh ...
please .. i do n't know what you 're ...
do n't address me . i did n't make the accusation .
what ? !
captain steubing thinks you might work for the police .
big bill
pooh-bear . come on , man . what is this ? it 's me , danny . i thought we had a deal .
big bill .
come on , guys ...
pull your motherfucking pants down .
i 'm sorry ?
pull your pants down .
you want to do this some other time ?
hey , i do n't play that .
i want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal .
hey , i was just trying to ...
i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman .
why do you say that ?
maybe you 're the one who is n't taking me seriously .
pooh-bear , i do n't mean to be rude , but i get the feeling you are n't taking me seriously .
if you say so .
so that 's 40 lbs . at 6 a pound then ?
but you 're a friend of jimmy 's . i think of you as a brother already .
but i just met you .
anything for a dear friend .
you 're serious ?
hey , okay .
okay ... how about um .. 6,000 a ounce .
i deal in u.s. pounds , friend . none of that faggot metric crap for me .
i do n't know , 14,000 a kilo ?
make me an offer .
can we talk price ?
secret recipe .
not bad .
i insist . it 's delicious . just a taste .
no , i 'm good .
i 'm sorry . would you like a taste ?
the good stuff . can you handle that ?
crank or glass ?
yeah , i uh , have a buyer who 's looking for about a quarter 's worth .
no shit ? fuck it . i 'll send it to oliver stone then . he 'll get them to reopen the bastard .
um , i think the warren commission has been closed for a while .
i 'm gon na get this developed and send it to the warren commission .
answer the fucking question !
please ... do n't do this ...
yeah . okay . listen carefully ... you 're in the bathroom . you 've been shot in the shoulder ...
whatever you say , man . look ... can we talk about this ?
my name is tom .
danny ?
yeah .
i thought you 'd be happy .
jesus .
took a pig-slicker to the heart .
pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant .
murder . beautiful .
we got the 411 on your good old boy .
that 's real sweet , garcetti . thanks .
who is it ?
i 'm afraid so , danny .
what ? is it bad ?
that 's probably what he would have done if we had n't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme .
what 's to stop him from just ripping me off then ?
guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers . as least that 's what the word is .
whata you mean ? he told me -
that 's because he does n't have one .
you think you 're so god damned smart , do n't you ?
news-flash , tanner . i 'm a fucking rat .
bullshit . he 's a liar .
no . you just handed us a new one . we can go federal on your ass right now : ongoing criminal conspiracy . intent to buy and distribute $ 250,000 worth of crank . what 's the mandatory on that , al ?
for that old possession charge ? gim me a break .
well , if you 'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
whata you mean i 've got no choice ?
you 've got no choice .
look man , i just wanted to make some dough and disappear . i did n't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him .
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off ?
standard vig . minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn , who 's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory .
what 're your taking down ?
after that ass-whipping you gave me ?
you better not be blowing smoke up my ass , flynne .
bubba .
this chink have a name ?
i met the guy at a party . he said he wanted to do a biggie . he 's new in town so i offered my services .
i ca n't help it , tanner , you hit like a fucking girl .
you think this is funny motherfucker ?
okay , asshole , you wan na play , we 'll play .
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here ?
cut the shit , flynne .
i was trying to score some dope .
question is , what are you doing here ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
soon . i promise . we 'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear . in the mean time , trust me , he has no idea that you ratted him out .
when ?
look , we 'll talk to the a.d.a .
danny , he is n't gon na find out it 's you . domingo was a slinger , he must have sold to hundreds of different people .
if he finds out it 's me , i 'm a dead man .
tell me what ?
i was getting to it .
bobby laid his own tracks . he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end . and as far as i 'm concerned , he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him . now take the money .
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid .
just the way the world works . look , as far as tweakers go , you are n't a bad guy . you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know .
you do n't find that repugnant ?
the money ? the drugs ? keeping yourself out of jail ? i know the drill .
do n't you wonder why i do it ?
it 's not my place .
thanks for not judging me .
garcetti thinks everything is shit . he does n't even like dolphins .
garcetti thinks i 'm a pile of shit .
hard to compare the people you 're taking down with the lord .
you think i 'm a judas ?
do n't be . i 'm worried about the kid .
danny , i 'm touched .
somebody has to help you lazy bastards .
god damn , flynne , you are one observant tweaker .
yeah . pretty sure . oh yeah ... he had a spear gun , too .
it was all pretty informal . did n't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries .
no last name ?
never mind . dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts .
what ?
bobby , rhymes with hobby .
you got a name ?
well , you know what they say , just because you 're paranoid , does n't mean everyone 's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat .
feeling the paranoia tonight , are we ?
if it 's all the same to you , i 'd rather not dish right here in the middle of crankville .
you go , boy .
i 've got a hot one .
with you clowns watching my back ? what do you think ?
nervous ?
did n't you hear ? domingo 's dead .
you know , i 'm starting to think i 'd rather take my chances with domingo than go through any more of this shit .
i 'm making the small buy tonight ... if i do n't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something . if everyone is happy , we 'll do the big deal later in the week .
when is the deal going down ?
worse . much worse . a teacher .
come on ! who is it ? domingo 's boys ?
you mean the menacing red car ?
speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me ?
what if he caps me before you can make a move ?
we 're coordinating with palmdale p.d.. we 'll have your sorry ass covered .
funny , i do n't feel lucky .
you 're lucky , flynne .
they have . but they never found a lab .
why does n't palmdale p.d . just raid the guy ?
several possession charges , but nothing major .
excuse me ?
no . you 've got me all wrong . i mean , in you own pussified way , you actually got some nuts in your little sack .
lay off , garcetti . i 'm not in the mood .
who 'd have thought it ? danny `` chickenshit '' flynne trying to go large right under our noses .
hell , yes ! what the hell do you expect zapping mr. johnson with that crackler ?
what 'd you do , piss your pants ?
that would be me .
what 's that smell ?
oh they 're all that and the proverbial bag of chips .
sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens , flynne .
now that i can help you with . nasty boy ... goes by the name of pooh-bear . he 's a chef . check with palmdale p.d . i 'm sure they 're keeping box scores on the guy .
what 's on the other end of this thing ?
and he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one . you know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker , flynne . might just as well broadcast it on the evening news .
he 's the only one i told .
who the hell is jimmy ?
jimmy ?
i still do n't know what you 're talking about .
we know what 's going on .
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time ?
fuck you , garcetti . i been at this for almost a year . i 've done everything you guys have asked of me .
and he 's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was .
what ? !
he knows somebody ratted him .
and what does this have to do with me ?
the mexicali boys
to who ?
turns out he 's connected .
yeah . what about him ?
danny , it 's really pains me to have to tell you this , but do you remember domingo , that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back ?
garcetti , you 're teeth , they 're fucking perfect .
i 'll tell you why you did n't help - because you 're a chickenshit tweaking snitch . you 're a bottom feader , flynne .
hey , you want me to do all your work for you , numbnuts ?
then why did n't you help the kid when you were there ?
what 's he holding ?
dude is bugging . transparent spiders , plastic men - the whole nine yards .
cut to the fucking chase , flynne .
that 's him . he 's a lot prettier in person though .
it speaks !
this the guy ?
why are you doing this ?
my sentiments exactly .
that is so unfair .
but that 's okay , liz , you 're the one with the steady job , you pay all the bills . i 'm just an unemployed musician . you have every right .
here it comes , poor tom .
no . you know what gets old ? being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up .
quit feeling sorry for yourself , tom . it gets old .
we all know how much you like hearing that . okay , liz , i was wrong . there . you happy ?
just admit you 're wrong .
just no pleasing you , is there ?
i wanted you to ask back there . you know , before you got us lost .
first you want me to ask for directions , then you do n't . which is it ?
look at that place . it 's creepy .
what do you mean ?
you think that 's a good idea ?
okay , okay . there 's a house up there . i 'll go ask for directions .
tom , quit fucking around .
hey , do you think you could eat me if you had to ? and if so , which part do you think you would find the most delicious ?
you mean like the donner party ?
come on , where 's your pioneer spirit ?
why did n't you just ask for directions back there ?
no . right here on the beach . come on . let 's do it .
there 's no motels around here .
tom , let 's spend the night here .
it 's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch .
really ?
and you 've got wiener breath .
you , madam , are a heartless wench .
i was talking about miles .
again , i thank you .
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it .
thank you . thank you very much .
a virtuoso rendition . tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of miles davis ' haunting , moody piece .
maybe he is n't showing .
where 's bubba ?
yeah , i 'd hate to shoot you by accident .
just make sure you hit the floor when we come in . it could get ugly in there .
good work , flynne . you 're a first-rate rat .
we 're in business .
now that 's scary !
she 's 57 and she 's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years .
do n't we always take good care of you ?
golly , i had n't thought of that .
that 's not good in prison . it 's just not good .
and believe me , word will get out that you 're a pro rat .
yeah . this could be the one we 're looking for .
you thinking what i 'm thinking ?
i thought you were done .
jesus jimmy , you at the alpha team .
no , you ca n't taste it . it 's the fucking lab ! now shut up .
i just want to be straight on the details . can i taste it ?
do n't worry about it .
what is that ? rum and coke ?
better than drugs .
what is it , drugs ?
danny , listen up . here 's the deal ... my wife 's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab . they 're getting a very special delivery a week from this friday .
thank you , sir .
good luck , john .
the numbers do n't make sense , sir . his brothers are dead , that 's too bad , but they 're out of the equation . sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away . one private is simply not worth a squad . colonel anderson this one is . he 's worth a lot more than that . which is why i 'm sending you , you 're the best field officer there is .
alright , i 'll give you that . continue .
respectfully , sir , sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private does n't make a fucking , goddamned bit of sense . sir .
spit it out , captain .
but , sir ... i ... i ...
he 's the last of four brothers , the other three were killed in action . this is straight from the chief of staff .
a private , sir ?
there 's a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred-and- first near ramelle . i want you to take a squad up there . if he 's alive , bring him back to the beach for debarkation . take whoever you need , you 've got your pick of the company .
sir ?
i 'm sending simpson to take over for you , the division is going to caen , you 're not coming with us , i have something else for you .
pinned down , a mile east of here , waiting for some help from the navy guns .
where are your men now ?
yes , sir .
it was a hard assignment , that 's why you got it .
they did n't want to give up those one-fifty-fives , sir .
fourty-four , twenty one dead .
casualties ?
a company , wehrmacht , no artillery , we took twenty-three prisoners , turned them over to intelligence .
resistance ?
sector four is secured , we put out the last three german one-fifty-fives , found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc .
report .
... alright , let me know when .
find a chaplain .
shit , that was no big deal .
did you see what he did , back there ? he stepped right into the open , so i could get across .
you take account of the wind ?
forty-two-hundred , i figure .
that must be four thousand yards .
not where i come from .
you must be a hell a shot .
yep .
the army gave you that ?
thirty-ought-six , norton long-barrel with dual-groove , parallel rifling , elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer .
what about the captain ? where 's he from ?
we got us a tent , forty-two feet across , eighteen feet at center , hundred-and-ten foldin ' chairs . circuit 's eleven towns , covers all 'a hasset county and most 'a weller county . i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin ' said ministry .
so they travel around from place to place and preach ?
i do n't make jokes about things of , or related to , the preaching of the holy gospel , including the ministerial calling of my family .
no kidding .
in the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch hudson with a big ole ' trailer .
in west fork ?
i 'm jackson . i 'm from west fork , tennessee . my pappy 's a preacher . him and his two brothers got a ministry , the blessed church of the wandering gospel .
figured .
as a matter of fact , i am .
you writin ' a book or somethin ' ?
so , where are you from ?
i am , but i like imported whiskey . so there i am and i hear the biggest ole ' coon you ever did hear , 'a rustlin ' right there in front of me . that ole ' boy comes right out of the brush , i got a clear shot and he knows he 's 'bout to meet his maker . i aim , i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole ' coon , go on , now , you get out 'a here . then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a ' that mash whiskey .
jackson , how many times i got to tell you , you 're from tennessee .
me ? i 'm walking with my hound , lucy , it 's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we 're out huntin ' coon . i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey ...
what deal ?
no kiddin ' ?
like hell , you did .
well , i 'll be goddamned , i knew it .
nope , he ai n't wade .
he ai n't wade .
i guess .
he ai n't half-bad , i guess .
i mean , ryan , what do you think of him ?
i think i 'm we got that eighty-eight .
what do you think ?
hell , no !
reiben , are you makin ' fun 'a the way i talk ?
y'all come back .
of course , sir .
yes , sir .
cap'n ... ?
he 's right , we ca n't shoot him ... well , we could but we 'd get in an enormous amount of trouble . and he 's right about the bridge , it 's a hell of a lot more important than he is .
looks like a flaming asshole to me .
so , that 's ryan .
yep , you step on a rusty nail , get lockjaw , never say another word as long as you live .
you know what the best possible thing that could happen is ?
the hell he did n't .
just shut up , ryan did n't kill wade .
you shut up , this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of . goddamned ryan , fuck the little bastard .
shut up , will you ?
fuck private james ryan , fuck him , just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch .
wade , sarge , corporal insect , all of us , hell , i 'll bet even the captain has a mother .
last i knew .
they got squirrels there , too , right ?
reiben , how many time i got to tell you , i 'm from tennessee .
you know what a b.a.r . weighs ? nineteen and a half pounds , not counting ammo . and you think these things are comfortable ? they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each , that 's thirty-six pounds , right there .
army life is too dang easy , my feet have gone soft . back home , we go out squirrel huntin ' , i walk forever and a day and then some , do n't even raise a blister .
if we find ryan and he 's still alive , that son-of-a-bitch is gon na carry this goddamned b.a.r . back to the beach for me .
hell , no . i think he 's the best officer in the whole goddamned army , bar none .
you got somethin ' against the cap'n ?
no one 's gon na win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian . they assembled him at o.c.s . out of spare body parts from dead g.i. 's . i know this for a fact .
hell , no , last time i shot a corporal , cap'n miller near bit my head off .
jackson ?
to each , his own .
it 's worth it .
do n't that get kind of expensive , cap'n ?
you see , i 've got the best house in all of addley . it 's not the biggest house , but it 's got the best location , right next to the junior high baseball field . the garage windows face left field . the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them . the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens . two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows . it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far . i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up , the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship . i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass , i know we 're one step closer to winning it all .
say what , cap'n ?
i 'm in my backyard , lying in my hammock , with my arm around my wife , listening for the sound of breaking glass .
keep trying .
not yet .
good , now get your goddamned gear .
sir , i understand . i do n't like it , but i understand .
you 'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve . there is no wade , there was one , but he died a long time ago , he 's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name , you understand ?
sir , i understand what you 're doin ' , but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner .
who 's wade ?
sir , i ai n't feeling so chipper on account of wade .
what the hell 's the matter with you , jackson ?
gives wade the second shot .
watching .
they do n't send planes to put out machine guns . two flank runners with surpressing fire . i 'm going right , whoever goes left has to be fast .
we left them eighty-eights .
my guess , too .
in the shadow by those two trees .
where ?
wade ?
yes , sir . it seems to me , sir , that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only , and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop , smack-dab in the middle of berlin , germany . now i ai n't one to question decisions made up on high , sir , but it seems to me that saving one private , no matter how grievous the losses of his family , is a waste of my god-given talent .
reiben , i want you to listen closely to jackson . this is the way to gripe . jackson , continue .
seems to me , cap'n , this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources . miller go on .
i 'd love to hear it .
sir , i have an opinion on this matter .
i most likely would have , sir , had i been given the opportunity .
you did n't volunteer , jackson .
captain , my feet are most uncomfortable . if i 'd 'a known we was gon na have to walk all the way to ramelle , i never would 'a volunteered for this here mission .
no , three brothers of his were killed in action . command wants him out of there .
senator 's son ?
a paratrooper named ryan . he 's going home , if he 's alive .
that 's general gavin 's . his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it , i 'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger , i 'll get court marshaled . if you were to take it , they 'd shoot me .
how about that jeep ?
sorry , sir . division is using everything on wheels to get up to caen . how come you guys are n't going ?
a half-track , anything .
no white-walls , sir , there 's a war on . not there , you goddamned idiot , over there ! i ca n't help you , sir .
white-walls ?
sorry , sir , fresh out of trucks , how 'bout a '38 ford roadster , hard-top , red with black interior .
i changed my mind .
captain , what about our deal ?
i teach english at addley high school in addley , pennsylvania .
what 'd you say , captain ?
that 's better , but you 've still got a long way to go . talk to reiben , he 's a natural and works at it , he 'll give you some pointers .
goddamn it , sir ...
there you go again , that 's whining , that 's not okay .
but , sir ...
upham , you 've got to learn the difference between whining and griping . you ca n't just rely on natural ability , you 've got to study and practice .
the germans do .
sure , you got one ?
would they notice and eighty-eight ?
those are tigers , they have six-inch armor , they do n't even notice grenades .
what about our grenades ?
those guns are close .
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner .
you do n't count .
i 'd like to stay , too , captain .
same place we are .
i wonder where they 're going .
plenty .
that only leaves three .
what do they know ? i had nine , but i feel through the ice when i was seven , my brother pulled me out . then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily , it was a dud . i figure one on the beaches , one on the cliffs and two getting here .
the men said , nine .
do n't need it , i 'm a cat , i 've got five lives .
good luck , captain .
a machine gun .
what is it ?
thank him and tell him we 're sorry about his loss .
no , but he heard firing , just east , less that a kilometer .
did he see any sign of them ?
five nights ago , he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg . the leg got infected . last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor . the doctor refused to come and when he got back , this is what he found . the krauts must have shown up while he was gone .
i do n't expect to live that long .
if that 's the way you feel , why do n't we wait until it 's up to a thousand .
i 'll tell you what , if i 'm still alive when it hits five-hundred , i 'll let you know and we 'll split the money .
over three-hundred .
where are you from , captain ?
some .
you know classical music ?
it seemed appropriate .
i heard .
i 've been humming it .
yes . do you know sibelius ' fourth symphony , the normandy ?
it looks like a renoir .
you think the rest of us were ?
i was n't made for this .
sarge ?
pass .
upham ?
like i said , it was nothing . do n't bunch up .
but you could have gotten killed and i ...
it was nothing .
sir , i 'm sorry about what happened , i ...
dashes across the street .
on the other side of the street , crouches in a doorway with jackson . upham is a bit in shock , less from the nearness of the bullets than from what miller just did for him .
glad of it .
that 's not all . there were nine gunners on the eighty-eights , one had a broken heel on his boot , two had bratwurst for supper last night , one of them is named fritz , the other , hans , maybe , i do n't know , it 's hard to tell .
you can tell all that , just by the sound , sire ?
forward ! forward ! now reverse !
i know about bracketing . i read about it . the next one is going to land right on us .
yes , sir .
reiben , i do n't know what i 'd do without you . sarge , keep ryan close to you and alive .
out of the mouth of babes .
uh , oh .
we 're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else .
what are we going to do ?
well , if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo , we might stand a chance , but not against those tanks .
what do you think ?
yes , sir .
sarge , see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable .
but , that 's my personal brand of stupidity , i feel kind of proprietary about it , if you do it again , you 're busted .
you 're welcome , john .
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me .
i 'll do my best .
do n't let yourself get killed , if you do , they might make me give back the medal and then i wo n't be able to lip off to colonels anymore .
i know .
you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve , you 're the last one still alive .
just what i want to do .
no , but if i get any worse , you 'll have to relieve me .
you want me to take over ?
i think you 're right , keith .
john , i 've got to tell you , i think you 're about used up .
that 's the rub . i liked wade . who 's ryan ? if they 're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other , how do i choose ? look at my hand , there it goes again .
except this time , the mission is a man .
simple , numbers . every time you kill one of your men , you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two , three , ten , a hundred others . we lost , what , thirty-one on the cliffs ? i 'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns . that 's over three hundred men . maybe five hundred . a thousand . then thousand . any number you want . see ? it 's simple . it lets you always choose mission over men .
and how do you bluff yourself ?
not in so many words , but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men do n't have good morale , it 's not worth a damn . so if you 're scared or empty or half-a-step from a section eight , do you tell your men ? of course not . you bluff , you lie .
oh , yeah ?
it could be worse . you know the first thing they teach you at o.c.s. ? lie to your men .
no problem . a pair of deuces ? less ? so what ? i bluff . it used to tear me apart when i 'd get one of my men killed , but what was i supposed to do ? break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ? of course not , so i bluffed , and after a while , i started to fall for my own bluff . it was great , it made everything so much easier . sarge is that why your hand 's been shaking ?
and what about your own hand ?
she 's the best poker player you ever saw . my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt . finally , my mother gave him an ultimatum , either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night . he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down , she never lost . she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands . and he bluffs ? he had sixteen levels of bullshit . her eyes , the tone of her voice , her bets , her jokes , the way she sipped her coffee , she was a master . she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game . every saturday night , my father would lose two , three hundred bucks and she 'd win it all back and then some . and i 'd stand there , glued to her shoulder , from the time i was five years old , watching every hand , every move , studying how she did it . that 's why i 'm such a good officer , i can look at a man 's face and tell you exactly what he 's holding , and if it 's a shit hand , i know just what cards to deal him .
bits and pieces .
you know why i 'm such a good officer ? because of my mother . have i ever told you about her ?
yeah .
yeah , vecchio , i could n't remember his name , he was a good kid , remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze ?
vecchio .
what was the name of that kid at anzio , the one who got his face burned off ?
let 's just find someplace .
you alright ?
snatches the morphine from sarge . quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot . he 's done this before .
hesitates . then drops his sulfa . fumbles in his pack . finds the morphine .
more morphine , hurry up , come on , come on ...
shoves the needle into wade 's neck . thick vein . pumps the morphine straight to wade 's brain . motions impatiently to sarge .
about to pour his sulfa . sees the wound . stops . knows it 's fatal .
pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .
rolls to his feet . fire another burst . kills the last of the german riflemen . does n't pause . runs onto the field .
hold your fire !
how about you shut up and take your position ?
how about ... ?
how about you take your position ?
how about i go right , sir ?
yeah ? what rule of thumb is that ?
i 'll be alright .
you may have to find yourself a new line of work , this one does n't seem to agree with you anymore .
no . it comes and goes . it stops when i look at it .
is it getting worse ?
a couple of weeks . it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading .
it does n't take this .
makes you feel small , does n't it ?
yup , hell of a mission .
now you 're the one kidding yourself . hell of a mission .
i hope this boy ryan is worth it .
you never know .
you 're kidding yourself .
if we stayed , we could make a difference .
three for three .
command is n't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell are n't going to let them surrender .
nope .
they guys here are n't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up .
and what about you ?
they 're fine . as long as they can gripe , they 'll be alright .
you think they 'll be alright ?
good news ?
nope .
you got me . afraid of bad news ?
since when have things been normal ?
it 's not normal , not reading letters from home .
maybe .
you ever going to open those letters ? miller keeps his eyes on the maps .
tell that to private james ryan . we 've got our orders . let 's go .
he 's right , captain , it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys .
that 's not what we 're here for .
got it , sir . we gon na go take care of those eighty-eights ?
uh , captain ...
push !
uh , captain ...
yep , hell of a mission .
hell of a mission .
a fucking mess , two maybe three kraut divisions , no fronts , no lines , the drops were completely fouled up , we 've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place , trying to hang on . command says we hold st. mere , but north of that , it 's all krauts . even if ryan 's where he 's supposed to be , he 's more than likely dead .
somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the hundred-and-first 's radios the night before the drop , not one of them works . we 're going in blind .
we in radio contact with anybody up there ?
now we 've got a straight shot , due north , to ramelle , twenty-six miles , two villages between here and there , st. mere , then bernay . we 'll take the jeep as far as we can , then go on on foot .
i 've got a line on one .
you get a translator , captain ?
twenty minutes ago . miller damn , i 'll go see if i can find another one . you get reiben , jackson and wade , meet me at transport .
what about talbot ?
fresh out .
okay , wade . translators ?
beasley 's dead .
i want reiben on b.a.r ; jackson with his sniper rifle ; beasley , demolition .
simpson ? jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick !
simpson .
what about the company ?
some private up there lost three brothers , got a ticket home .
you ? leading a squad ?
i wish . you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission .
caen ?
do n't need to , the krauts go that covered .
you tryin ' to get yourself killed ?
worked , did n't it ?
i thought you were my mother .
captain , if your mother saw you do that , she 'd be very upset !
rolls his eyes , takes a breath . scrambles into the gap . the other five right behind .
go !
more tanks ... ryan lot 's of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation . they know that they are dead men . they settle into their positions , and prepare to fire and die .
goddamn it !
knows what that means . he hears the rumble of the tanks .
continues firing . cutting down the advancing germans .
fires a burst . more germans drop .
fires a burst . germans drops .
here they come .
hears the faint distant rumble of the tank . barely has time to react . sees :
that 's not where i am . miller no ? where are you ?
i wonder if his cabin is still available ?
i coach the baseball team , too .
what deal ?
get back to your positions !
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
opens up with the machine gun .
here they come !
cocks his thompson . settles down behind some sandbags .
see to it .
leave him to me , captain , i 'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us .
let 's hope , because we 're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here .
maybe caen .
you 're goddamned right , i give the order . vote ! jesus christ ! listen to me , you little pissant pieces of shit , i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes , is that clear ?
yes , sir , of course , sir , i was merely speaking hypothetically . if this was a voting situation , then the vote would have been unanimous . but of course , it 's not a voting situation , you 're the captain , and you give the orders , sir .
have it your way , captain .
you 're only allowed to shoot at germans , that 's one of the rules .
what if our guys open up , sir ?
i have no fucking idea . here we come . cover me .
on the bridge ! we 're coming in .
looks like they 've been having a hell of a party , here , captain .
looks like tea time , maybe they 're brits .
scans the germans with his binoculars .
that 's a mystery to me .
no , sir .
has anyone ever told you , you 're officer material ?
maybe . but what if he dies on the way back ? you see what i 'm saying , sir ? the best possible situation is , he 's dead , we find his body , more or less intact , we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach , or better yet , we head over to caen and catch up with division .
but we accomplish the mission .
neither do i , sir . c : and this is the worst one , we find ryan and he 's wounded . not only does he not carry my gear , we have to carry his gear . and him .
i do n't like that one .
b : ryan is dead . he 's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade , whose name i know you do n't want me to mention . there 's nothing to find . the biggest piece is the size of a pea . we wander around , looking for him until the germans pick us off , one after another .
except for the last part , that one 's not bad .
well , sir , consider the possibilities . a : ryan is alive . we have to take him back to the beach . knowing you , you do n't let him carry my gear , even though he really should , and we all get killed , trying to keep him alive .
why 's that ?
i 've given this a lot of thought , sir . the best thing that could happen is , we find ryan and he 's dead .
well now i 'm saying we 're moving out . get off your ass .
i thought you said we had an hour , sir ?
up . we 're moving out .
is silent . motionless . he gently closes wade 's eyes . his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags . he fumbles and drops it . sarge notices .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
we ca n't leave it here .
sir , i 've got an idea , let 's go around .
i 'll make a note of your suggestions but i 'll leave that last one to you , especially if he 's already dead .
yes , sir , as a final note , i 'd like to say , fuck our orders , fuck ramelle , fuck the cheese capital of france and while we 're at it , fuck private james ryan .
any further thoughts on the subject ?
but i am a captain . if i were not a captain , i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player , which i am , having learned at the side of my mother who is , by popular acclaim , the best poker player in ...
sir , if you were not a captain , i would compliment you , now , for being an excellent liar .
in addition , as i pointed out earlier , i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products , when we arrive there , to see if they live up to their excellent reputation . moreover , i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i 'm more than willing to lay down my life , and the lives of my men , especially you , reiben , to help relieve her suffering . the men thoroughly enjoy the performance .
i 'm sorry , sir , i apologize . but if you were n't a captain , or if i were a major , what would you say ?
reiben , what 's the matter with you ? i do n't gripe to you . i 'm a captain . there 's a chain of command . griping goes one way , up , only up , never down . you gripe to me , i gripe to my superior officers . up , get it ? i do n't gripe to you , i do n't gripe in front of you . how long you been in the army ?
you have orders , too .
well , maybe not the captain , but the rest of us have mothers .
easy for you to say , sir . fucking james ryan , i 'd like to wring his fucking neck .
reiben , there 's a fairly good chance you 're not going to die at all .
i 'd much rather die in caen than ramelle , sir . it 's a personal thing .
never mind , do n't worry , we 'll pick up this kid , high-tail it back to division , everything 'll work out fine .
huh ?
ours is not to reason why .
well , sir , in purely arithmetic terms , since when does six equal one ? what 's the sense in risking six guys to save one ?
sure , what do you want to know ?
captain , could you please explain the math of this mission to me ?
upham , are you sure you 've never been in combat ?
jesus christ , he 's a natural !
stands on the edge of the woods , almost in a trance .
general gavin is going to be very irritated at you , captain .
well , i , for one , like cheese .
i 'm listening , sir .
there 's always a bright side .
sir , you know what ramelle is famous for ? cheese . the rest of the company is going to caen and we 're going to the goddamned cheese capital of france . there is no bright side .
there 's to be a bright side , look for it .
i should be on my way to caen , sir . it 's like beethoven , the guy 's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf . go figure , i mean , who 'd he piss off ? and here i am , the beethoven of ladies foundation garments , one step away from caen , the center of the known lingerie universe and instead , i 'm going to ramelle to save some fucking private who 's probably already dead .
yeah , how so ?
captain , i got ta tell you , the irony of this mission is fucking killing me .
where are you planning on putting private ryan , sir ?
sure , reiben .
captain , can i ask you a question ?
but , sir ...
trust me , you 're the best .
no , i 'm not , kaback is , honest . or what about faulkner ? or that little guy with the glasses ?
sorry , i need a b.a.r . man , you 're the best .
please , sir , you ca n't take me to ramelle , i got ta go to caen , sir , please , i told you , they make caen lingerie there , it 's beautiful , it 's the best there is , it 's ... oh , please , sir ...
strides through the chaos , avoiding the passing vehicles . he sees his men and walks toward them . reiben hurries up to miller , pleading .
stay at it until you get fire control . keep 'em down , wait for the navy .
i do n't think so , captain .
oh , captain , they 'll always make lingerie , it 's one of the three basic needs of man -- food , shelter , silk teddies . miller dream on , private .
there 's a war on , good chance they 're not still making lingerie in caen .
lingerie is my life , sir . my mother 's got a shop in brooklyn , i grew up in it , from the time i could crawl , we carry caen lingerie , it 's the best there is , it 's all i been thinking about since the invasion .
reiben , how the hell do you know so much about lingerie ?
just picture some french number been spending all day , every day , making cream-colored , shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists , what the hell you think she wears at night ?
so , you ever heard of employee discounts ? my uncle sells shoes , gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line , got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen .
do n't worry , we 're the only rangers this side of the continent , we 've got to be first into caen .
sir , what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while we 're pinned down here ?
sure , meet me at the top , we 'll start the paperwork .
captain , can i put in for a transfer ?
sarge ? he was the best friend i ever had . lem me tell you about sarge ...
and sarge ?
jackson was from west fork , tennessee , he was going to be a preacher , his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson .
yeah ?
upham ? good kid , smart , he was writing a book .
upham and jackson , what were they like ?
yes , private .
races through the debris . trailed by bullets .
fires the eighty-eight .
looks at miller , sees him growing weak , starting to sway . he gently tries to move miller aside .
does n't move . he just stares at sarge 's body .
struggling with a pair of germans .
is jumped on by one . upham fires . kills the german .
yes , sir .
you set ? sarge nods .
i wo n't need to sir , it 's already here , behind the barricade so ...
do n't do that again .
no , private , i want you to stay here , keep your head down , do n't do anything brave or stupid .
i 'd like to go , sir .
alright , come with me .
yes , sir .
yeah , yeah . i want you right next to me , no matter where i go , you understand ?
thank you , sir .
i hear you sir , but i 'm not leaving .
the hell you are n't , you 're comin ' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way . you hear me , private ?
this bridge can not be held . the germans have two companies less than three miles from here . they have tanks .
sir , if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up , our guys are going to be sitting ducks .
private . i 'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed is n't going to help .
... for you to blow up , yeah , yeah , we heard that .
hell , i do n't mind this mission , sir , as long as there 's something up at ramelle for ...
we all have , he 's got nine lives , or he 's bulletproof , or some damn thing .
wade 's right , it 's some kind of scientific , magnetic thing , i ca n't explain it , but i 've seen it .
look at upham , you do n't hear him complaining .
you want unpleasant ? just wait , i can do much better than this .
reiben , you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes .
fine , you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear .
as i was saying , before i was so rudely interrupted , my grandfather got old , as grandfathers tend to do . he needed someone to take care of him . we move around all the time , going from one mine to another , so we had to put him in a home . nice enough place but kind of depressing . but not for granddad . he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship , going to tahiti , he had his own cabin , first class , with room service . it just so happened that the weather was always lousy , so he never bothered to go up on deck . happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died .
oh , christ , now we got ta listen to that grandfather thing again .
no , i just happen to take the captain 's advice and look at the bright side of things .
that 's because , as i have pointed out on numerous occasions , you are a happy idiot .
so what ? i 've got three satchel charges , six gammon grenades , a dozen- and-a-half pineapples , and all my regular gear . you do n't hear me complaining .
hey , i got a mother . jackson , you got a mother ?
jesus , reiben , think of the poor bastard 's mother .
captain , he 's fast !
damn fool . sir .
what are we likely to run into ?
i usually like surprises .
yeah ? so ?
lingerie .
frogs ?
i care . do n't you know what caen 's famous for , sarge ?
who cares ?
out of the frying pan , into the fucking latrine .
fertilizer , captain , i think we 're in a cranberry bog .
shit , sir .
what about you , captain ?
i do n't know , i kind of like wade 's idea about the cruise ship . i 've never been to tahiti .
freaked out . trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter . ca n't .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
on guard , glancing back . pissed off .
he 's fast , captain , i saw him .
sir , i ran the 220 in high school .
somebody must know where he 's from , what he did for a living .
we know .
but everybody 's heard of him , he won the congressional medal of honor , he saved a dozen men .
get lost .
so , where are you from ?
shit , that 's nothing , i ran twenty- two flat .
twenty-four-five .
how fast ?
who knows ? it worked .
you think he really believed it ?
it 's easy , it runs in my family , take my grandfather , for example ...
how do you do it ?
since i was nine years old . they got a lot of explosives around mines . me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw . damn , we had fun !
demolition , right ?
we have records . we have proof . i 'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this , but it 's going to get worse . now , if i were you , i would take that fellowship .
no , no he 's not .
because he 's guilty .
how can you , how can you say that ?
do n't let your father 's business infect your life .
you 're trying to get me to say something , that 's why you 're telling me all of this .
well , take a look around the house . is everything nice , but not too nice ? are there lots of , uh , rugs , pieces of art , stereo equipment , uh , furniture , a lot of things bought with cash ? does he give a lot of gifts ? do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range ?
what 's the profile ?
look , why do n't you check it out for yourself ? see if your father fits the profile .
pardon me ?
we believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings , phoney patients . we 've been investigating him for five years . we believe that when they die , he takes their money .
i 'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that i worked for my entire life . i do n't even care . i met this boy over the summer , and i , i ca n't see him because of this , i ca n't talk to him , i ca n't talk to my father about ... i wore these clothes , i thought , i thought that if i looked right and if i acted right then someone would talk to me . but i look awful and i feel awful , could you , could you please talk to me ? be a little decent .
taking care of people is n't a growth enterprise , mr sims . i hope you write that down in your report , i 'd like your bosses to read it .
why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise ?
that 's right .
hmmm . your income , mr court , has n't changed substantially in seventeen years .
what family ? we never heard from them . i sold her house for them , made them money .
the , uh , cynthia branson estate was worth how much ? because her family ...
and your former wife .
this evening is over .
mr court , be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates ...
just come down to my place of business , for god 's sake . i have people here .
so you refuse to answer my questions ?
speak with my lawyer .
understanding the following rights ...
jesus . what , i live in a palace , right ? i have guests here .
yeah , i do n't want it . um , thank you very much . you 're very kind .
you 're sure ?
keep it .
okay , thanks .
oh yeah , let me give you another card .
i 'm sorry , but they turned down your card .
listen , i do n't know your name , but what are you doing for lunch ?
thanks , i like yours too .
excellent .
i 'll take the whole set .
good for her .
yeah , she won a fellowship .
for going to school ?
no , i 'm not married . it 's for my daughter .
is it a gift for your wife ? are you getting a set together ?
hi .
i 'll be home soon .
lloyd , honey , just come home , okay ?
hello constance . it 's me , lloyd ... nothing , i 'm just driving around ... she broke up with me ... what do i do ? ca n't she come back ? how can i get her back ? ... i ca n't think , talk to me ... i fucked up ... i feel like crying ... she gave me a pen . i gave her my heart and she gave me a pen .
forget it , forget it , it 's mine , it 's mine !
no , no , do n't go in there .
i just washed this shirt , did n't i ?
i 'll be in my office .
he 's a mess !
you 're tough , j-man .
i still am .
yeah .
i was hilarious once , was n't i ?
look , i 'm really sorry that mom and dad made you take me in . really . if it 's such a big deal , i 'll go . but remember this , it used to be fun . it used to be warped , twisted and hilarious , and i mean that in the best possible way , i mean it as a compliment . i mean , i 'm sorry t-i-m left you . but i am not t-i-m .
gee , it 's easy .
jesus christ . i get in a good mood . how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood , and then be in a good mood ?
why ca n't you be his uncle and not his playmate ?
good thing there 's not a red line on you , j-man . yeah !
because it 's loud enough so the neighbors do n't complain , that 's how come i know .
how do you know how to draw the red line anyway ?
why do you eat that stuff ? there 's no food in your food . not too loud , the red line 's there for a reason .
hey , bad throat , huh j-man ?
i hope you understand .
it 's no problem . i called mom and dad in germany ; it 's like they were there .
i 'm sorry . sam had to do a new crown , we had [ ? ] , and jason had a sore throat . your big graduation , and no one was there .
hey , sis .
lloyd ?
if she wants me , she can come to me .
the world is full of guys . be a man . do n't be a guy .
i am .
no , you 're not a guy .
lloyd , you have to understand her family is being ripped apart . like you and she were ripped apart . like joe and i were ripped apart .
i draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls .
read it .
what does it say ?
i already did .
lloyd , send her flowers , write her a letter . something .
alright .
you 've got to do something special . you 've got to make a statement .
so , what 's your point ?
lloyd , listen to me . everything has changed . you 've had sex . no matter what you might think , nothing will ever be the same between you two . you might be sixty . you might be walking down the street , and you 'll talk to her about something , whatever . but what you 'll really be thinking is 'we had sex ' .
alright , alright , alright , calm down , alright , calm down . nothing 's different .
i admit nothing .
did you sleep with her ?
see you . bye . bye diane .
see you tomorrow .
yes .
hang in there , man .
you are such a great person lloyd . i 'm a good person , but you are a great person .
okay , i got it .
wait for me for when i get round to the front .
please ? corey alright . alright , okay , here .
that 's just so embarrassing .
please ?
c'mon lloyd .
c'mon , just do it .
lloyd .
do me a favor ; take a picture of me with her .
lloyd , give it up .
look at those eyes .
brains stay with brains . the bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques .
sounds great to me , i 'm going to call her , that 's what 's cool about her .
diane court does n't go out with guys like you . she 's a brain .
i 'm gon na call her .
then what 's love ?
going out as friends .
what 's a scam ?
that 's not even a scam .
yes i did- i sat across from her in a mall . we ate together . we ate , that 's eating , sharing an important physical event .
but you never had a first date .
the movies are a good second date , you know , as a date ?
that 's unlikely .
i dream about it .
`` dear diane , i 'll always be there for you , all the love in my heart , lloyd . '' i 've never gotten a letter like this , have you ?
i 've forgotten what i was going to say ... okay , okay , i remember . let him do what he wants .
what ? i 'm sorry , talk .
you know i just sit here listening , and you never let me talk .
and above all , just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever ...
wait a minute .
you 've got to show her respect , you 've got to show her that you 're not like joe ...
wait a minute .
you 're an inspiration lloyd ; you should go on the seven hundred club or something .
look at his face , he did the deed .
lloyd , it 's us .
he 's got that nervous talking thing . i told him not to speak .
i told him to be himself .
meaning that she made the second date a family audition , which is the kiss of death for lloyd .
meaning ?
lloyd is doomed .
i 'm sorry . it 's just you 're a really nice guy , and we do n't want to see you get hurt .
i would n't get my hopes up lloyd .
diane court does not realise how good-looking she is .
trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess .
well , where mr carroll uses the word 'love ' , i look for a new word .
he wants to leave things on a good note .
did you see what mr carroll wrote in my yearbook ? well , he ridiculed me all year long , and then he writes , `` you 're a real live-wire , love mr carroll . '' y'know , it 's all so phoney .
come on , it 's graduation .
i do n't feel anything .
if you were diane court , would you honestly fall for lloyd ?
hey , i know this is a strange thing to say , but maybe diane court really likes lloyd .
what is wrong with this girl ?
it 's too much pressure , it 's not his crowd .
why ?
well , you do n't have to be so dramatic about it .
i just saw joe . he 's here .
i wrote sixty-three songs this year . they 're all about joe , and i 'm going to play every single one of them tonight .
alright .
i 'll put this past my boss
confirm this with my office and my client .
i can put that together .
he 'd like to start serving immediately .
and i want to turn the home over to the state .
i can accept that .
one hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months .
one hundred thousand dollar fine and three months ?
i ca n't give you that . this guy 's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years . he 's been getting it from every end . i 'd love to hear his story .
'cause i 'm a guy , i have pride .
lloyd , why do you have to be like this ?
i 'm not going back there . i do n't even know who you 're talking about .
visit her at the home .
look , why do n't you just call diane again ?
that was a mistake . the rain on my car is a baptism . the new me . iceman , power lloyd . my assault on the world begins now . believe in myself , answer to no one ... you probably got it all figured out , corey . if you start out depressed , everything 's kind of a pleasant surprise .
i 'm going to take out diane court again .
lloyd , she 's being difficult .
i do n't know what to say to you , except goodbye .
hi .
hello .
you 're right .
do n't say that , it 's not good for you . you 're ...
i 'm so ashamed dad .
take it easy how mad you make me , i 'm the only dad you 've got .
no , i will . i do n't want to leave something out because i know i can say anything to you . you 're a liar , and a thief .
that 's right , work it out .
no . i told you everything , you lied to me . i would have done anything for you .
why are you being so hateful to me ? is this because of lloyd ?
i trusted you . i stood up in court five years ago and i picked you .
alright , alright . go ahead . when i 'm old , give me someone like me , but go ahead .
you let me believe you . you knew you were guilty , and you let me become a part of it . god , how ... how could you ...
i made their lives better .
no , but you stole from them .
no , you do n't know what it is . it 's not for me . this money 's for you , for when you come back from england with honors to set you up , so you do n't have to depend on anybody again . diane , i take better care of these people than their families do . i care for them , i give them flowers , i feed them , i wipe their mouths ...
yes , i ...
you think you know what this money is ?
you stole from them , you lied to me . how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ?
honey , about what ?
what am i supposed to think ?
honey , it 's not what you think .
but i found the money .
i swear to god .
swear to god .
honey !
swear to god , i need to know the truth .
sweetheart , no . do n't be ridiculous .
dad , did you do it ? did you take that money ?
what happened to you ?
just finishing up in here .
dad , are you okay in there ?
well then do n't pick it up . you know what 's best .
if i pick it up , we 'll only get back together .
dad , i love him .
'i like him ' ? diane , i 'm talking about being honest with people , being decent ...
dad , in a million years , i would never give him a pen . what 's wrong with having some fun ? i like him .
diane , i 'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy . give him a present , here , let him know you still care . give him this pen .
dad , you and i have talked about this . lloyd and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory .
diane , you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments , no strings , because after you get over there , things are going to change . people change .
unbelievable . this is a nightmare .
well listen to me . now , i know you like him , i know he 's nothing like those frat kids you ca n't stand , but honey , after the excitement wears off , then what , huh ? what are you going to talk about ? what do you have in common ? you 're going to be part of an international think-tank , and he 's going to be kicking punching bags .
i like him a lot .
do you love him ?
dad , why are you acting this way ? is this because of the other morning ?
diane ! alright , let 's stop this right now . let 's not put our energy into something ridiculous . this is n't even smart thinking .
you 're not listening to me .
bon voyage .
it does n't feel right to me . i , i do n't even have the right luggage yet .
you 're going .
but listen , if i had a friend in the same position , i would tell her to delay a year .
you 're going .
dad , maybe i should n't go with all that 's happening to you .
dad , no . but i did n't want any problems , so i decided not to sleep with him .
did he ever get rough with you ?
sit down .
dad , yes . and i 'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now .
lloyd ?
i know that .
do you wan na make things easier on me ? now tell me where you were because this is , this is bullshit . you can say anything to me , i hope you still know that .
i 'm fine .
you 've always called before , always . now i 'm not asking what you did , i just want to know that you 're alright .
dad , i 'm so sorry . i know this is a bad time .
you bet you should have called . you still live at home . do n't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning , do n't make me call hospitals .
i was irresponsible , i should have called .
you should be .
dad , i 'm sorry .
morning .
which they did , and every once in a while on a commercial , you can hear me scream .
oh yeah . there was , uh , somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio , and , uh , we got this telephone call , this guy is making a sound effects record , and he 'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream .
so anyway , these two federal marshals meet the plane , and they take our address , and they ask us never to fly with 'friendly skies ' again .
okay , i give up .
which they did . let me finish .
and then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around .
so anyway , they closed the doors , and she starts to scream . i 've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that .
crash paranoia .
i knew how planes flew , but i was still a little nervous .
well , let me start it . i 'm flying down to los angeles on business , and i decide to take her on her first aeroplane .
now why ca n't i tell the story ?
dad .
she 's not the world 's greatest flyer , let me tell you . when she was eight years old , she ...
goodnight .
goodnight .
well , i do n't think he 's really been embarrassed by it .
lloyd was such a gentleman . he was funny and nervous and strange , and i met people that i never would have met before , then i blew it . i called him basic . can you believe i did that ?
wait a minute . how was lloyd ?
dad , i 'm so glad i went . goodnight .
morning honey .
no , listen to me . you 're the best in the country , do n't you understand ? it 's like a pyramid . it starts out with everybody , and it narrows through your life and through everything , and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents . and it 's you . so tell me something , where 's the flaw in that ? there is no flaw .
do n't do this to me . you 're too good at making me nervous .
we 'll worry about that later . now come on , tell me that you 're special .
god , i 'll have to go on a plane .
you 're going to take a big step , a big leap , and before you do , i just want one thing from you , miss . you stand up straight and admit you 're special .
i won ?
you won it . you 're going to study at the finest institute at england , the toughest fellowship in the country , and you won .
are you kidding ? you 're not kidding ? you 're not kidding !
no , no , just listen . you won the wreath fellowship .
tell me , is it bad news ?
i just had a phone call .
what ?
i love you too honey .
i love you dad .
i 'm sorry .
stop it , stop it , stop it .
diane , in a million years , you could never be a ... priss . it 's all working out for you honey , do n't you see ? it 's all working out , just like we planned . all the years of summer school , all the vacations you gave up , it 's all working out just the way we planned ...
everybody thinks i 'm a priss .
no , wait a minute . everybody thinks you 're what ?
i was standing up there and looking at all the people , and i felt like they did n't know me . i mean , maybe i should n't have taken all those courses out of school , because everybody thinks i ... forget it .
they really applauded you today honey .
oh god , i do n't need all these presents . i do n't know any kid who got a car , i mean ...
now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that i kept . now it 's yours . go ahead , open it .
god , that 's ... this is ridiculous .
well , since i 'm not only your father , i 'm also your friend ; i had to get you two presents .
what are you doing ?
okay , i promise i will . just come here a minute , i want to show you something .
dad , you have to teach me to suture this weekend .
well , it 's almost over . we 've gone to school together for three years , and we 've been through a lot . but with that training out of high school gone , what 's going to happen to us ? we all know what the answers are . we want to be happy , go to college , own a car , maybe raise a family . but what if that does n't happen ? i have , i have to be honest though , i have all the hope and ambition in the world . but when i think about the future , the truth is , i am really ... scared .
ha !
okay .
alright , no more , i 'm going to save it .
oh no , no , it 's ... it 's wonderful . it 's ... no , do n't worry about it . you 're very funny . go back , that 's great !
i did n't think anyone would get it .
oh yeah !
you like it ?
ha ! go back ! what a great line !
having taken a few courses at the university this year , i have glimpsed our future , and all i can say is ... go back .
why ? it 's fine . it 's nice .
well , it 's almost over . we 've gone to school together for three years ... i might cut that part out .
okay . oh , here 's ray . just talk to him because when you do n't , your mouth turns down .
you will ?
alright .
if they ask you questions , and they probably will ask you questions , would you please say something nice about him mum ? help him ?
if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier . you know , your room is always ready for you , you can always come home if ... alright , what do you want me to do ?
i just wonder what could be more important than what 's going on with dad .
you know , i do n't even know if you 've got a young man in your life ?
this is me telling you about me .
diane , i do have a history with this man , and it 's not the greatest . i see you so seldom , i 'd really rather know about you .
mom , please ?
i know .
no . you just described every great success story . alright , it 's alright .
nobody thought we 'd do this . nobody really thinks it 's going to work , do they ?
how 's it going ?
not right now , thanks .
alright , personalised flight care from corey . books , cassettes , magazines , anything ?
okay .
right , i 'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens , which is going to be soon .
good to know .
so when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding ' , you know everything 's going to be okay .
okay .
alright , high level air safety tips . if anything happens , it 'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight , right ?
okay .
okay , good , this is all very noble .
i 'm fine .
i love you . please , i love you .
one more time would be nice .
i love you . how many more times do i have to say it ?
what ?
i love you .
hurt me again ? not a chance , do n't worry about it .
everything else means nothing to me . if i hurt you again , i 'll die .
you do ?
my father 's guilty . he lied to me , he lied to everybody . i just left home ... i need you .
what do you want ?
i 'm sorry .
what do you want ?
oh shit .
then do n't do it .
do n't be mean , this is hard for me too .
what is that ? what are you doing with your hands ? talk to me , you 're talking like that girl sheila .
lloyd , i love you , okay ?
what , i 'm sorry i said that . forget i said it , it 's what i thought i meant , but forget it .
you have corey and dc . i have my dad .
you told your dad ?
just my dad .
did you tell anybody ?
no , that 's fine . she 'll tell everybody , but that 's fine .
she figured it out . i 'm sorry if that upsets you .
why , did you tell corey what happened ?
did you talk to corey ?
no .
is this because of your dad ?
no i did n't .
you shared it with a dick .
lloyd , we shared the most intimate thing two people can share .
yeah you do .
no , i do n't , i do n't .
i feel like a dick . you must think i 'm a dick .
i think that we should stop going out on dates .
well , if we 're friends , why ca n't we see each other ?
no . we decided that we 're friends . i mean , i know it 's a terrible word ...
it sounded like you did .
no , no .
'cause i 'm worried , did you just break up with me ?
we decided ...
okay , what did we just decide ?
yeah , uh-huh .
okay . it 's good knowing this .
we 'll see .
okay , how much time do you need ? i mean , you know , i mean you 'll be leaving in a little while , so that 's answered some questions .
yeah .
you need to study ?
well , i need to study , and ...
what 's wrong ?
i think that we should spend some time apart .
say what ?
how can i look at you and say this ?
what ? this is a good level , is n't it ?
i know . lloyd , let 's not start putting things on this level .
i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .
i do n't know what you 're going to say , but i think that ...
how do you know what i 'm going to say ?
no , we do n't have to say it .
i 've never sent a letter like that , you know ? i mean , i felt like i wanted to tell you something , but i did n't put it in the letter , and i did n't say it , but i want to say it now , i 'm not sure if i should say it , you know , 'cause people always say it and do n't mean it , but i think that i mean it , so , um , i just wanted to tell you ...
it was wonderful .
why did n't you tell me ?
uh-huh . it was wonderful .
it did ?
your letter came yesterday .
check your mail tomorrow . i sent you a letter , a letter .
here are some blankets . this is a good song , this is a really good song .
i do n't know . i 'm happy .
then why are you shaking ?
i do n't think i am .
you 're cold .
i do n't think so .
you 're shaking .
no .
yes . are you shaking ?
are you comfortable ?
yeah .
let 's get outta here . you want to ?
well no , it 's not noble , but it 's a good aid to your lesson .
this is so noble .
now , go into second . little more gas ... yeah ! you can get this whole problem . now , maybe you downshift to first ?
yeah .
little more gas . ease it up . hold on- minor setback . now you feel confident , right ?
oh . i was putting the ...
yeah , a little bit . listen , this is important . when you feel it start to give , put the clutch in .
am i wrecking my car ?
okay , this is important ...
right .
if you 'll just maybe ease it into second .
yeah ?
yeah . now , when you feel like you 're confident , ...
i 'm doing alright .
you know how it 'll come out and feel ... y'know ... little more , little more ... yeah , yeah , that 's right . go round just at first , keep it in first , just feel it .
yeah .
yeah , just keep going first , keep going around . get the feel of it , feel the clutch , when you put it in a little ?
friends with potential .
yeah . with potential .
be friends ?
do n't worry about it . we 're just having coffee . we 'll be anti- social .
i just ca n't have any social life right now .
no .
i just do n't want it to get too heavy . i feel really overloaded . i have this theory of convergence , that good things always happen with bad things . but i know you have to deal with them at the same time , but i just , i mean i do n't know why they have to happen at the same time , i mean , i do n't know why , i just wish i could work out ... am i just babbling ? do you know what i mean ?
it 's okay , everybody does that .
well ... just meet her .
what did you say ?
yes .
wait , wait . you told her about me ?
she 's amazing . she 's ninety-three , she 's a writer , and i told her about you .
okay .
you have to meet bess .
i 'll see you there . bye .
okay , bye .
okay , bye , i will .
stop by later .
really ? um ... i ... well ... you 're really turning me around here ,
i think that 's ageism , and that 's , that 's being prejudiced against people because they 're old . maybe their mouths do n't work as well as yours .
well , except for one thing . i used to work at a smorgasbord , and , and the old people would flock there , and , and they loved to eat . and they just jammed their mouths , you know ? the used to eat with their mouths open , and you know , it 's just too much for me . you get to be thinking about how short life is , and how maybe , maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you 're frying burgers
come on .
me ? sure i do .
i know you think my job is strange . you do n't like old people , do you ?
wo n't you see me later ?
i usually have a break after the dinner service , if you want to stop by .
after work ?
i had a checklist in mind . i thought that if babies were on the plane , the plane could n't crash . but all the babies were crying , and i thought they knew something i did n't .
oh .
mmmm .
you think so ?
i think you should wear that .
yeah ?
nice one .
yeah , i 've had it forever . i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up .
boy , this is a mother dictionary .
or , or i could always wear this one .
yeah .
then call me later .
today is tomorrow .
then call me tomorrow .
sixteen weeks is a long time .
i only have something like sixteen weeks .
so am i. i want to see you again . i want to see you as much as i can before you leave . i said it .
no , i 'm serious .
job ? being a great date .
so what 's your job this summer ?
basic . hmmm .
you 're a great date . i 've never really gone out with someone as basic as you .
what ?
you know what ?
twisted ?
thanks . but either way it still feels ...
watch out for that glass .
well , my parents split up when i was thirteen , and ... god , i actually had to ... i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them . so i chose my dad . it just felt safer that way , you know ?
sure i do .
yeah , but that 's an old story , you do n't want to hear it .
it 's just you and your dad , right ?
yeah . i 'm so glad we did this .
that 's cool then .
yeah , but i feel like i fit in for the first time , you know ? like i just held them far away from me , and they did the same to me .
they knew of you . now they know you .
nobody knew me before tonight .
mine say stuff like `` lloyd , see you around maybe ''
alright , this is some of the things they wrote me ; `` glad i finally met you '' , `` you always seemed nice '' , `` wish i could have known you more '' ...
bye .
have a good sleep .
i hereby surrender my duties as keymaster , give me a beer .
thank-you .
it 's the worst job since keymaster .
he does this every year ?
yeah .

so it 's an honor ?
yeah , i have to judge who can drive home and who ca n't . i have to keep their keys .
keymaster ?

yeah . i read about your fellowship in the paper , and i 'm very glad you called me back .
hi . you called me ?
no noise , no sound , no movement , nothing ! hello , diane ?
look at those eyes .
thank-you . the real world .
you 've got ta get her out of your head , man .
you 're freaking out here man .
man , you 're bringing me down !
hey man , i was in love once . i got hurt really bad . i never wan na go through that again .
man , you never had a chance with a girl like that .
it 's your castle , man .
your only mistake is that you did n't dump her first . diane court is a showpony . you need a stallion , my friend . walk with us and you walk tall .
man , all you got ta do is find a girl who looks just like her , nail her , and then dump her man , get her off your mind .
work that jab , work that hook , work that jab , okay , take a break , take a break .
pain !
hook up the jab , hook up the jab .
no my brother , you have to go buy your own .
he 's back . hey my brother , can i borrow a copy of your 'hey soul classics ' ?
yeah !
yeah , you got ta go 'yeah ' , strength . poor little man .
yeah .
just knowing a person like that exists , knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'i still ca n't help loving you ' . that 's got ta be a good thing , right ? that 's got ta be a good thing .
just her name .
it does , it does if it 's the version signed 'i still ca n't help loving you ' . read that .
she ca n't still be angry at this , it 's got ta get better .
i know this part , keep reading .
`` you ca n't know the horrible disappointment i feel ... ''
i 'm incarcerated , lloyd ! i do n't deserve to lose my daughter over this . i do n't deserve to have you as my go-between . and i ca n't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you .
i 'm the distraction that 's going to england with her sir . are you alright sir ? are you okay ?
you 're not a permanent part of her life . you 're a distraction .
i know . but then i reconsidered . 'cause i figured out what i really wan na do with my life , what i want to do for a living is i wan na be with your daughter . i 'm good at it .
very talented .
i know
she 's very successful .
i know .
well lloyd , i admire you for not hitching a ride . you know , my daughter 's a lot different to you .
am i going ? am i going to england ? i 've thought about this quite a bit , and i 've realised what i probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what i wan na do with my life , do all the stuff that i 've been avoiding in a big way . i mean , diane and i can wait for each other , right ? what 's she gon na ... she 's gon na run off with some english guy ? there 's no way .
are you ?
that 's one of the things i wanted to talk to you about sir .
are you going to england with her lloyd ?
she would n't get out of the car . i brought her all the way here , she said she was going to come here , and she would n't get out of the car . but i thought that is was important , that she come to see you , because i know that if you go somewhere and you do n't deal with your family stuff , then you 're just gon na , she 's gon na , um ...
i just wanted to say that i 've thought about everything , and i 've decided something . i 'm going to give you another chance . maybe no one 's listening , or maybe your father 's listening . mr court , if you 're listening to this , hello , how are you ?
go ahead , pick it up if you want .
hi , lloyd . this is my eighth and final call ...
you mean like career ? uh , i do n't know . i 've , i 've thought about this quite a bit sir , and i 'd have to say considering what 's waiting out there for me , i do n't want to sell anything , buy anything or process anything as a career . i do n't want to sell anything bought or processed , or buy anything sold or processed , or ... process anything sold , bought or processed , or repair anything sold , bought or processed , you know , as a career i do n't want to do that . so , uh , my father 's in the army , he wants me to join , but i ca n't work for that corporation , so what i 've been doing lately is kickboxing , which is really a , uh , new sport , but i think it 's got a good future . as far as career longevity goes , i do n't really know , because , you know , you ca n't really tell . your training sticks as a fighter , you know , but it 's no good , you know , you have to be great , but i ca n't really tell if i 'm great until i 've had a couple of pro fights . but i have n't been knocked out yet . i do n't know , i ca n't figure it all out tonight sir , i 'm going to hang with your daughter .
no , really .
i 'm totally and completely serious .
seriously , lloyd .
spend as much time as possible with diane before she leaves .
yeah lloyd . what are your plans for the future ?
well , we pay for the [ ? ] . that guy did n't want to part with it , a little matter of nine thousand dollars .
how do you pay for one of those ?
thanks lloyd .
yeah . honey ?
how ya doing ? is she around ?
fine lloyd .
hello . heard about that graduation present . really quite a car . look , i know you 're busy , you do n't ' have to retain me , but you can trust me . i 'll tell you a couple of things about myself , i 'm nineteen , been overseas for a couple of semesters , but now i 'm back . i 'm an athlete , so i rarely drink . kickboxing . you heard of kickboxing , sport of the future ? don 'the dragon ' wilson , lenny [ ? ] merciless , one of the champions of the sport ? i can see by your face , no . my point is , you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours .
hello lloyd .
hi . lloyd dobler , sir . pleasure to meet you .
jim court ... no , this is her father . i 'll take ...
okay . good afternoon . goodbye .

okay , i 'll give here the message .
oh . okay then ... lloyd dobler , 555-1342 .
why do n't i just get your phone number , that 's usually how it works .
uh , no , not really , no actually , basically , you do n't know me . i 'm a friend of your daughters ; well i sat with her yesterday at the mall .

stop freaking with her head man . just stop playing with her mind , you know ? she 's a human being . she 's a person . she 's very talented , you know .
so what 's up ?
joe . joe . she 's written sixty-five songs . they 're all about you . they 're all about pain .
hang tough , lloyd .
how many people really know what they want though ? i mean , a lot of them think that they have to know , right ? but inside , they do n't really know , so , i do n't know . but i know that i do n't know .
lloyd , everybody in that party put something down on their record except you .
we 'll just make an appointment for you at seattle junior college .
my dad 's a lieutenant colonel in the army , he wants me to join , he wants to pull some strings . i mean , there 's no possible way .
do n't make this like a counsel , lloyd . i got statistics i can show you , i got graphs i can show you . that 's all the stuff i can show you , it all says the same thing . you have to decide on a career .
what ?
lloyd .
no way .
you missed every one of your career counselling sessions . call me obsessive , compulsive , but let 's do this right now .
how ya doin ' miss evans ?
lloyd . lloyd dobler , i 've got you .
i do n't really know where we are .

i love you too .
i love you man
alright !
we finally graduated , big dude guy !
now i 'm back , and you know what i 'm going to do now ? i 'm going to have a good time . so are you .
now you 're back .
things worked out . i made some money over there , had some laughs , you know . it was good .
nothing 's changed . then again , something has changed , has n't it ?
how do you do ? what can i get you , what 're you drinking ?
oskar - my friend lena .
my plant manager is somewhere on this train . if it leaves with him on it , it 'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why .
the gentleman thinks a mistake 's been made .
klaus tauber .
i did n't ask you about the list , i asked you your name .
sir , the list is correct .
what 's your name ?
i 'm talking to a clerk .
he 's on the list . if he were an essential worker , he would not be on the list . he 's on the list . you ca n't have him .
well , let 's find him .
he is .
itzhak stern ? he 's on the list .
he 's essential . without him , everything comes to a grinding halt . if that happens -
it 's up to you .
should i stay ?
it 's a beautiful city .
should i stay ?
i feel like an old-fashioned couple . it feels good .
what ?
war .
luck .
a charade ? how could it be a charade ?
it 's not a charade , all this ?
you would , though . that 's what i 'm saying .
i do n't have to like her just because you do . it does n't work that way .
what -
oskar , please -
you know what , you 'd like her .
breslau ? i ca n't go to breslau . not now .
in breslau .
all right , okay , let 's talk .
i 'd love to , it 'll have to wait until i get back . i have to leave .
there are some things that are unclear . we need to talk .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
your friend amon goeth has been arrested .
the guards are n't allowed on the factory floor . they make my workers nervous .
where are the guards ?
all you have to do is tell me what it 's worth to you . what 's a person worth to you .
yeah , all right , do n't tell me , i 'll go along with it , it 's just irritating to me i ca n't figure it out .
you did , but you did n't .
i just told you .
if you admit to making three , then it 's four , actually . but how ?
yeah , sure .
it 's good for me - i know them , i 'm familiar with them . it 's good for you - you 'll be compensated . it 's good for the army . you know what i 'm going to make ? artillery shells . tank shells . they need that . everybody 's happy .
you 're not telling me something .
look -
oh , this is `` good business '' in your opinion . you 've got to move them , the equipment , everything to czechoslovakia - it does n't make any sense .
it 's good business .
what are you , moses ? what is this ? where 's the money in this ? what 's the scam ?
these people , my people , i want my people .
you want these people .
i do n't know . soon .
when ?
they 're taking mine . when i said they did n't have a future i did n't mean tomorrow . auschwitz .
you took my workers .
i got a shipment of hungarians coming in , i got to make room for them . it 's always something .
what 's going on ?
i tried to call you , i 'm running a little late , this is taking longer than i thought . have a drink .
i want him . come on , let 's go inside , let 's have a good time .
what do you want for him , i 'll give it to you .
he 's important to my business .
you held back stern . you held back the one man most important to my business .
i pay you too much .
it 's true . never happen in cracow , though , we all love you too much .
well , you 've been through it . you know . you could make things easier for me .
do you have any idea what 's involved ? the paperwork alone ? forget you got to build it all , getting the fucking permits , that 's enough to drive you crazy . then the engineers show up . they stand around and they argue about drainage - i 'm telling you , you 'll want to shoot somebody , i 've been through it , i know .
true .
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude . that it 's not some vague thing with you like with some guys .
yeah , what 's that ?
scherner told me something else about you .
some of the boys went crazy , what 're you going to do ? you 're right , it 's bad business , but it 's over with , it 's done . occasionally , sure , okay , you got to make an example . but that 's good business .
it 's bad business .
we 're going to be making so much money , none of this is going to matter -
every day that goes by , i 'm losing money . every worker that is shot , costs me money - i have to get somebody else , i have to train them -
they 're mine !
they 're not gone , they 're here .
i go to work the other day , there 's nobody there . nobody tells me about this , i have to find out , i have to go in , everybody 's gone -
i 'd say i 'd get you one but the guy who made it , he 's probably dead , i do n't know .
he looks great , though , does n't he ? i have to know - where do you get a suit like that ? what is that , silk ? it 's great .
you 're kidding .
you know , they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner .
good .
we started without you .
takes diamonds to stay on this list .
what do i got for you ?
you want to stay on it ? what do you got for me ?
of course i 'm on it .
hey , poldek , how 's it going ? you know about the list ? you 're on it .
yeah , i can .
ghetto police . i 'm a policeman now , can you believe it ?
look it up .
this is not my problem .
i asked for metal , you gave me glass .
so i 'm responsible for the weather ?
my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army . but by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke , the whole truckload .
you asked for shoe polish .
you do n't recognize it ? maybe that 's because it 's not what i asked for .
what 's that ?
you 're a good man .
yeah , okay .
god bless you , sir .
that 's great , thanks .
i work hard for you . i 'll continue to work hard for you .
that 's great .
the ss beat me up . they would have killed me , but i 'm essential to the war effort , thanks to you .
you 're welcome , i 'm sure you 're doing a great job .
i want to thank you , sir , for giving me the opportunity to work .
yeah ? yeah , that 'd be nice , let me get my coat .
i thought maybe you 'd like to come over , have some dinner , some of the people are coming over .
i 've been here . i guess i have n't been out .
i mean where have you been ? nobody 's seen you around for a while .
i 'm having a drink , come on in , we 'll have a drink .
what are you doing ?
things are great , things are great .
good . how 's it going ?
how should i know ? it 's broken . see what you can do .
what 's wrong with it ?
she 's good .
what 's the matter , everything all right at home ? mila 's okay ?
yeah .
how you feeling , all right ?
i do n't know , ten or twelve . that 's a good color . dark blues , grays .
how many ?
nice things cost money .
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs ?
there 's nothing in the stores .
like this ?
pistols , rifles , carbines ... i 'd be grateful .
pistols ?
it kind of looks that way .
we 're losing the war , are n't we .
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate . i 'd like the chance to defend myself . i 'd like my wife to have that chance . my civilian engineers . my secretary .
wine ?
oh , god , you do n't have a drink ?
i need a drink .
thank you .
how do you do ?
are you kidding , i never miss a party . police chief rasch , my wife emilie .
oskar , good of you to come .
did i threaten anybody here ? i stated a simple fact .
he does n't deserve your loyalty . more important , he 's not worth you making threats against us .
he 's got no style , we all know that . so , we should hang him for it ?
he 's a friend of yours , you want to help him out . tell me this , though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation ? i 've yet to see it . never a courtesy . never a thank you note . he forgets my wife at christmas time -
so i 'll talk to him about it .
the place produces nothing . i should n't say that - nothing it produces reaches the army . that 's not all right .
done . lets not talk about it anymore , let 's have a good time .
that 'd be fine .
whoever . they 're the ones . they 'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me .
what others ?
no , look . it 's the others . they 're the ones causing these delays .
i 'd never ask you for money , you know that . i do n't even like talking about it - money , favors - i find it very awkward , it makes me very uncomfortable -
you did so much .
i did n't do enough .
there will be generations because of what you did .
if i 'd made more money ... i threw away so much money , you have no idea . if i 'd just ...
oskar , there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you . look at them .
i could 've got more ... if i 'd just ... i do n't know , if i 'd just ... i could 've got more ...
no , no , what , what is it ?
i 'll talk to you later .
you 'll lose money .
you do n't ? i do . i see a difference .
i know what you 're saying , but i do n't see the difference .
no ?
there 's a rumor you 've been going around miscalibrating the machines . i do n't think that 's a good idea .
well , sure . so would i. so would you . i would n't worry about it . we 'll get it right one of these days .
they 're withholding payment .
well , that 's to be expected . they have to understand . these are start-up problems . this is n't pots and pans , this is a precise business . i 'll write them a letter .
they arrived , can you believe it ?
they arrived .
stern .
we need to talk .
yes .
that 's very generous of you .
give or take what , stern - how many - count them .
eight hundred , give or take .
more .
four hundred , four fifty -
well , i 'll talk to somebody . i 'll take care of it .
i think it 's too late .
i 'll talk to him .
there 's nothing you can do . i 'm not asking you to do anything . you came into my office .
i 'll admit it 's a weakness . i do n't think he enjoys it . all right , he does enjoy it , so what ? what do you expect me to do about it ?
and killing .
you have to understand , goeth 's under enormous pressure . you have to think of it in his situation . he 's got this whole place to run , he 's responsible for everything that goes on here , all these people - he 's got a lot of things to worry about . and he 's got the war . which brings out the worst in people . never the good , always the bad . always the bad . but in normal circumstances , he would n't be like this . he 'd be all right . there 'd be just the good aspects of him . which is a wonderful crook . a guy who loves good food , good wine , the ladies , making money ...
it 's dangerous . it 's dangerous , to me , personally .
what other point is -
no , i 'm not losing money , that 's not the point .
are you losing money ?
you think i do n't know what you 're doing ? you 're so quiet all the time ? i know .
oskar -
i got to go , i 'll see you .
thank you .
this , i do n't know , maybe you can trade it for something .
ah , yes .
christmas presents .
you try to be fair to people , they walk out the door ; i 've never understood that . what 's next ?
do what ?
do n't ever do that to me again .
there 's a machinist outside who 'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job .
what ?
the war could end .
any reason to think next month will be worse ?
yes .
better this month than last ?
yes .
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it 's till hot . we 're doing well ?
but it 's less . it 's less than what i would pay a pole . that 's the point i 'm trying to make . poles cost more .
the jewish worker 's salary , you pay it directly to the ss , not to the worker . he gets nothing .
what was that about the ss , the rate , the ... ?
they should be .
i do n't know anybody who 'd be interested in that .
something they can hold in their hands .
pots and pans .
well , they would n't own it , i 'd own it . i 'd pay them back in product . they can trade it on the black market , do whatever they want , everybody 's happy .
jews can no longer own businesses , sir , that 's why this one 's for sale .
jews , yeah . investors .
the contracts ? that 's the easy part . finding the money to buy the company , that 's hard .
get the contracts and i 'm sure you 'll do very well . in fact the worse things get the better you 'll do . it was a `` pleasure . ''
i think most people right now have other priorities .
once the war ends , forget it , but for now it 's great , you could make a fortune . do n't you think ?
simple engineering , though , would n't you think ? change the machines around , whatever you do , you could make other things , could n't you ?
i was just the accountant .
of course he 's stealing from me , we 're in business together . what is this ? i 'm sitting here , suddenly everybody 's talking like this is something bad . we take from each other , we take from the army , everybody uses everybody , it works out , everybody 's happy .
he 's stealing from you , oskar .
there 's taking money and there 's taking money , you know that . he 's taking money .
what 's he done that 's so bad - take money ? that 's a crime ? come on , what are we here for , to fight a war ? we 're here to make money , all of us .
he was a metal press operator , quite skilled .
a one-armed machinist , oskar ?
no .
would it do any good ?
file a grievance with the economic office , it 's your right .
i lost a day of production . i lost a worker . i expect to be compensated .
it 's got nothing to do with reality , oskar , i know it and you know it , it 's a matter of national priority to these guys . it 's got a ritual significance to them , jews shoveling snow .
that does n't work , sir .
we 're going to bring her in . hide her out for a coupla days . and we 're issuing a campus lock-in this evening . no one is allowed out after dark .
what now ?
no , we got pressure from california state . the man practically has clemency . we ca n't run the risk of falsely accusing him . he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move .
ca n't we hold him ?
37 usages of himbry located in the registar 's office . 9 tatum 's , 47 riley 's . and that 's just on campus . it 's hopeless .
how 's the name search going ?
thanks , dewey , but i was thinking i 'd pull jesse off ...
i can do it , captain .
we 're aware of that .
the killer was trying to get to her . that sorority girl was a distraction .
we know that , son .
on national television .
i would say we are now officially baffled .
broad daylight , a crowded movie theatre . this is too much fun for one person .
you 're sure about this two person thing ?
they 've broken their pattern .
he 's broken his pattern .
find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name ...
jesus christ . captain tyler flies out of his seat and into action .
the first two were stabbed without thought . the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
we do n't know if it 's random . we have n't been able to connect the victims .
take the neighborhood .
attic , garage , basement , nothing .
have you checked the ...
okay , okay . i 'll call now . i 'll call you back .
... campus security ... send someone ... check out ... place ...
i 'm losing you .
hang up ... call ...
what ? i ca n't hear you ...
do n't do that . hang up ... call ...
that 's smart .
outside .
i ca n't believe you 're alone in that house .
stop it ...
kill , kill , kill , kill , hah , hah , hah , hah ...
where ?
i heard a noise .
what is it ?
shit .
it 's hell week . chill . the movie murders have brought out the crazies . it 's nothing .
no , some creep asshole trying to scare me .
alright , alright ... i 'll call you back .
do n't . think bailey .
i wo n't .
that shit . he only calls you when he 's drunk . do n't go over there .
no , he quit - the whole god thing -- he has issues . the previews for next week ...
thought he was doing aa .
no , they broke up again . bailey wo n't stop drinking and sarah ca n't take it anymore .
do n't forget to set the alarm .
whaaaatt ?
no , it 's me .
hello ? ted ?
i 'm impatient . look , do you wan na leave a message for someone ?
i 'm inquisitive .
why do you always answer a question with a question ?
why would you wan na do that ?
what if i said goodbye ?
what if i said you ?
`` drink with your brain . '' that 's our motto . who are you calling for ?
that 's too bad .
i 'm designated driver . i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride .
why are n't you there ?
we 're co-sponsoring the acid rain mixer at the sig ep . house tonight .
where is everybody ?
who do you want to speak with ? nobody 's here .
that 's okay .
oh , i 'm sorry . my bad . i thought you were someone else .
ted ? where are you ? are you drinking ? hold on .
someone who wants to talk to you .
cici . who 's this ?
who is this ?
yes .
i 'll go . i do n't mind . really .
tina , it 's dawnie . i 'm on my way . cici follows her back into the living room .
just some asshole trying to scare me .
i had to change . did anyone call ?
i thought you were going to the mixer ?
i live here .
jesus , you scared me . what are you doing here ?
not until youre dead .
its over , cotton .
i get my revenge and make some fast cash .
please , cotton , dont do this .
its perfect , sidney . no one will ever suspect me . i have proof . im the victim .
you 're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother .
what ?
it helped me realize one thing .
did it ?
i just thought if i saw you face to face , maybe it would help .
cotton , there is n't one day , one hour , one minute when i 'm not reminded of what i 've done . i have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being . and i wish i had in me what you need to hear but i do n't think the words exist .
i wish it was just a year . i lost everything because of you . i have nothing now . look at me , this is what i 've become . a long silence . sidney is hanging on by threads .
how ? what could i say that would make a difference ? i took away a year of your life -- how do i apologize for that ?
you wrote me a letter . very cordial . very appropriate .
i did that .
you could start with an apology .
what do you want from me , cotton ?
look , yesterday was n't my idea . that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings .
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
can we talk ?
cotton .
gale , i do n't know what i 'm doing from one moment to the next . i 'm just taking it as it comes .
do n't do anything stupid , cotton . you 've come to far .
you 've done nothing but get rich off of me . how many books have you sold , gale ? you think i do n't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights ?
cotton , i 've done nothing but help you .
no , gale , i do n't have any rights . you made sure of that .
you have a right to be angry .
now , gale , you were so instrumental in my freedom . you 're not having character doubts now , are you ?
did you do it ?
you know the story , gale . man falsely accused , sent to prison , proved innocent , released back into the real world and never trusted again . want the exclusive ?
enter cotton weary .
but youll never get away with it .
finish what my son started .
what are you going to do ?
where do you think he got it ? mental illness is heriditary . who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother ? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance .
jesus , youre just as whacked as your son .
youre all in this together ?
i couldnt believe you didnt recognize me . you even interviewed me for your book .
look , i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win . okay ? i 'm not interested in the scoop anymore . excuse me .
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home .
no , i do n't .
already did . he 's the perfect suspect , do n't you think ?
why do n't you ask them ?
and are the police sure about that ?
home -- where he lives .
where is sidney 's father ?
tons and tons .
hi , gale , any leads ?
good for you .
i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year .
do i know you ? you look familiar .
and much richer as a result .
well , you know i 'm dear to the subject matter .
what are you doing here ? i thought you had retired from field reporting ?
fair enough .
job hazard . debbie salt , stringer -- newsweek . answer a few questions ?
look , i 'm sorry about the face .
you freakin ?
yeah .
no way .
she dumped me .
where 's sid ?
not one bit .
are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of greek life ?
definitely whitney .
`` and i hope life treats you kind and i hope you have all you dreamed of offffff . i wish you joyyy . ''
i think he 's doing dolly .
should we be worried about this guy ? is n't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying ?
i could use some therapy .
i was a sorority slut .
what 's your subject ?
my documentary is due on tuesday .
hey , it 's cool . hallie 's into it , i 'm into hallie ...
how do you put up with this greek shit ?
but nobody wants to see that . itll never go . theyll rewrite you . you dont want that .
yeah , were trying to send a message to hollywood . im really getting tired of all the happy endings . its just not reality . in the real world the good guys die , the innocent are punished , and the murderers inherit the earth .
youre not going to get away with this .
poor cotton , could life be a little more cruel ?
good question . you took the bait .
why ?
thats quick .
no . this is a set up .
go on , untie him .
then i 'll make this easy for you . i like you . i 'm crazy about you , sid . but i 'm gon na stay away . until you say otherwise .
it 's not you , derek . i do n't trust myself . i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men .
i do n't really know what happened in woodsboro , sid . but i know you do n't trust me .
no , it 's not .
i had the four o'clock shift . you were n't there . you had us worried . is everything okay ?
it 's under control .
what about your film ? is n't it due next week ? have you even started it ?
let us decide that .
my screwed up life should n't have to bleed onto my friends .
i think it 's out of your control .
this is exactly what i do n't want .
i 'll get my jacket .
lem me take you home .
the forbidden subject .
about what ?
i 'm sorry honey . i got behind .
where have you been ' ? you missed my shining moment . i won the macaroni sundae binge .
sid , you do n't have to .
it 's okay . i can peddle toilet paper .
do n't ask what you can do . no coddling . life rolls on status quo .
i 'm sorry , baby . what can i do ' ?
i skipped . too many `` that 's her '' looks .
how are you ? you were n't in class . i called as soon as i heard ...
tuitions expensive .
we had to have financing .
tails .
oh yeah . we figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press . its been an ongoing discussion . heads or tails ?
wait a sec , derek . we forgot to flip .
just for you , sid .
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings .
or it found us .
so we found a compromise .
and we didnt want to do that , sid . we wanted to give you your moneys worth .
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience ...
yeah , we really had our work cut out for us . it really is the curse of the sequel . the billy/stu things been done .
a twist ending if you will .
hope youre ready , sid . we got one last surprise for you .
and now , drum roll please ...
were hoping for the death penalty . i have this whole dead man walking swan song exit planned .
a verdict and premiere all on the same day . i love it .
the way i see it . well be arrested . go to prison . cash in on the home footage . secure a book deal . if all goes as planned , our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii .
of course not . who wants to ? whats the point if we dont get caught ? wheres the glamour in that ?
until now .
youre the one who got away .
youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there . its a whole world , sid . youre really popular amongst the demented .
we have our own website now . we dedicated a whole page to you .
i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly . hook , line ...
he sent me the cutest e-mail .
i find his work overwrought .
he hates oliver stone .
i really dont like that comparison , honey .
ever see natural born killers ? well , derek and i have this whole mickey/mallory-woody harrelson/juliette lewis thing going on .
yeah , how can we help ? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life ?
yeah , you look quizzical yet pensive .
i got it..
need some help , honey .
are n't most serial killers seemingly harmless ?
he seemed harmless .
randy somebody .
what guy ?
she 's got guards with her .
i did n't say she was alone . that guy -- from her home town showed up . they went off together .
you were n't supposed to leave her alone .
damned if i know . she ditched me .
where 's sid ?
and watch her til 8:00 -- i 've got to edit .
so you 'll relieve me at 2:30 ...
two .
there 's nothing . i 'm coming down .
dewey ?
no , wait here .
let 's go .
he filmed his victims .
jesus christ !
c'mon . let 's go .
maybe they never got here . he could have taken her anywhere .
over here .
this is all too familiar .
let 's find out .
ssshh ! what was that ?
hallie ?
shit ! it 's both of them . the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro . but they 've moved on- -they 're getting closer to sidney . they 're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill . they 're looking for the new tatum .
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
and joel 's pre-med .
they 're roomates .
we 'd break some furniture .
..and as lonely as i am ...
maybe not . but think about the sex . as frustrated as i am ...
dewey , you and i would never make it .
and it 's sexier in the dark .
that 's not the way it 's done .
can we turn the light on ?
a bloody knife . a ghost mask . something like that ?
what are we looking for ?
you broke my heart .
billy had alibis too .
solid alibis . he was with sidney when she was attacked .
he 's already got ta be a part of sid 's life . what do you know about this derek ?
meaning ?
if you were truly a copycat , would n't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ?
not good .
not good . how you doin ?
i also know that you 're an aging tv reporter slash writer who , despite huge tabloid success , has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner . a coupla failed relationships with -- i 'm guessing balding , older men -- have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone . but i bet sometimes , late at night , when you 're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled .
yeah ?
i know that .
and deep down i 'm a good person ? make no mistake , dewey , i 'm a shit .
i think you 're all an act .
you 're a hard one to figure out . gale it 's that complex yet shallow quality . it 's deliberate .
mood swing . i 'm manic depressive .
so what made you change your mind about sidney ?
no , i 'm the one who 's sorry . i misjudged you . now if you 'll excuse me , i have some oozing to do .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know what else to say except i 'm sorry .
how do you know my dim-witted inexperience is n't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people 's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation ?
i never meant to imply ...
page 41 . `` deputy dewey oozed with inexperience . ''
you have every right to be upset .
no , what you are is a money hungry , fame- seeking liar and -- forgive me for saying -- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be .
oh dewey , i 'm sorry .
page 32 . `` deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence . '' i think you 've explained yourself .
and an explanation is , of course , out of the question .
yes , i do retain reading skills . shock .
i see you read the book .
yes , miss weathers , your name is embedded clearly between my ears .
i 'm on crowd patrol , miss weathers , excuse me .
i 've been trying to reach you but you have n't returned ...
miss weathers .
hello , dwight .
whatever .
hey , i got stuff to do . but i 'll find you later , okay .
humor me , sid .
dewey , there 's no such place .
the police are waiting outside . they 're going to take you somewhere safe .
no . this is nothing , dewey . i 'll be okay . go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence .
just in case ...
dewey , i 'm completely equipped with mace , alarm whistle , keyring , knife , a degree in defensive combat ...
do n't worry ...
you go , it 's all stairs , i can take it from here .
no . i will not crawl under a rock . this is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time . i 'll just get used to it .
look , sid , why do n't you take off ? disappear for a few days . i 'll come with you .
yeah , right .
as of now , they do n't see any relation . but they 're checking it out . the state , special task force , fbi -- they 're all here . they 'll find the guy .
it 's a copycat killer i knew this would happen . that fucking movie .
they do n't know . it was carefully planned . earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie .
oh my god . how could it happen ?
they thought it was a publicity stunt .
three hundred people watched ? nobody did anything ?
watch your back .
no , wait ...
no , gale , i 'm just getting started . seeya soon .
you 're getting obvious .
you are writing another book , are n't you ? that 's why you 're here . the story 's not over .
what do you mean ?
it 's what you want from me .
what do you want from me ?
stay away from the cop .
oh -- a god complex
i 'm everywhere .
where are you ?
you 're pretty when you 're angry .
what do you want ?
what if your life depended on it ?
i do n't play games .
that 's not the way we play the game .
who are you ?
i 'll give you one guess .
who is this ?
oh my god .
what ?
but who would operate your camera ?
sid , i 'll come with you .
my morn was a delta .
it 's good to see you involved .
it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas .
it seems to be causing a stir . what 's with the toilet paper ?
yeah , well ... you are the definition of mixed emotions . i really should hate you ... i see your movie 's getting good reviews .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm okay . people magazine wo n't stop calling but other than that ...
sidney . hello . how are you ?
the safety what ? fuck that !
stay under the safety light . help is on its way .
i dont know .
where is your attacker ?
yes , goddammit !
are you in danger now ?
someones trying to kill me . i need the police .
but i love you . and i want the whole world to know it .
you 're going to get it . you know what happens .
`` and iiiiiiiiiyeiiiii will always love you oooooowuoooooooo will always love you . ''
do n't do this .
`` if i should stay . i would only be in your way . so i 'll go . and yet , i know , i 'll think of you each step of the way ...
what ?
i got a surprise for you .
is sid in therapy ?
he tried to kill her first .
too bad .
sig ep 's got ta band , tonight .
shut up . mickey , you and i can take her late evening .
i have to watch rehearsal .
i have rehearsal .
i got . i got it . friday the 13th , part 20 .
lucas and his romper room stage .
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
oh , sid , youre sounding desparate . i guess fearing death makes one anxious .
it 's not a good idea , hallie .
i 'm the only one who can cut him down .
no , hallie , i 'm not gon na take you down too . i 'll be alright .
can i come with her ?
i 'd really just like to be alone .
it 's okay to break , girl . you shatter if you have to .
no , no , i had n't planned on going , it 's just mickey will be pissed .
no , hallie , not tonight . parties and mass murderers do n't go together . trust me .
we 're missing the sig ep party .
i 've got my entourage . take a break . please .
no , girletta , i do n't leave your side .
it 's okay . look , hallie , i 'll meet you outside .
who is that guy ?
yeah , right .
that was good .
i 'll cover you through rehearsal . derek when do you get outta docu- drama ?

what about rehearsal ?
please , i have the perfect excuse .
okay , you 're sure about skipping calculas ?
nah ... i think it 'll die off . it 's opening weekend . let 's see how it goes .
time to change numbers again ?
hello ? hello ?
knock yourself out .
the knife slices into maureen again ... then again . the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife . a horrifying , sickening sight .
the young girl is slashed again .
popcorn flies as maureen falls forward , into the aisle , clutching her bloody stomach . she 's speechless , unable to scream . she holds her bloody hand out for all to see , begging for help . she stumbles down the aisle . someone yells `` sit down . '' maureen turns to several people who begin to react . she turns behind her to see the ghost face coming at her again ... knife raised .
the young girl , clutching her bloody chest ... drags herself , crawling across wet grass ... the killer behind her ... raising his knife again .
maureen looks at phil , confused ... as if seeing for the first time ... it 's not phil . she pulls away when , the ghost-masked figure grabs her with one hand , the other one clutching the hunting knife . maureen sees it , her mouth billowing forth a loud scream that is matched by the entire audience as they scream at the screen .
the ghost advances on the young girl , grabbing her , pulling her to him , raising high a long , hunting knife . the young girl is helpless ...
everyone in the theater is screaming . maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie . she eats her popcorn .
the young girl runs by a window . she looks in . a ghost masked killer stares back . the figure crashes through the window attacking her . she fights him off , getting away , running ...
the crowd is really with the movie . some even talk to the screen . `` you dumb bitch . get out of the house . '' etc .
a patio chair comes flying through a glass door . the young girl in the movie tears off running , screaming , flying through the room .
it 's documented . most serial killers are attractive -- slightly off white males in their twenties .
easy black boy .
and white .
no , she killed her boyfriend . randy was a friend . mickey watch out , derek .
her old boyfriend ?
randy meeks . he was with sid that night in woodsboro .
is that cool ? just to leave her like that ?
i 've been waiting for you , baby .
i counted four .
how many guys they have on you ?
but ...
sid , i 'll seeya tonight .
guys , guys , i 'm sorry but , no way .
perfect . i 'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite .
thanks , joel .
i 'll stop by the deltas tonight .
you 're not allowed to ask that .
i got ta hit the library . anatomy . some of us have real majors . you gon na be okay , sid ?
this has nothing to do with me , joel . there 's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time . i ca n't control that . who 's hungry ?
have they questioned you yet , sid ?
i just love being a sister .
..harmonica style is okay .
..it 's really about family and tradition ...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex .
it 's all about sisterhood . everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but ...
we 've set you each at a five dollar quota .
ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece .
..this week 's tke kegger ...
gee , let me think . `` do you want to ... '' is that the best you can do ? some tired hand me down rehash ? hey , pal , no one 's gon na write a book about you . no movie rights . nothing . i 've been through this before and much better i might add .
do you want to die ?
closer than you think .
showgirls . absolutely frightening . what 's yours ? wait , let me guess . the house on sorority row ? final exam . graduation day ? the dorm that dripped blood ? splatter university ? am i close ?
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
what do you care ? let 'em have their fun . so , what 's up ?
but she 's standing right next to you .
she 's not here right now .
gale ?
hello ?
sandra started without us . we can stay . he kisses her again , then breaks away .
we can still sandra bullock it .
i just have a hard time with insipid , sexist violence .
you got ta go with it . scary movies are great foreplay .
i get scared really easy , okay .
come on , baby . lighten up a little , will ya ?
you are so not funny .
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry but i had to . it was too easy .
you ass .
i 'm gon na pee . you want anything ?
shush .
why does n't she just hang up and call the police ? stupid..
sssshhh . on screen the phone rings . the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook . she grabs it , running from the bathroom , into the living room , grabbing the phone .
now why does she have to be naked ? how does that serve the plot ?
now .
but ...
take it off .
we got free tickets .
if we hurry , we can still catch the sandra bullock movie .
it 'll be okay , baby , i 'll hold your hand .
i hate scary movies .
do n't panic .
what was that ?
where you going ?
i 'll be right back .
he 's after me .
what are you talking about ?
listen to me . we 've got to get help . the killer 's here .
sid ? jesus , where 's hallie ? i 've been here all night .
anytime . sorry it sucked . it just had that been there done that feeling .
thanks for the movie , randy .
i got ta coupla of those buttons myself .
i have this button i press . see ? it insulates me . she mimes an air lock valve .
i 'll relay it . you sure you do n't wan na go home ?
i guess gale 's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive .
if he 's innocent he 'll have an alibi .
me , too . randy . me too .
well , yeah ... she gave me a job . freelance . it got me outta woodsboro . i 'm sorry about cotton and yesterday . it was a bad idea . i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea . ah , shit , sid , i 'm fucked up . sidney looks at him long and hard , a smile slowly appearing .
do you work for her now ?
i 'm sorry , sid , please . i never should have gone along with gale . i know i 'm stupid . i wish i had some good reason to give you but i 'm just stupid . please , sid , do n't be mad at me .
what do you want ?
no , the other one . the one who played his wife .
melinda mcgraw ?
there 's always someone out there stalking actors . look at that woman from the commish .
and that cici chick was n't that bad either but i 'm really concerned about my safety now .
oh that 's right . those poor poor people . god ben damon was such a hottie .
nah i think it 's doing so damn well because one of it 's players got iced . i just hope none of us end up dead .
i think jeff bridges is getting tired .
heh heh i bet they are babe . i bet they are . look , my battery 's dying . . .
i did . hon , although i got a total of six minutes screen time , they 're the best six minutes of the movie .
oh i would n't miss it for the world . i bet you did such a great job .
all i 'm saying is i 'm gon na be royally p.o . 'd if you do n't catch my acting debut .
look , i 'm stuck on the freeway . i think there was some big accident . it could be a little while so i do n't want you to start freaking if i do n't get there at exactly , eight thirty .
no , jennifer love hewitt . of course it 's me , silly . and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself . where are you babe , the movie starts in twenty minutes .
reaction to what ?
to see your reaction .
alright i 'm here . what the fuck do you want from me ?
closer than you think .
where are you ?
very good . you follow directions well . now for the final part of the game . put down the bat and approach the sign , slowly .
yeah .
no ! you listen to me , if you 're not where i want you in fifteen minutes i 'll hollow her out . do you understand ?
i swear to god if you lay one hand on her !
you 're not playing by the rules ben . do n't you want her to live ?
good bye ben .
what ? !
that 's right . and you beat round 1. now we 're taking the game to a whole new level . meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes . i 'll have your girlfriend . we 'll be waiting .
what ? ! but i did everything you said to do !
very good . now we play round 2 .
it 's cici ! cici 's the name of the character she plays in the movie !
maybe so , but right now , we play the game . first question , your girlfriend 's counting on you , name your girlfriend 's character in stab 2 ?
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i 'll fucking kill you !
you seem to be familiar with the stab movies . here 's how we play . i ask you a question . you get it right , your girlfriend lives . you answer wrong , she dies .
what kind of a game ?
more of a game really .
listen you sick fuck , is this your idea of a joke ?
i mean , i 'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater . your girlfriend christine is in there . she 's all alone . everyone 's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start . i 've got my knife .
what do you mean ?
now let 's see you act your way out of this one .
thanks .
really ? you 're such a talented actor .
well ya got me . that 's me . i 'm ben damon .
you almost sound like that guy from there 's something about carrie . ben . ben damon .
but your voice sounds so familiar .
asshole , ca n't talk .
wait , wait . do n't hang up .
uh-huh . look bro , my battery is running out . really wish i could chat , but i ca n't so , later .
do i ?
i think you got the wrong number , buddy .
i do n't know .
well what number are you trying to reach ?
who is this ?
who is this ?
hello .
jesus . hello ?
horror flicks . b-movies from milton 's heyday .
what are these movies ? 'amazombies ' , 'space psychos ' 'creatures from thesan andreas fault ' ?
well you 'll find neither . rina reynolds , however , you will .
it may be maureen reynolds --
i know every face in here , respect for the unknown actor i suppose , myself included . if you 're looking for maureen prescott --
well if you wo n't work for me , will you work for the president ?
listen , i 'm busy . nobody has access to those files except studio execs . can you please go away now ?
well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you .
nope .
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you ?
i do n't watch tv and i hate books . whatta you need ?
i 'm gale weathers , author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders , and anchorwoman for total entertainment . maybe you 've heard of me ?
can i help you ?
alright , calm down . i 'm going to radio in for backup right now .
he killed milton ! the killer 's inside there ! oh god ! dewey ! dewey 's in there too ! he needs medical help ! he 's hurt !
jesus gale what happened ?
wrong , this issue is sidney prescott ! and either mr. riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her . so , where is she ?
boys , boys , why do n't we compare our gun calibers later ? the issue is maureen prescott !
actually , there was more this time . this time , we found a picture too .
ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab 3 ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott .
ben damon . christine perkins . sarah darling . tom prinze . that 's four , last time i learned how to count .
four ? there are five .
yeah , but , if i 'm not mistaken , you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before . she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother , and he was sent away for it ! maybe there is a third killer . sidney might know something
but we know who killed maureen prescott , billy loomis and stu macher . i mean , they even told sidney how they did it !
whoever it is , now is taking credit for maureen prescott 's murder .
deal , but i 'm still detective kincaid , ok ?
please , call me gale .
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers .
but you wo n't . you 're a good man detective . we think alike . i know you need my help . and i know you know i need your help .
i 'm not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers . you 're no longer working with the l.a.p.d . i do n't even know why you 're standing in here right now . by all means i should have you thrown out .
who ?
yes well we have a suspect , so do n't get that worried .
shit . sarah darling . i interviewed her too . god , it 's happening again is n't it detective ?
that 's stab 3 , miss weathers . it looks like we 're going to be getting a warrant to speak with miss prescott anyway .
look , miss weathers , if there 's a problem , give me a call . here 's my card . i 'm always there .
oh . i thought you wanted me to stick around .
i go to the police station and do my job , and you go back to being gale weathers .
alright kincaid , no where to ?
and who would that be ?
i 'd love to help , really i would n't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath , but i honestly do n't know where sidney is . after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth . the only other person that might know is , , not going to talk .
i 've tried to get in touch with sidney prescott , but she 's keeping herself very well hidden . you 're my one and only hope in finding her . her life may be in grave danger .
there 's more .
that 's sidney prescott 's mother .
a note ?
i wish that was all miss weathers , but there 's more . the killer left a note .
so is that why you 're here ? is that why you 're holding me from my show , to tell me about some brutal homicide i 'm not even involved in ?
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign . autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films .
well i interviewed damon once for the show . he was a real obnoxious fuck . any way , the second one , christine perkins , she had a part in stab 2 , did n't she ? she was playing cici .
i 'm sorry miss weathers . allow me to introduce myself , mark kincaid , l.a.p.d . are you familiar with the actor ben damon , or the actress christine perkins ?
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me .
catch him , or kill him .
oh yeah , how ?
because , that means that we 're dealing with an ordinary , flesh and blood killer . and i know how to handle guys like that .
how is that good news ?
here 's the deal , i 'm off to search the soundstage . that 's good news .
i used to think i had the perfect mom , perfect family . till i found out i was wrong . she had a secret life , and i tried to understand that , and soon as i thought i had , more secrets . i do n't ' know who my mom was . sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about my mother for the first time . you know , with tv and those movies and what not . god sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about myself for the first time . like i 'm watching my life instead of living in it .
what did you know about your mother ?
hmm .
ca n't arrest ghosts . but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people . you 're here , you 're not hiding , you 've done the right thing , miss prescott .
ghosts are tough , you ca n't shoot ghosts .
i know what it 's like to see ghosts that do n't go away . to be watching a scary movie in your head , whether you want to or not , watching it alone .
what do you mean ?
i 'm a homicide detective , remember ? when you see what i see day in and day out , the violence that people do to each other , you get haunted . i think you know about that .
excuse me ?
to me hollywood is about death .
must be exciting , beautiful place , beautiful people .
no , they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business . i grew up here , and i know my way around the studios .
did you request this case ?
all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one , all bets are off .
i 'll call you mark when you catch the killer , detective .
call me mark , would you ? cause i 'm gon na keep calling you sidney .
you seem to like movies , detective .
you mean like , movie trilogies ?
what do you know about trilogies ?
absolutely .
are you sure ?
why did n't you tell me ? this is my mother , dewey . why did n't you say something ?
the killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder , sidney . recently he 's also left a photo of your mother .
sid , get in my car . you 're coming back to the station with me where it 's safe .
and what made you think it was sidney ?
jesus christ sidney , what happened ? i got a call on my cell from home . they told me that someone was attacked .
no .
he could 've monitored the calls on a scanner . did you call her from the set ?
sidney , do you have any idea how he could 've gotten your number ?
what ? when ?
the killer called her .
nice to finally meet you , sidney .
there 's someone here who wants to help .
what rielly ?
detective kincaid ?
is that a threat ?
when it 's a threat , you 'll know it .
is that a threat , detective ?
well sid 's dad could n't help you and he was married to maureen .
who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter ?
what does this have to do with sid ?
before you jump to conclusions , the man in the picture , cotton weary , is out of the country on business . his alibi checks out . seems he 's got a tv show in australia , 100 % cotton . it 's supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious , but that 's besides the point .
police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .
what about angelina tyler ? she was there too .
that is for me to decide . i need to talk to her mr. riley , she is a key element in this case . i have a press conference in an hour , and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities .
i told you , i do n't know where sidney is . and even if there was a third killer , sidney does n't know about it .
understood . if you 'll excuse me detective . gale .
that 's fine mr. rielly , but if anyone else should die , i 'm going to have to get a warrant .
yeah . a real tragedy .
mr. rielly ? my name is mark kincaid . i 'm with the l.a.p.d . are you aware of last night 's events ?
he was n't superhuman dewey . he was n't superhuman at all .
watch out sid . randy said the killer 's always superhuman .
dewey ! it 's gale !
do n't worry sid i 'd never leave you like that .
dewey my god i thought you were dead .
sid i want you to stay here ! i 'll be right back ! i 'm not gon na let them get gale !
they 've got her !
where 's gale ?
i 'm out back . tied up . hurry sid ! the killer 's looking for you ! quick untie me !
where are you dewey ?
sid i can see you !
dewey ? ! ohmigod ! where are you ? !
help me sid ! the killer 's got me !
yeah ?
jesus christ dewey help me ! they tried to kill me in the bathroom ! the killers !
do n't worry , i 've got a permit for it .
no i 'll be ok. i 've got my mace . my knife . these two lethal weapons .
do you want me to come with you sid ? i mean , remember what randy said ?
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom .
no .
i can see nothing 's changed .
she was randy 's only girlfriend . . . ever .
karen colcheck . from woodsboro .
mm , what a waste of silicone . what does my mother have to do with this all dewey ? we 're a long way from woodsboro .
alright sid , over there is the stab 3 production offices . that 's where sarah darling was murdered last night .
listen , detective , i wan na see this studio where all this shit 's going down .
i was afraid they were bait , something to , ya know , trick you out of hiding .
follow me .
i figured i 'd be safe if i was at least up here with the people i care about . now where 's this kincaid guy the news is talking about ? i found this place from a fox 5 tv news report . heh .
what ?
well it 's not safe for me up there either . the killer found me dewey . he called me last night .
what are you doing here ? i told you to stay hidden ! it 's not safe for you up here .
sure , why not . you did save my life , mr . rielly .
gale , i know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again . the whole relationship thing .
who is it ?
paternity test results . christ dewey , you 're never going to believe who milton 's kid is .
nevermind , what 'd you two find ?
sidney , what happened ?
i work better alone . why do n't you do some snooping around the set ?
do you want us to come with you ?
i 've got an idea , i 'll hook up with you guys later .
just jennifer . and you .
has anyone else every used your phone ?
oh . yeah , i guess i do .
do you have her number stored in your memory ? phone memory !
sid , this is detective kincaid .
thank you .
gale behind you !
what ?
oh . oh god . gale --
amen boy scout , now answer the fucking door !
do n't worry . i 'm prepared for anything .
fuck !
gale , your engine 's still running .
neither are you , magnum p.i .
you 're not a detective .
i happen to work for the police god dammit !
stop following me .
i 'm on duty .
jennifer ? ! wait , where are you going off to ?
jennifer needs me .
and who is that ?
i 've got my suspicions but still , nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person .
right . sorry . do you think he did it ?
what part of 'off the record ' do n't you understand ?
i 'm sorry , this is too good !
i already removed it . i think someone on the film was trying to find sid , and that 's the only reason i came here . to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything .
someone stole sid 's file ?
the boys said no . she would n't give her name . a month later , the station gets broken into , the file room ransacked .
and ?
two months ago , the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'stab 3 ' . she wanted to see the file on sid , for research .
always .
off the record .
all of what dewey ? you do know something , do n't you ?
brace yourself , gale , all of this is actually not about you .
dewey , you 're not just here because of that second rate k-mart , straight-to-video version of me , are you ?
you used to say that was our strength .
it did n't work dewey . we tried , we 're different .
what 's wrong with just being gale weathers ? i liked her !
it was fucking '60 minutes ii ' ! i could n't say no ! i could 've been the next diane sawyer !
so it 's off to london for a week ? new york for a month ? l.a forever ?
you said you 'd never leave woodsboro , 'the only place that 's real ! ' but now you 're here . not with me . dewey , i took care of you . i waited until you were well . i could n't stay there , i mean , it 's like dog years , one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else .
what about me ?
again , i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders. ! what about you ?
why would the police come to you ?
yes . look , let 's get something straight dewey , i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me . not cause i 'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings .
do you really mean it this time gale ?
this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation 's attention to this shit anyway . i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na sit around and pass on the buck again .
you mean our past as in me and sid . this has nothing to do with you gale .
uh-huh . another news clipping . another one about sid 's mom . dewey , whether we like it or not it looks like we 're going to have to go back into our past .
they found another note ?
show him .
what so you can just exploit her again with another book ? sid does n't need you gale .
dewey , personal lives and pasts aside , this is about sidney . we need to know where she is .
when we did the first 'stab '' i realized i 'd known maureen prescott before , i mean as rina . i could n't tell anyone . can you imagine the press ?
but you know who she was .
what the hell are you guys getting at ? i make horror films , that 's what i do . the studio came to me with 'stab ' . they came to me , check it out .
i remember her ! she was a bit player in a couple of my movies . a nobody ! so what does it matter ?
no point , i 'm just gon na give detective kincaid a call .
what 's your point ?
just what the hell do you people think you 're doing , barging in here like this ? i 've got important calls to make . i run this studio .
so you knew sidney prescott 's mother .
sure .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
well if you were in my shoes , dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis , you 'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick .
your life ?
honestly , my life .
roman , from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way . honestly though , tell us , what's your favorite scary movie ?
well it 's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre . and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp , or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy , have no fear , roman is here . aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we 're going to pull off one of the best stabs yet .
it 's a pleasure to finally meet you , roman .
good morning gale . pleasure to be here .
do you get any of my witty humor ? i mean , you did play me for three movies . his two hands , dingus .
rob reiner and quentin tarentino ?
milton 's not a killer . he 's a pervert . he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends .
i think milton 's the killer . i think he just went out to kill another cast member .
settle down beavis . why do n't you tell us the truth ?
oh , come on ! you have made millions off the story of her murder . you 're obsessed with her and you 're obsessed with her daughter !
good twist .
nobody said she was an actor .
bitch .
oh i wish i got that one on tape . it 'd put a smile on my face everytime i 'm down .
look who 's talking moneybags . you got more homes than i do .
really , you know you 'd make a fascinating interview . lifestyles of the rich and psychotic .
basements creep me out .
gale weathers would find a way .
possibly .
there a story in that building ?
no really ?
need to get in that building ?
ha . maybe i should join snl .
that 's funny .
and as a sane person . for you that must be quite a stretch .
you know in the movies , i play you as being much smarter .
none .
here 's how i see it . i 've got no house , no movie , no gun , and i 'm being stalked . because someone wants to kill me ? no , because someone wants to kill you . so now , starting now , i go where you go . that way , if someone wants to kill me , i 'll be with you , and since they really want to kill you , they wo n't kill me , they 'll kill you . make sense ?
i am gale weathers !
being gale weathers . what the hell are you doing ?
what the hell are you doing ?
geez .
no ! he 's not dead ! he 's still breathing ! look !
god damn it you two ! run ! hurry ! he 's dead !
i dunno but i can tell you that your 's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass ! now come out and fight like a real man you pussy !
what 's your favorite scary movie gale ?
listen you sick bastard , what the fuck do you want ?
oh shit it 's my cell !
who 's phone ?
i do n't know . screw them . look , what 's important is that we stick together . no matter what . if anyone is next it 's you or me jen .
shit ! where the hell are tom and angelina ?
still that was a much better movie , i saw it at the premiere last week . god , what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for ? ! we 've got ta get down to business .
i know right . it was kinda weak . that 's cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it . the script was written by some new guy . he wrote arlington street .
and i die naked ? ! ugh ! this is complete bullshit . who wrote this piece of crap ?
wait a second , whoa ! calm down ! number one there were five different versions of the script given out . ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role . it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script . and what , i die in stab 3 ?
god damn you gale weathers ! do n't you see ? the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script ! ben damon 's character was the first one to get offed . so was his girlfriend - but she was n't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then sarah darling 's candy , and now me !
dewey , what the hell is she rambling about now ? what 's wrong jen , see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting ?
you ! how can i ever get any fame playing you !
i 'm saying things got out of hand . maybe they did take advantage of her ! . maybe the sad truth is , this is not the city for innocence . no charges were brought . and the bottom line is , rina reynolds would n't play by the rules . you wan na get ahead in hollywood , you got ta play the game , or go home .
are you saying she was-
it was in the 70 's , everything was different . i was well known for my parties , rina knew what they were . it was for girls like her to meet men , men who could get them parts , if they made the right impression . nothing happened to her that she did n't invite , in one way or another , no matter what she said afterwards .
well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv ? why do n't you start talking .
now you listen to me , lois lane , let it go . it 's dead and buried . daddy took ol ' yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago .
i do n't think so ! just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood ?
yeah .
just because you knew her ?
get real , that would make me a suspect !
and now ? i mean , murders on your set and still you say nothing ?
who ?
answer the question . you knew sidney 's mom ?
they 're the ones who approved it .
listen lois lane , i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because i 'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls . it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior 's attentions .
oh come on ! why the hostility ?
well then , i guess i 'll be leaving then .
gale weathers ? ! what are you doing here ? no press on the set ! no press , no press on set ! get that woman out of here .
excuse me detective , i think we have some business to attend to .
you mean what 's left of us . yeah i 'm running on empty anyways . got ta refuel .
i think we should go inside . i have to have a talk with the cast . all of you .
really , cause that stunt lost me the lead role in roman polanski 's latest picture . huh , what a coincide i was picked up by roman bridger . well , not exactly the roman i wanted . get my point ? stab 3 is bullshit . fuck , because of your big mouth i 'm here , drinking piss water scotch with second rate fucking celebrities like jennifer jollie and yourself ! hey , i just got an idea . maybe i should have a look at your break line . that your car over there ?
heh , well , that 's tv journalism for ya . stage the news to boost ratings .
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month . the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs , and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance would n't sky rocket .
tom prinze , tanked as usual . that 's a shocker .
gale weathers . what a surprise .
gale watchout !
let 's get out of here !
i know !
i know ! he killed kincaid !
gale he 's got dewey !
what are you talking about ?
we did some researching in the archives . sid , something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother 's murder . for two years of her life , 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth .
who 's this .
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me ! what are you doing here ?
oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? ''
what 'd he say ?
hi , gale . i 'm glad you 're all right .
oh my god ! sidney , you ran fast or what ? hey .
roman knock it off ! do you people even know why you kill people ? you kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason !
see sid , now comes the part where we get away with it ! the part where we win ! cause face it sidney , in this world , the bad guys win !
i ca n't take it anymore . this hollywood exploitation of the nightmare i lived has to be stopped . i did this to make you all repent for your sins , and now i 'm pleased i 've got my message across . good-bye .
wait a second sid . do n't you go jumping the gun . you have n't seen the best part . with the aides of the computer revolution of y2ki 've been able to steal your voice . ai n't it cool ? listen to what the police are gon na find next to your lifeless , mutilated body .
listen , i have no time for this . i 've heard this shit before ! so lets get on with it !
oh my god , angie crick ? from english class ?
i 'm a director sid , i direct . for example , angelina over there , she 's my partner . i can convince her to do anything . we 've been dating since i met her in woodsboro .
all the nightmares . all the hell i went through was because of you , you spineless bastard !
roman bridger , director . and brother . she slammed the door in my face , sid . said i was rina 's child and rina was dead . and it struck me , what a good idea ! so i watched her , made a little home movie , a little family film . seems maureen , mom , really got around . i mean , cotton weary was one thing , everybody knew about that , but billy 's father , that was the key ! your boyfriend did n't like seeing his daddy in my movies . did n't like it at all . and once i supplied the motive , all the kid needed was a few pointers . have a partner to sell out in case you get caught , find someone to frame , it was like her was making a movie .
my movie .
what ? what movie ?
it 's not just a new script , it 's a new movie .
has there been another goddamn rewrite ? how the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there 's a new script every 15 minutes ?
it is in my script .
roman that 's not the line .
it 's sarah .
i 'm hanging up right now .
but you know my favorite name ?
whatever . come on , who is this ? i think you have the wrong number .
why do n't we just read the scene ? candy , is that like candy cane or candy apple ?
this is candy . hang on , let me get some clothes . see ! i do n't ' understand why i have to start the scene in the shower ! the whole shower things been done , 'vertigo ' hello ! and i mean , my boyfriend just died , why am i showering ?
who 's this ?
who 's this ?
hello .
page 22.. ring ring . hello ?
page 22 , candy 's big moment .
huh , fine .
um hmm ... umhmm great , so let 's run the lines .
i 'm not happy that i 'm 35 playing a 21 year old . i 'm not happy that i have to die naked ! and i 'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend 's been cut into mcnuggets .
you 're not happy with your part .
what character ? i 'm candy , the chick who gets killed second . i 'm only in two scenes !
all right , since i got you on the phone , let 's talk about your character .
oh it 's no problem , i 'm just ... looking at your music video awards .
sarah , it 's roman , i 'm sorry i 'm running late , i 'm still on the 405 , i 'm about 10 minutes away .
oh shit . hello ? director 's office .
damn . he called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight .
no .
make-up . you need it . hey , roman is n't here ?
roman and everybody else went home for the night . i 'm here for a make-up test .
i 'm just saying , though . what if there 's someone out there stalking actors ? huh ? then what ?
would you give that script a rest ? it 's like a friggen umbilical cord to you .
scene 32. int . candy 's living room - night . `` what are you talking about ricky , the murders were a completely isolated incident '' .
what are you talking about ? the murders were a completely isolated incident .
and still the film is number one at the box office this weekend . beat out american pasty and arlington street .
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re-writes . it 's like every five minutes there 's a new script . god , and you just know this all because of stab 2 's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting .
it 's good to see you again sidney . i was growing real impatient . go ahead . explore . i 'll catch up with you later .
alright i 'm here , now show your face so we can finish this .
i thought you wanted me here ?
you 're doing real good . ca n't you figure it out ? i wan na finish this where it all began . woodsboro .
alright , i 'm here . now what ?
you follow directions good . now let 's wrap this production . go to the sunrise studios backlot . i 'll call you when you get there .
yeah ?
i 'll call you , when you 're on your way .
where ?
she 'd have been so happy , sidney , to know we 'd be together .
where ?
i do n't want them , i want you ! it 's simple . you show yourself , they survive , you run , they die !
you 're dead !
are real ? how do you know you 're not hearing things ? how do you know i 'm not someone in your head ? somewhere , you know .
how do i know their voices are --
always hard being friends with you , sidney . when you 're friends with sidney , you die ! well these friends do n't have to , sidney . it 's up to you .
go there .
yes .
do n't do it ! if you do one thing to attract attention , one thing , i 'll kill them both . now , do you have somewhere we can be alone ?
the question is n't who i am . the question is , who 's with me .
who is this ?
{ a click } i only her you too , sidney .
great . a spirited one . i 'll be seeing you real soon sidney . real soon .
if you lay a hand on him i 'll fucking kill you !
no . we play in my court this time . come to hollywood . stab 3 's going to cutting corners cast-wise . and i 've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named dewey rielly .
the final act ? well let 's play asshole !
heh . so you think sidney . so you think . it 's all been building up to this sid . every stab . every scream . every ounce of blood that 's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment . welcome tothe final act .
no . you did n't kill my mother . billy loomis and stu macher did .
let them try . you 'll never find me . i 've already gotten away with murder before . for instance , maureen prescott .
you sick fuck i 'm tracing this call as we speak ! the police are gon na nail your ass !
i want to finish what i started . i want to finish the game .
w-what do you want ?
do you think it 's over sidney ? do you ?
it 's mother , sidney , now be a good girl and turn on the news . do it !
who the fuck is this ?
do n't you want to know how you can help , sidney ? are you listening to me , huh ?
i 'm sorry , your voice .
no i need to call you . just you .
well then the people you need to call are the police .
uh-huh i 'm sure . i 've killed someone ! oh my god i 've actually killed someone !
are you sure ?
laura i think i just killed somebody .
yes , hi i 'm laura , i 'm a trained counselor . how can i help you .
hello ?
i ca n't ... i 'm bad off , billy . you cut too deep .
find her you dipshit !
where the fuck did she go ?
i do n't know billy but i 'm hurtin ' .
odds are -- she 'll miss anyway .
she ca n't get both of us .
she looked dead . still does .
i thought she was dead .
no , it 's not .
it 's on the table .
get the gun . i 'll untie pops .
that 's it , billy . i ca n't take any more . i 'm feeling woozy .
everyone dies but us . we get to carry on and plan the sequel . let 's face it , these days -- you got ta have a sequel .
and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head . it 's a perfect ending .
except for me and billy ... we were left for dead ...
what if your father snapped ? your mom 's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree , killing everyone ...
yeah ...
ready ?
you know what time it is , sid ? it 's after midnight . it 's your mother 's anniversary . we killed her exactly one year ago today .
this is the best part , sid . billy 's got it all figured out . why do you think we kept your father alive so long ? why did we save you for last ?
that 's right and now that you 're no longer a virgin . you got ta die -- those are the rules .
think about it . on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years , do n't you think ? . you took my mother , so i took yours . big sympathy factor . maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior . it certainly fucked you up . it made you have sex with a psychopath .
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people ? do n't think so . you see , it 's scarier when there 's no motive , sid .
nope .
yeah , we just watched a few movies . took a few notes . it was fun .
tell that to cotton weary . you would n't believe how easy it was to frame him .
and if you get it right -- you die .
it 's an easy game . we ask you a question . if you get it wrong -- you die .
you have to play , sid . do n't want to disappoint your dad . he 's been waiting around all night .
oh yeah .
where ya going ? it 's not over yet . we 've got one more surprise -- stu , i believe it 's your turn .
i was hoping sid and i could talk .
dude . what are you doing here ?
you know it .
you ready to party hard tonight ?
oh ...
because i 'm trying to build your self-esteem . you 're far too sensitive .
i was just asking . why are you always at me ?
duh ... that 's quick .
so you gon na try and make up with sid ?
thanks , butt wart . you did good .
piece of cake . she 'll be there .
how 'd you do ?
sorry .
you open your mouth and stupidity pours out .
owwww ...
no one 's saying you did .
i did n't kill anybody .
sorry .
it 's called tact , you fuckrag .
what ? she asked .
we 're gon na have to keep you , billy . the governor 's got sbi , fbi , and god knows who else on their way down here .
no , i did n't . i did n't kill anyone , sheriff .
did you ride past casey becker 's house ?
and last night ? sidney said you crawled through her window last night too ?
yes , sir .
you rode your bike out there ?
i just wanted to see her , that 's all .
thank you , hank . we 're on it . what were you doing out at sidney 's tonight ?
got ta find me first , you pansy-assed mama 's boy .
i 'm gon na rip you up bitch . just like your slut whore mother .
not so fast . we 're gon na play a little game . it 's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass ?
you bitch -- where the fuck are you ?
are you alone in the house ?
hello ?
got the ending figured out yet ? time 's running out .
stop it !
jesus ... fuck , that hurt .
we did your mom a favor , sid . the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something .
i do n't understand ...
why ? why ? did you hear that , stu ? i think she wants a motive . hmmm ... i do n't really believe in motives , sid . i mean , did norman bates have a motive ?
why did you kill my mother ?
we already played that game . you lost , remember ?
fuck you .
it 's called guess how i 'm going to die !
it 's okay . give me the gun .
no ! do n't believe him .
i 'm alright . got ta ... get ... help .
i thought you were ...
no , but if it were you , that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track . using your one phone call to call me so i would n't think it was you .
you do n't still think it was me ?
uh-huh .
yeah ... and when i called no one answered .
no , sheriff burke called your dad . i saw him .
i called my dad .
when you 're arrested -- you 're allowed one phone call ? who did you call ?
what ?
who did you call ?
yeah ... i think so .
are you serious ?
you heard me .
what ?
or even a good porno .
sshh ... it 's okay .
ssshh ... everything 's gon na be okay . i promise .
i wan na let go . i do ...
sure it is , sid . it 's all a movie . life 's one great big movie . only you ca n't pick your genre .
but this is life . this is n't a movie .
sure it does . it 's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father .
everytime i get close to you i see my mom . i know it does n't make sense .
oh sidney ...
i think in some weird analytical , psychological bullshit way i 'm scared i 'm gon na turn out just like her , you know ? like the bad seed or something ...
but you 're right -- enough is enough . i ca n't wallow in the grief process forever and i ca n't keep lying to myself about who my mom was .
you lost your mom ...
no , billy . i 'm the one who 's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress .
so ... i 'm sorry . i 've been a selfish shit and i 'm sorry .
so ...
it 's okay . we need to talk .
subtlety , stu . look it up .
you have to move on , sid .
your parents split up . it 's not the same thing . your mom left town , she 's not in a coffin somewhere .
when are you gon na let that go , sid ? when my mom left my dad -- i just accepted it . this is the way it is . she 's not coming back .
tomorrow . one year tomorrow .
it 's been a year since she died .
no , it 's me , billy . i need time . i 'm still adjusting to my mom .
is it the sex thing ? am i being too pushy ?
no ...
then what is it ? is there somebody else ?
you know that 's not true .
understand what ? that i got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me .
i 'm so sorry ... please understand .
see , it could n't have been me . i was in jail , remember ?
i know . he called again last night at tatum 's house .
the police say i scared him off . it was n't me , sid .
no ... i do n't ... it 's just ... oh god , billy , someone was there , someone tried to kill me .
hey , hey , it 's just me .
jesus , shit !
he 's here . he 's trying to kill me ...
i heard screaming . the door was locked . are you okay ...
oh billy ... please ... god ...
what 's that ?
would you settle for a pg-13 relationship ?
i 'm going ... i 'm going .
you know what my dad will do to you ?
no , no . i would n't dream of breaking your underwear rule . i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff .
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump .
yeah , it was edited for tv . all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago , we started off kinda hot and heavy , a nice solid `` r '' rating on our way to an nc17 . and how things have changed and , lately , we 're just sot of ... edited for television .
oh it did ?
and i was home , bored , watching television , the exorcist was on and it got me thinking of you .
now that it 's out of your system .
it just occurred to me that i 've never snuck through your bedroom window .
what are you doing here ?
close call .
i 'll only stay a sec .
my dad 's in the other room .
you sleep in that ?
what are you doing here ?
i 'm sorry . do n't hate me .
billy ? what the ...
your call .
do n't make me ... i ca n't ... i wo n't .
there are two doors to your house . a front door and a back one . if you answer correctly -- you live .
what ?
what door am i at ?
answer the question and i will .
... leave me alone ... please ...
lucky , for you there 's a bonus round . but poor steve ... i 'm afraid ... he 's out .
you tricked me ...
then you should know jason 's mother -- mrs. vorhees was the original killer . jason did n't show up until the sequel .
it was jason . i saw that goddamned movie twenty times . it was jason .
afraid not .
no it 's not . it was jason .
i 'm sorry . that 's the wrong answer .
name the killer in friday the 13th .
... please ... no ...
then answer the question . same category .
please go away ! leave us alone !
but you 're doing so well .
noooo ... .
now for the real question .

that all depends on you .
please do n't hurt him .
guess .
where are you ?
go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again .
how do you know his name ?
his name would n't be steve , would it ?
so you better leave .
i believe you ...
i 'm telling you the truth . i lied before ...
i 'm getting scared .
i swear it . and he 's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you .
sure ...
i lied . i do have a boyfriend and he 'll be here any second and your ass better be gone .
i thought you did n't have a boyfriend .
my boyfriend will be here any second and he 'll be pissed when i tell him ...
or else what ?
look , enough is enough . you had your fun now you better leave me alone or else .
to see what your insides look like .
what do you want ?
they 'd never make it in time .
i 'm two seconds from calling the police .
more of a game , really .
is this some kind of a joke ?
no , you listen , you little bitch . if you hang up on me again i 'll gut you like a fish . understand ?
listen , asshole ...
no-bored .

i told you not to hang up on me .

do n't hang up on me .
nah , i do n't think so ...
wait ... i thought we were gon na go out .
i have to go now .
what do you think i said ?
that 's not what you said .
i want to now who i 'm talking to .
what did you say ?
because i want to know who i 'm looking at .
why do you want to know my name ?
you never told me your name .
no .
maybe . do you have a boyfriend ?
why ? you wan na ask me out ?
so , you got ta boyfriend ?
the first one was , but the rest sucked .
freddy -- that 's right . i liked that movie . it was scary .
yeah ... freddy krueger .
is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers ?
uh ... nightmare on elm street .
guess .
uh ... halloween . you know , the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters . what 's yours ?
you have to have a favorite .
i do n't know .
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
uh-huh .
do you like scary movies ?
just some scary movie .
really ? what ?
i 'm getting ready to watch a video .
i only eat popcorn at the movies .
uh-huh .
you 're making popcorn ?
popcorn .
what 's that noise ?
i do n't think so .
you tell me your name , i 'll tell you mine .
who is this ?
why do n't you want to talk to me ?
hello .
they 've got 900 numbers for that . seeya .
i want to talk to you for a second .
what ?
wait , wait , do n't hang up .
you 're forgiven . bye now .
to apologize .
so why did you dial it again ?
i 'm sorry . i guess i dialed the wrong number .
hello .
it happens . take it easy .
do i ?
i think you have the wrong number .
i do n't know .
what number are you trying to reach ?
what number is this ?
who are you trying to reach ?
who is this ?
yes .
i 'll get my camera .
i 'll call for backup .
we got ta get back . jesus . he 's here . what the fuck is he doing here ?
sidney 's father ?
shit . it 's neil prescott 's car .
i do n't think you 're so bad .
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism .
what about gale weathers ? i sound like a meteorologist ...
nah ... it 's just this town 's way of not taking me serious .
i like it . it 's ... sexy .
dwight . dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago .
so is dewey your real name ?
no ! i mean ... i should probably take just you .
can i bring kenny ?
ma'am , i am the deputy of this town .
i 'd love to . if you 're sure it 's alright ?
a car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road .
what kind of lead ?
sheriff just radioed me . i 'm gon na check out a possible lead . thought you might like to join me .
mind if i join you ?
keeping an eye on things . checking the place out .
then what are you doing here ?
not much story here . just a bunch of kids cutting loose .
you never know when or where a story will break .
what brings you out to these parts ?
deputy ... good evening .
evening , ma'am .
you are precious . please , call me gale .
i just turned 25. i was 24 for a whole year .
that 's quite alright . if i may say so , ma'am , you 're much prettier in person .
am i keeping you ? i 'm sorry .
if you 'll excuse me , ma'am .
we have n't ruled out that possibil ...
he 's not a suspect , is he ?
no , not yet .
really ? you small town guys are good . and have you located sidney 's father ?
we 're tracking the cellular phone bill .
well , we can hope , ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask , a cellular phone -- not much there .
serial killer is not really accurate , ma'am . the killer has yet to strike twice .
boy , you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer .
twenty-five , huh ? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males , 11-24. i just missed you . of course , you do n't look a day over twelve , except in the upper torso area . does the force require that you work out ?
i 'm twenty-five years old , ma'am .
i know , i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew ? please , call me gale . you look awfully young to be a police officer .
you 're not supposed to be here , ma'am .
and why is that ? has something happened ?
well ... uh ... yes ma'am . for the time being .
productive . so they 're closing down the school ?
i know who you are , ma'am . how 's the eye ?
hi ! gale weathers . field correspondent , inside story .
she 's with me . i just wanted to check on things .
what is she doing here ?
shit .
sorry , police orders . i 'll stay out of the way , i promise .
no , dewey . you 'll ruin the whole night .
do n't be so self-righteous . it 's just a little blow out -- we 'll be perfectly safe .
a party ? mom 's gon na kill you . then me .
i 'm sorry , deputy dewey-boy but we 're ready to go .
what did mama tell you ? when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law .
hold up a sec ...
hey ... dewey . can we go now ?
yes , you doofus .
does mom know ?
you ca n't be here , tatum . this is an official crime scene .
oh , god , sid , i 'm sorry i was late .
what are you doing here ?
not yet .
should i be worried ?
afraid not .
have they found my father ?
looks like i 'm your personal bodyguard tonight , sid .
yeah .
you girls ready .
thanks , dewey . but with my luck they 'd cast tori spelling .
i see you as a young meg ryan myself .
hey , i saw that movie . true story , 'bout some killer in texas .
god , look at this place , it 's the town that dreaded sundown .
and my dad ? any word on him ?
i know . we 're checking every cellular account in the county . any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross-referenced . it 's gon na take time but we 'll find him .
somebody called me , dewey . i 'm not making it up .
billy was released . his cellular bill was clean . he did n't make those calls .
not yet , but we 're looking . if you need anything ...
any word on my dad ?
we 'll find him , sid . do n't worry .
i do n't know . i guess .
he 's not registered . could he have gone to another hotel ?
at the airport .
you 're sure it was the hilton ?
did you reach my dad ?
... yeah ...
you gon na be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit ?
yes , sir .
watch her . do n't let on -- just keep your eyes out .
she 'll be with her friends over at stu maker 's tonight .
hold off for now . just stay close to her .
she 's with my sister . should i bring her in ?
he 'd have to be crazy . where 's sidney ?
you think he could still be in town ?
they believe he 's out of state by now . we 'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night . if he 's not picked up by morning -- we 'll do a house to house .
have you contacted the bureau ?
there 's more . guess what tomorrow is ? the anniversary of his wife 's death . it all fits . he 's our man .
could n't his cellular number have been cloned ?
listen up , dewey , because it 's bad . real bad . aircomp just faxed us . the calls were listed to neil prescott -- sidney 's father . he made the calls with his cellular phone . it 's confirmed .
keeping my eye on sidney .
dewey ! where the hell you been , boy ?
yes , sir , sheriff .
she 's okay . looks like some boys were teasing her . himbry 's shutting down the school though . i want you to take look around .
we have n't located her dad yet .
she staying with you ?
twenty years ago i woulda said not a chance . but these kids today ... damn if i know .
they 're pulling loomis ' account . but it 'll be morning before we see something . you think he did it ?
what about the cellular phone bill ?
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger 's and walmart . neither of which keep purchase records .
have to be . the shit she 's gone through .
she 's tough .
how is she ?
drive by patrol .
what were you doing out here ?
i was first to respond .
he 's her boyfriend .
hank loomis ' kid ? aw ... jesus ...
we got him , sheriff . billy loomis .
how is everything ?
it 's deputy riley today , sid .
not my daughter ... not my ...
casey ! casey !
i can hear her . oh mother of god , i can hear her .
where is she ?
the phone 's dead .
casey ? where are you honey ? call the police , goddamnit .
call the police .
where is she ?
casey ? casey ?
what is it ? where 's casey ?
jesus ...
i told you to send it back .
that fish smelled strong .
as long as it records i do n't give a shit . we 're not doing a remote .
about thirty seconds .
what 's the delay ?
the control board 's glitched . you know we ca n't carry a live picture .
prep the compact , we 'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight 's festivities .
what 's the plan ?
not this time . i owe cotton that much . hell , even i thought that man was guilty .
but it 's so much easier when we make it up .
if i 'm gon na blow this up -- i need hard proof .
when did that ever stop you ? you ca n't sit on this . this is huge .
no , not so fast . we have nothing concrete .
you want to go live ?
jesus christ ! an innocent man on death row . a killer still on the loose . kenny , tell me i 'm dreaming .
jesus ! the camera-hurry !
what ? what ?
but could n't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat ? the same person who planted it in cotton 's car , framing him ? the same person who really killed your mother ?
i saw him leaving wearing it .
he was drunk that night . he left his coat at your house , after your mother seduced him ...
he 's lying . she would n't have touched him . he raped her , then butchered her . her blood was all over his coat .
not one word . he admits to having sex with your mother but that 's all .
has his story changed ?
many times .
have you talked to cotton ?
i think you falsely identified him . yes .
during the trial , you did all those stories about me . you called me a liar .
he was convicted in a court of law . your testimony put him away . it does n't matter what i think .
do you still think he 's innocent ?
what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . cotton weary is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that .
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories .
your mother 's murder was last year 's hottest court case . somebody was gon na write a book about it .
you owe my mother .
i owe you shit .
please . you owe me .
forget it .
off the record . no cameras .
kenny . camera . now .
i want to talk to you .
just stay back .
i 'm not here to fight .
i 'll send you a copy .
i 'll look for it .
it 'll be out later this year .
how 's the book ?
yes , that 's right .
it 's okay , tatum . she 's just doing her job . right , gale ?
ricki lake .
where do you get this shit ?
and it fucked her up royally . think about it . it makes perfect sense . her mom 's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world , she 's disillusioned , where 's god , etc . completely suicidal . and one day she snaps . she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year . and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression .
cut some slack . she watched her mom get butchered .
please , it 's common knowledge . her mother was a trollop .
you 're evil .
maybe she 's a slut just like her mom .
why would sidney want to be with steve ? she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy .
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage .
and why would she do that ?
what if she did it ? what if sidney killed casey and steve ?
for attention . the girl has some serious issues .
why would she lie about it ?
she was never attacked . i think she made it all up .
who are you ?
looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again .
leavemealone !
poor billy-boyfriend . an innocent guy does n't stand a chance with you .
hello sidney .
hello ?
if you hang up , you 'll die just like your mother .
good try , randy . tell tatum to hurry . bye now .
what am i doing ?
uh-huh .
can you see me right now ?
right here .
so where are you ?
that 's the original part .
why would you call me from my front porch ?
your front porch .
so where are you ?
the question is not who am i. the question is where am i ?
so who are you ?
maybe that 's because i 'm not randy .
that is so unoriginal . you disappoint me , randy .
are you alone in the house ?
because they 're all the same . it 's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who ca n't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door . they 're ridiculous .
and why is that ?
do n't start . you know i do n't watch that shit .
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
i like that thing you 're doing with your voice , randy . it 's sexy .
do you like scary movies , sidney ?
aha , randy , you gave yourself away . are you calling from work ? tatum 's on her way over .
scary night , is n't it ? with the murders and all , it 's like right out of a horror movie or something .
i have no idea .
sleep tight , sweetie .
have a good trip .
got it .
... so call if you need me .
... out at the airport ...
no ? oh , well ... i 'm hitting the sack . my flight leaves first thing in the morning . now the expo runs all weekend so i wo n't be back til sunday . there 's cash on the table and i 'll be staying at the raleigh hilton ...
no you did n't .
i heard screaming .
can you knock ?
are you okay ?
twice .
i thought blockbuster fired you .
working , thank you .
fuck you , nut case . where were you last night ?
oooooh ... before or after he sliced and diced .
stu was with me last night .
you got it .
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie .
listen to me , sid . i found tatum . she 's dead , she 's been killed ... i think stu did it .
do n't come any closer .
do n't shoot . it 's me .
stop . right there .
she 's the scream queen .
the fog , terror train , prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies ?
no , sid .
come on , sid . give me the gun .
do n't listen to him . it 's him . he 's the one .
his movie nut mind has snapped , sid . he 's gone psycho .
i 'll be right back .
yeah .
wan na another beer ?
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie . for instance : 1. you can never have sex . the minute you get a little nookie -- you 're as good as gone . sex always equals death . 2. never drink or do drugs . the sin factor . it 's an extension of number one . and 3. never , ever , ever , under any circumstances , say `` i 'll be right back . ''
not until trading places in '83 . jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies . she did n't show her tits until she went legit .
i wan na see jamie lee 's breasts . when do we see jamie lee 's breasts ?
like you had one .
there goes my chance with sid .
he came to make up .
what 's leatherface doing here ?
i can cry on cue .
we could be like two grief stricken students and we 'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly .
i had 'em hid in the foreign section .
i thought everything was checked out .
it 's 1995 -- motives are incidental .
and what would be your motive ?
you 're absolutely right . i 'm the first to admit it . if this were a scary movie , i 'd be the prime suspect .
so while they 're off investigating a dead end , billy , who 's been written off as a suspect , is busy planning his next hunting expedition .
which is you ...
because he 's probably dead . his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere ... eyes gauged . see , the police are always off track with this shit , if they 'd watch prom night they 'd save time . there 's formula to it . a very simple one . everyone 's always a suspect -- the father , the principal , the town derelict ...
i think her father did it . how come they ca n't find his ass ?
could be . now that billy 's tried to mutilate her , you think sid would go out with me ?
she 's saving herself for you .
maybe sidney would n't have sex with him .
so what 's his reason ?
there 's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend . that 's the beauty of it all . simplicity . besides , if it 's too complicated you lose your target audience .
why would he want to kill his own girlfriend ?
because , obviously they do n't watch enough movies . this is standard horror movie stuff . prom night revisited .
the why 'd the police let him go ?
you 're such a little lap dog . he 's got killer printed all over his forehead .
it was all a misunderstanding . he did n't do anything .
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section ?
what ?
yeah , i 'm off early -- curfew you know . now that 's poor taste .
you coming tonight ?
we had a run in the mass murder section .
jesus , this place is packed .
did you really put her liver in the mailbox ? i hear they found her liver in the mailbox .
i 'm gon na gut your ass in a second .
besides -- `` takes a man to do something like that . ''
it would certainly improve your high school q .
what are you saying ? that i killed her or something ?
and are the police aware you dated the victim ?
before she dumped him for steve .
for about two seconds .
yeah , casey and steve were completely hollowed out . takes a man to do something like that .
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same .
peer pressure ... i 'm way to sensitive .
so stu , what 's your motive ? billy 's got one . the police are on their way . what are you going to tell them ?
you 'll never get away with this .
the official term is `` psychotic '' .
you 're crazy -- both of you .
it 's all part of the game .
why are you doing this ?
guess , i wo n't be needing this anymore .
you guys can go up to my parents room ? to talk and ... whatever .
if tatum sees you -- she 'll draw blood .
cool . see you guys tonight . bring food .
yeah , okay ... whatever .
remember , there 's safety in numbers .
my parents are out of town . it 'll be like my hurricane bash last year . nothing extreme . just a few of us , hangin ' .
are you serious ?
and to celebrate this impromptu fall break , i propose we have a party . tonight , my house .
are you kidding ? this is like christmas .
why are they doing this ?
hey , stu ? did n't you use to date casey ?
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .
deal .
there 's that sense of humor . i knew it still existed . ohh , sid , let 's have some fun tonight .
oh , sidney . what ? a guy can talk tits til he 's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie . watch out .
tatum !
watch the show , sid . his basket is bigger than the one you 're pushing .
what secret meaning ? like a satanical thing ?
grant wrote the song himself . i 'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning , `` eight is enough ... ''
no way .
during foreplay , i sing the theme song to myself . `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' it 's a real turn on .
how does that get you in the mood with stu ?
grant goodeve -- the oldest brother on eight is enough . remember that show ? he was the one who lived off alone . he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge . god , i was in love with grant , he was so hot . the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years . grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman .
who ?
with stu , there 's little time to stop and reflect . but sometimes before , to relax and get in the mood , i think about grant goodeve .
what do you think about when you 're having sex ?
billy and his penis do n't deserve you .
but he 's been so patient with me , tatum . you know , with all the sex stuff . how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who 's sexually anorexic ?
you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother 's untimely death . it 's no big deal . you 'll thaw out .
billy 's right . whenever he touches me , i just ca n't relax .
he better not be . i told stu to keep his mouth shut . i think we can live without everybody 's all american for one night .
is billy going to be there tonight ?
oh , god ...
hey , sid . just think if they make a movie about you . who 's gon na play you ?
come on , let 's rock .
you 're right . i 'm cracking up . ignore me .
do n't go there , sid . you 're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick . do n't freak yourself out -- we 've got a long night ahead of us .
if i was wrong cotton , then he 's still out there .
well ... you can only hear that richard gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it .
and you believe it ?
it goes further back , sid . there 's been talk about other men .
created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers .
you ca n't prove a rumor . that 's why it 's a rumor .
if they were having an affair how come that cotton could n't prove it in court ?
i did n't say that , sid . but you know there were rumors . your dad was always out of town on business . maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman .
so you think my mom was a slut too ?
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth . maybe he was having an affair with your mom .
come on . pathos has it 's perks .
i do n't know ...
this could be good . what do you think , sid ?
it was him , tatum . i know it .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .
just ignore him . you had good reason to think what you did .
i bet he 's pissed .
shit , what is he doing here ?
i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ?
this is a mistake . i should n't be here .
but if it was n't billy it could be anybody . he could be here at school right now .
just relax . you 're at school now . no one can get you here .
just a sec ... i need to talk to someone .
come on , sid .
it 's alright . i 'll get it .
take a message .
i knew this guy was too perfect . he was destined to have a flaw .
he was there , tatum .
do you really think billy did it ?
no , nothing 's like it used to be .
just like old times , ai n't it ?
just another sleepover at the riley 's .
her dad 's out of town . she 's staying with us .
it 's okay . she was supposed to pick me up .
bye .
whatever . just hurry .
good , 'cause i wan na swing by blockbuster and get us a video . i was thinkin ' tom cruise in all the right moves . you know , if you pause it just right you can see his penis .
i 'm not worried .
do n't worry . casey and steve did n't bite it til way after ten .
it 's past seven .
practice ran late . i 'm on my way .
later .
thanks , tatum .
i 'll be there by seven . i promise
uh-huh , it 's just ... you know , the police and reporters ... it brings it all back .
yeah , yeah ... are you okay ?
tell your mom i said thanks .
no prob . i 'll pick you up after practice .
you sure i can stay over ? my dad wo n't be back til sunday .
how do you gut someone ?
or a man 's mentality .
they do n't know . dewey said this is the worst crime they 've ever seen . even worse than ... well it 's bad . they 're bringing in the feds . this is big .
they think it 's school-related ?
fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school . teachers , students , staff , janitors ...
do they know who did it ?
not anymore . her parents found her hanging from a tree . her insides on the outside .
casey becker ? she sits next to me in english .
and not just killed , sid . we 're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end .
no way .
oh god ! you do n't know ? casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night .
what happened ?
do you believe this shit ?
hey , guess who 's here ? it 's that chick from inside story ?
what am i ? the beer wench ?
i got it . tatum get me a beer . they 're in the fridge in the garage .
tits -- see .
with that set of lungs -- she should be .
where you guys been ? we had to start without you .
that 's mature .
okay , but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you .
for once , stu , drop it .
is this not cool or what ? hey , sid , what happened ?
hey , go easy , tatum . he did n't do it .
you know if i were accused of carving up two people , i 'd take the opportunity to skip school .
i did . he 's full of shit .
i thought you dumped her for me .
that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct .
because there 's no way a girl could have killed them .
i do n't know , they just did .
hunt ? why would they ask if you like to hunt ?
i 'm in .
what do you think ?
ease back , mills .
how is it working for a scumbag like this ? you proud of yourself ?
you 're wound too tight , mills . let it go .
he 's pissing in our faces again and we 're just taking it .
he would n't just turn himself in . it does n't make any sense .
you do n't . it goes to court now .
so far it 's all dead ends . no credit history . no employment history . his bank account 's only five years old and it started as cash . we 're even trying to trace his furniture , but for now all we know is he 's independently wealth , well educated and totally insane . we may never know how he got that way .
what about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? there must be something to connect him with a past .
he cuts off the skin if his fingertips . that 's why we ca n't find a single usable print in the apartment . he 's been doing it for quite a while . keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back .
go start picking up the pieces . we 'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner .
thank you .
that 's not necessary . you 're in .
there 's nothing that says i have to work with him . if somerset wants out , `` goodbye . '' give it to me .
how 's that ?
give it to me .
i do n't have anyone else to give this to , somerset , you know that . and nobody 's going to swap with you .
i 'll see you .
i guess ... decide for yourself . i do n't know what it says . i 'm going to go .
i read about it in the paper .
he 's being arraigned tomorrow .
it would be too hard .
they 're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go , but i told them not to expect it .
yeah , that 's true .
we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house .
thank you . tell them , thank you .
i can breathe withour pain now , so i guess i feel great .
how you feeling ?
he 's not finished .
well , there he sits . it 's not supposed to make sense .
really ?
it 's always been like this .
i have no understanding of this place anymore .
i heard .
did you read in the paper today , about the man who was walking his dog ? he was attacked , and his wallet and his watch were taken . and then , while he was still lying unconscious , his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes . it happened four blocks from here .
you know .
what are you talking about ?
ca n't you feel it yet ? ca n't you feel that feeling ... ? you 're not going to be a cop anymore .
i 'll get a job , maybe on a farm . i 'll work on the house .
come on . what are you going to do with yourself out there ?
good .
yeah .
i 'm sure everyone 's doing their best .
i thought you might want to be filled in .
it 's none of my business anymore .
greed . it was written in blood .
already .
there was a second .
no , i have n't heard .
have you heard ?
everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible . also ... this should n't be his first assignment .
you 've left unfinished business before .
i know what you 're thinking , okay ? you do n't want to get in bed with this every night , but it 's different now . you 're retiring . in six days you 're all the way gone .
this ca n't be my last duty here . it will go on and on .
what 's this : `` i 'm declining this case ? '' it do n't work that way .
one is gluttony .
hey , so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins . but , this was a fat guy . the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him . and , writing on the walls happens all the time . it 's like the fashionable thing to do .
... envy , sloth , pride and lust . seven .
so what ? this victim ...
there are seven deadly sins . gluttony , wrath , greed ...
announcing what ?
`` dear detectives , long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . '' it 's the murderer 's way of announcing himself .
he had a gun . he had a gun ... and he made it happen . he made me do it ! he made me put that ... that thing on . oh , christ ! he made me wear it ... and ... and he told me to fuck her . he had the gun in my mouth .
who tied her down ? you or him ?
she was ... she was on the bed . she was just sitting on the bed .
where was the prostitute ? where was she ?
what ? what ?
where was the girl ?
and ... and ... and he said ... he asked me if i was married . and , i could see he had a gun in his hand .
okay ...
put it down . put it on the ground .
this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here . he wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock .
i 'm ... i 'm just delivering a package .
who are you ? what are you doing out here ?
what the hell 's going on ?
turn around . hands on your head !
jesus christ , man , do n't shoot me !
no !
you did n't know .
her pretty head .
give me the gun .
i visited your home this morning , after you left .
david ... please ...
it 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct .
why ?
what time is it ?
it 's not too far away now .
what 's so exciting ?
it does n't matter who i am . who i am means absolutely nothing . you need to turn left here ... at the traffic light .
i mean , at this point , what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself ?
what do you mean ?
hello .
i do n't believe it .
because i envy your normal life . envy is my sin .
somerset ...
i want you to know , i wish i could have lived like you do .
what the fuck is going on ?
here he comes .
shut up !
you 've made a good life for yourself ...
what the fuck is going on here ? !
i wish i could have been a normal man like you . i wish i could have a simple life .
it 's close .
just keep leading the way .
sit back .
and , i remember breaking your nose . you 're only alive because i did n't kill you .
i seem to remember knocking on your door .
tell me what it was that gave me away . what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air .
really ? just biding your time , then ? toying with me . is that it ? letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in ?
we would have gotten you eventually .
you 're going to be remembered , and it 's all because of me . and , the only reason i 'm here right now is because i wanted to be .
and , why is that ?
you should be thanking me .
delusions of grandeur .
a woman ... so ugly on the inside that she could n't bare to go on living if she could n't be beautiful on the outside . a drug dealer ... a drug dealing pederast , actually . and , do n't forget the disease spreading whore . only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face . that 's the point . you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner , and in every home , literally . and we tolerate it . because it 's common , it seems trivial , and we tolerate , all day long , morning , noon and night . not anymore . i 'm setting the example , and it 's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed , from now on .
murderers like you ?
a woman ...
murderers ?
innocent ? is that supposed to be funny ? look at the people i killed . an obese man , a disgusting man who could barely stand up ... who if you saw him on the street , you 'd point so your friends could mock him along with you . who if you saw him while you were eating , you would n't be able to finish your meal . after him i picked the lawyer . and , you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one . this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster ... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets .
you only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off . that 's all .
you would n't because you know there are consequences . it 's in those eyes of yours , though ... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work . i wo n't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner . i only took their sins to logical conclusions .
now ... i would n't do something like that , johnny . i like you . i like you a lot .
i ... i doubt i enjoyed it any more than ... detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows . is n't that true ? how happy would it make you to hurt me , with impunity ?
oh , do n't worry . you wo n't ...
well , i 'll be standing beside you the whole time , so you be sure to let me know when this whole , complete reality thing is done . would n't want to miss it .
i ca n't wait for you to see . i ca n't wait ... it 's really going to be something .
it 's going to be flawless . people will barely be able to comprehend it . it will seem almost surreal ... but it will have a tangible reality , so they wo n't be able to deny it .
spit it out .
you ca n't see the whole ... the whole complete act yet . not yet . but , when this is done , it 's going to be ... so ... so ...
in two months , no one 's going to even remember this happened .
you know that 's not true .
i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours .
not me . i 'm not special . i 'm not exceptional . this is , though . what i 'm doing .
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ?
wanting people to pay attention , you ca n't just tap them on the shoulder . you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer . then , you have their strict attention .
we 're not just going to pick up two more bodies , are we , johnny ? that would n't be ... shocking enough . would n't keep you on the front page of the newspapers .
you 'll see .
where we headed ?
put the gun down , somerset !
do n't do this ... please ...
put your gun down ! !
i ca n't let you do this ...
tell me it 's not true .
what did you say ?
throw your weapon , detective ! now !
what are you talking about ? what happened ?
throw your gun down now !
there 's no time to discuss it !
wait !
stay with him .
give me a break .
kiss me on the lips .
slut .
well , i have to tell you ... i think i 've fallen in love with you .
what is it ?
i will .
if john doe 's head splits open and a u.f.o . flies out , i want you to have expected it .
i can tell you this . i recognize his lawyer . his name 's mark swarr .
no .
he 's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece , right ? can you even conceive of what 's going to happen next ? i mean , can you even imagine how he 'll try to finish it ?
well ... what the fuck , man ?
you and i are , probably for the first time ever , in total agreement . he would n't just stop .
you know he 's fucking us .
when do we get to question him ?
because he is john doe , by choice .
big surprise .
as soon as this is over , i 'm gone .
no , actually , i was n't sure at all .
you knew i 'd say yes .
i 'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days . you 'd be doing me the favor .
you think you 're doing me a big favor by staying ?
one of two things will happen . we 're either going to get john doe , or he 'll finish his series of seven , and this case will go on for years .
oh , you want to stay now ?
call for help , and you 'll live . but , you 'll be disfigured . or , put yourself out of your misery .
he cut her up and dressed the wounds .
that part of me is dead .
listen to yourself . you say , `` the problem with people is they do n't care , so i do n't care about people . '' but , you 're already here . you 've been here a long time . so , there 's a part of you that knows , even if everything you say is true , none of it matters .
no i 'm not ! i 'm talking about common , everyday life here . if you let yourself worry about one thing , you 'll worry about the next , and the next , and it never ends . in this place , ignorance is n't just bliss , it 's a matter of survival .
you 're talking about people who are mentally ill. you 're ...
wrong ! i sympathize completely , because if you ca n't win ... then , if you do n't ignore everything and everyone around you , you ... you become like john doe . it 's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it , because it takes so much work to love . you just have to make sure you do n't stop to think about the abuse , and the damage , because you 'll risk being sad . keep ignoring .
oh , you 're so much better than everyone , right ? no one 's worthy of you .
it was n't one thing , if that 's what you mean . i just ... i ca n't live here anymore . i ca n't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue .
what the fuck is wrong with you ? what burnt you out ?
people do n't want a champion . they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers .
you think you 're preparing me for the hard times ahead ? you think you 're toughening me up ? well , you 're not ! you 're quitting , fine ... but i 'm staying .
why do n't you shut the fuck up for a while ? you bitch and complain ... if i thought like you , i would have slit my wrist already .
just know that in this case there 's not going to be any satisfaction . if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself , if it turned out he were actually satan , then , that might live up to our expectations . no human being could do these things , right ? but , this is not the devil . it 's just a man .
you follow the law and do the best you can . it 's all there .
where 's the victory ?
you do your job ...
you tell me , then ... you walk into an apartment , and a man has beaten his wife to death , or the wife murdered the husband , and you have to wash the blood off their children . you put the killer in jail . who won ?
you 're the oldest man i know , somerset .
do n't try to focus on things as black and white , because you 'll go blind . there 's no winning and losing here .
how can you say that ? especially after today ?
no . face it now . stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys .
if we get him , i 'll be happy enough .
you know ... there 's not going to be a happy ending to this . it 's not possible anymore .
one birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book , `` the century of the detective , '' by jurgen thorwald . it traced the history of deduction as a science , and it sealed my fate , because it was real , not fiction . and , that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime ... it was incredible to me .
sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps .
the irony is , after a day of the type of work he did , he 'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories . murders in the rue morgue . le fanu 's green tea . my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours .
these murders are his masterwork . his sermon to all of us . to all us sinners .
he 's preaching .
looking around ... i 've got a bad feeling these murders are his life 's work .
no dates indicated , placed on the shelves in no discernible order . it 's just his mind poured out on paper . i do n't think it 's going to give us any specifics .
`` what sick , ridiculous , puppets we are , and what a gross , little stage we dance on . what fun we have , dancing and fucking , not a care in the world . not knowing that we are nothing . we are not what was intended . ''
then , he must write about these murders .
well , there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room , and near as i can tell , each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages .
i 'm trying , alright ? just tell me what we 've got .
we could use about fifty more men here .
we had him .
what are you talking about ?
no point in arguing anymore ...
you stupid son of a ...
okay ... okay ... get off .
think it through . if we leave a hole like this , we 'll never prosecute . he 'll walk . we have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door .
by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead .
think about how we got here !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
think about it ...
we have probable cause now .
we need a warrant .
the hell i ca n't ! we get in there and we can stop him .
you ca n't go in there .
it was him .
wait ... just wait .
what happened ?
i 'm fine .
are you alright ?
who told you about my silver tongue ? you been talking to my wife ?
you do the talking . put that old silver tongue of yours to work .
what are you going to say ?
sure . uh , excuse me ... are you by any chance a serial killer ? oh , you are ? well , come with us then , if it 's okay .
we 'll take a look at him . talk to him .
this is stupid . it 'd be just too easy .
that 's what it says . jonathan doe .
you 're sure you 're reading that right ? john doe ?
saint thomas aquinas . he wrote about the seven deadly sins .
the writings of saint thomas aqu ... aquin ...
that is .
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism .
it 's not what you think it is .
modern homicide investigation . in cold blood . of human bondage . human bondage ?
the divine comedy . a history of catholicism . a book called murderers and madmen .
i know , i know ... focusing on one little thing .
we 're focusing .
this is a waste of time .
i do n't . neither do you .
how do you know all about this ?
yeah , well ... at least we 're out of the office . we 've got pizza .
yeah . some college student who 's taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime .
if you want to know who 's been reading paradise lost , purgatory , and say ... the life and time of charlie manson , the bureau 's computer will tell you . it might give us a name .
so they ran our list .
legal ... illegal . these terms do n't apply . i do n't applaud it .
how is this legal ?
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable ... communism to violent crime .
you got to be kidding .
they monitor reading habits . not every book , but certain ones are flagged . books about ... let 's say , how to build a nuclear bomb , or maybe mein kampf . whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the f.b.i . from then on .
what ? assessing fines ?
for a long time , the f.b.i . 's been hooked into the library system , keeping accurate records .
him ?
it 's probably nothing , but even if it is , it 's no skin off our teeth . the man at hot dog world is a friend , in the bureau .
it 's be best if you got to the point , cause i 'm about ready to punch you in the face .
by telling you this , i 'm trusting you more than i trust most people .
let 's go .
well , that was money well spent .
i do n't know ... like fifty .
how much money do you have ?
what does all that matter anyway ? it 's not our job to figure him out , is it ? all we have to do is catching him .
just , realize ... this is not some common lunatic . the type of intestinal fortitude it must take ... to keep a man bound for a full year . to connect tubes to his genitals . to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints . he 's methodical and exacting , and worst of all , he 's patient .
just because the bastard has a library card , it does n't make him einstein .
well , he 's been right so far , has n't he ?
and so what ?
this quote ... his first words to us . i looked it up . it 's from milton 's paradise lost . `` long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light ... ``
yes we do . here ...
we do n't know for sure ...
no . he 's not depending on luck . you 've seen that . we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed , to the day . to the day ! because he wanted us to .
sooner or later his luck 's goning to run out .
no .
hey , freud , what brand of bullshit are you shoveling , huh ? right now he 's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy 's panties , singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter ...
it 's a fine line between insane and inspired .
oh , blah , blah , blah . the guy 's insane .
it 's too dismissive to call him a lunatic . we ca n't make that mistake .
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow . i mean , christ ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves .
this is the job . it 's not an easter egg hunt .
i 'm sick of sitting around , waiting for him to kill again .
who pays the rent on time .
a landlord 's dream tenant : a paralyzed man with no tongue .
victor 's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month . he says , quote , `` i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one , and nobody ever complained about him . he 's the best tenant i 've ever had .
oh , it 's alright .
sorry about that ... i just ...
they pay cops for the inside scoop , and they pay well .
how do those cockroaches get here so quick ?
he 'll string us along all the way if we 're not careful .
i do n't know about you , but i feed off my emotions .
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here . no matter how hard it is , we have to stay focused on the details .
no kidding ! no fucking kidding !
listen to me . he 's all about playing games .
i want him bad . i do n't just want to catch him anymore . i want to hurt him .
the way this has gone till now , i would n't have thought it was possible , but we may have underestimated this guy .
call an ambulance .
it is victor .
sounds like he knew what he was talking about .
i think hemingway wrote somewhere ... i ca n't remember where , but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this , you have to have the ability to kill . i think he meant you truly must be able to do it , not just faking it , too survive .
i expected it to be bad , you know . i took a human life ... but i slept like a baby that night . i never gave it a second thought .
how was it ?
i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch . see , i was doing really good up till then . lots of street busts . i 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . i got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . next thing i know , the mayor 's pinning a medal on me . picture in the paper , whole nine yards .
how did the fire fight end ?
it was my first one of these . we were a secondary unit , and i was pretty shaky going in . i was still considered a rookie .
and ?
never took a bullet . i pulled my gun once . fired it once .
never in my twenty-four years , knock on wood . i 've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it . never fired it though . not once . you ?
satisfy our curiosity ?
why would we ?
we 'll tag along .
yes . they were there ... so , it must be .
the fingerprints .
he does n't have the desire somehow . our killer seems to have more purpose . more purpose than victor could ever conceive of .
you tell me . i 'm new in town .
does n't seem like our man , does it ?
does this make it with you ?
in this city , if all the skeletons came out of all the closets ... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again , there 'd be no more room for the living .
i 've seen the same . i 'm not the country hick you seem to think i am .
i 'm , sorry , but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues . i 've seen so many corpses rolled away ... unrevenged .
bullshit .
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away , on the slim chance it 's ever needed in a courtroom . it 's like collecting diamonds on a desert island . you keep them just in case you ever get rescued , but it 's a pretty big ocean out there .
oh , that 's all .
all we do is pick up the pieces . we take all the evidence , and all the pictures and samples . we write everything down and note what time things happened ...
then , you tell me what you think we 're doing .
i wish i still thought like you .
and you do n't ?
you meant what you said to mrs. gould , did n't you ? about catching this guy . you really want to believe that , do n't you ?
who the hell knows ? there 's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they do n't want to do . you know ... little voices tell them bad things .
it does n't fit . he does n't want us to help him stop .
he just may be nuts enough .
no .
just , honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this ... been involved in anything like this ?
just wait !
oh , yeah , sure . you got to be kidding ? !
bear with me .
what ?
we 're screwed . he 's fucking with us .
there must be something .
a switchblade .
what the fuck is that ?
it 's got to be .
nothing .
even if they did , those photos were taken before forensics .
you 're sure your men did n't move this ?
okay . but , what ?
what if it 's not that she 's seen something ? what if she 's supposed to see something , but she just has n't been given a chance to see it yet ?
i know .
this is the one thing .
none . which i do n't understand . he had to get back out .
no witnesses of any kind ?
totally unrelated victims .
nothing .
no fingerprints ?
like , because someone 's holding a gun on you .
attrition . when you regret your sins , but not because you love god .
forced what ?
for now , let 's just consider the books as the murderer 's inspiration . the books and sermons are about atonement for sin . and , these murders have been like forced attrition .
right . but there , pride comes first , not gluttony . the sins are in a different order .
seven terraces of purgation .
yeah . parts of them . anyway , in purgatory , dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain ... seeing all these other guys who sinned ...
did you read them ?
like in the parson 's tale , and dante .
the sins were used in medieval sermons . there were seven cardinal virtues , and then seven deadly sins , created as a learning tool , because they distract from true worship .
punishing .
he 's preaching .
we put her in a safe house .
and , if it 's a threat .
gould 's wife . she was away on business . if this means she saw anything , i do n't know what . we 've questioned her at least five times .
this is just to satisfy my curiosity . i 'm still leaving town saturday .
look , i appreciate being able to talk this out , but , uh ...
he must have left another puzzle piece .
he cut along the side of his stomach . the love handle .
all day saturday , and all day sunday . the murderer would want gould to take his time . to have to sit there and decide . where do you make the first cut ? there 's a gun in your face ... but , what part of your body is expendable ?
the leather chair was soaked through with sweat .
well , his body was found monday night , okay ? but , get this ... the office was closed all day monday . which means , as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend , our killer could 've gotten in here on friday . he could 've spent all day saturday with gould , and all day sunday .
i 'm certain . he was the biggest defense lawyer around . infamous , actually .
our guy got into office , probably before the building closed and security tightened up . gould must have been working late .
i vaguely recall a large , angry man , and someone called norton .
you 've never seen `` the odd couple ? '' this is sick . `` the honeymooners ? ! ''
i just have to say , i ca n't respect any man who 's never seen `` green acres . ''
i read . remember reading ?
you go to movies at least ?
what about them ?
what about sports ?
all television does is teach children that it 's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day .
hello .
i 'd like you to meet somerset .
tonight .
how 's that ?
i 'm invited to have a late supper at your house . and , i accept .
well ?
what ?
it 's my wife .
detective mills here . honey ... i asked you not to call me here . i 'll call you back ... what ? why ?
it 's a package deal . you get the phone with the office .
can we talk about this in private ?
it 's too soon for him .
whoa , whoa ... what ? !
i 'm declining this case . i want us reassigned .
this is a premeditated puzzle , and it 's only the beginning .
this is his stuff . i 've been out in the cold all day .
this was one sadistic motherfucker .
he ate his fill , and was forced to continue eating ... till his body rejected the food . the killer held a bucket under him , and then kept serving . he took his time . the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours . the victim 's throat was swollen from the effort , and there was probably a point where he passed out . that 's when killer kicked him in the stomach . popped him .
but , why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing ? it must have been intentional .
it could be nothing .
you always have to find one singular thing to focus on . there 's always one thing , and it may be as small as a speck of dust , but you find it and focus ... till it 's an exhausted possibility .
this does n't make any sense .
have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink ? near the food ?
same color and texture .
i just do n't think we should have that sort of relationship . we 'd start quarreling over insignificant things .
okay ... sure ... it 's just that , with my old partner , you know ...
is that clear ?
yeah , well , all i want is ... just , just do n't be jerking me off . that 's all i ask . do n't jerk me off .
i made a decision , because i have to consider the integrity of the scene . i ca n't worry whether you think you 're getting enough time on the playing field .
the badge in my pocket says `` detective , '' same as yours .
good .
anyway ... i did my time on door-to-doors , and walking a beat . i did all that shit for a long time .
no .
you 've seen my files , right ? seen the things i 've done ?
guessing at this point is useless .
you think it was poison ?
i do n't know . feel free to look for yourself , okay ?
is there any blood in it ?
it 's a bucket of vomit .
there 's a bucket . under the table .
what ?
there 's a bucket here .
please be quiet for a while , would you ?
when we found him , he was lying there with a knife in his back , so what else could it be but homicide ? except , i finally figured out ... he held the knife behind him ... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall ... then he shoved his body backwards ...
then , why are we wasting our time ? this guy 's heart 's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham . if this is n't a coronary , i do n't know what is .
no one yet .
who said this was murder ?
for now .
drop it .
and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a dead man who was n't really dead until davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut .
i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into ?
well , over the next seven days , do me the favor of remembering it .
i realize that .
not here .
i was n't standing around guarding the local taco bell . i 've worked homicide for five and a half years .
let me tell you how i want this to go . i want you to look , and i want you to listen .
maybe i thought i could do more good here than there . i do n't know . look , it 'd be great by me if we did n't start right off kicking each other in the balls . but , you 're calling the shots , lieutenant , so ... however you want it to go .
it 's very simple . you worked a nice , quiet town , but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it . i 've just never seen it done that way before , detective .
maybe i 'm not understanding the question .
you just met me .
i 'm here for the same reasons as you , i guess . or , at least , the same reasons you used to have for being here before ... before you decided to ... quit .
all this effort you 've made to get transferred , it 's the first question that pops into my head .
i ... i do n't follow .
i meant to ask you something , mills , when we spoke on the phone . i ca n't help wondering ... why here ?
i need to start getting the feel of it all , right ? meet the people .
actually , if it 's all the same , i 'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p . seeing how we do n't have much time for this whole transition thing .
since we 're just starting out , i thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . after that , we 'll ...
i 'm a little thrown . i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here .
why is this painting hanging upside-down ?
what ?
this painting ...
i ca n't do this now ... please .
are you absolutely certain ?
i do n't see anything .
anything ... anything missing or different .
please , i need you to help me if we 're going to get who did this .
i do n't know why ... why now ?
i need you to look at each one carefully ... very carefully . look for anything that seems strange or out of place . anything at all .
i ... i do n't understand .
i 'm sorry about this , mrs. gould . i really am .
i can tell you now , i know ... i 'm positive i made the right decision . i 'm positive . but , there 's never a day that passes that i do n't wish i had decided differently .
i want to have children . it 's just ...
well , i got up one morning and went to work ... just like any other day , except it was my first since hearing about the baby . and , i ... i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me . i looked around , and i thought , how can we raise a child surrounded by all this ? how can a child grow up here ? so , that night , i told her i did n't want us to have it , and over the next few weeks , i convinced her it was wrong . i mean ... i wore her down , slowly .
i hate this city .
oh , tracy ... i have to tell you , i 'm not the one to talk to about this .
i do n't know ...
you should look into private schools .
i 've been going to some of the schools , looking for work , but the conditions here are ... horrible .
he mentioned it .
i ca n't be a burden , especially now . i know i 'll get used to things . i guess i wanted to know what someone who 's lived here thinks . upstate , it was a completely different environment . i do n't know if david told you , but i teach fifth grade , or did .
talk to him about it . he 'll understand if you tell him how you feel .
i do n't know why i asked you to come .
you have to put blinders on sometimes . most times .
perfect example .
i 'm sorry , i only ...
i feel strange being here with you ... without david knowing .
i do n't sleep very well .
it 's a hard place .
i mean , you known this city . you 've been here for so long .
if you can , please call me . please . i have to go now ... goodnight .
i do n't know , with this case .
too long . what do you think so far ?
how long have you lived here ?
any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me ... disagreeable . just ask your husband .
it surprises me . it really does .
i was close once . it just did n't happen .
i guess i wo n't be showing it to him then .
you have a strange way about you ... i mean interesting . i 'm sorry . it 's really none of my business . it 's just nice to meet a man who talks like that . if david saw that paper , he 'd say you 're a fag . that 's how he is .
no matter how often i see guns , i still ca n't get used to them .
do n't worry . i do n't wear it at the dinner table .
really ?
high school and college , yes . pretty hokey , huh ? i knew on our first date this was the man i was going to marry . god ... he was the funniest man i 'd ever met .
i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts .
what ? oh , yes . i mean , thank you . please , sit down .
it smells good .
it 's a nice name . william , i 'd like you to meet david . david ... william .
oh ... um , william .
it 's nice to meet you . my husband has told me a lot about you ... except your first name .
i do n't know .
did their son see it happen ?
this is a done deal . all but the paperwork .
yes . look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here .
crime of passion .
why always like this ? only after the fact ... this sudden realization , that if you shoot someone , or stick a knife in them , that person will cease to exist .
when the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together . she was crying too hard to say anything .
did the wife confess ?
neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours . it was nothing new . but , then they heard the gun go off . both barrels .
do n't argue ! ... and stay close ... maybe they 're rustlers ... and maybe this dodderin ' old idiot ai n't so far wrong ...
now , ethan , i ai n't sure ...
you 're my brother ... you 're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to ... ai n't that so , martha ?
you askin ' me to clear out now ?
they gave up ... went back to the cotton rows ... so 'd the jamisons ... without martha , i do n't know ... she would n't let a man quit .
passed the todd place comin ' in ... what happened to 'em ?
it just happened to be me ... no need to make any more of it ...
it was ethan found you squallin ' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred ...
that old goat still creakin ' around ? ... why n't someone bury him ?
but mose harper said ...
how should i know ?
how 's california ?
i wish uncle ethan was here . do n't you , ma ?
what , ben ?
it 's all right , ma ... i been watchin ' ... only i wish ...
it 's not a sword , ma ... it 's a sabre ! did you kill many damyankees with this sabre , uncle ethan ?
not tonight ... ben , put that sword back .
that 's enough ... go on inside and help lucy set the table ... you , too , deborah !
an ' she 's got a beau ! kisses him , too !
lucy 's going on seventeen now ...
what you saw was a buck wearin ' lucy 's dress ... i found lucy back there in that canyon ... i wrapped her in my blanket an ' buried her with m'own hands ... i thought it best to keep it from you -- long as i could .
it was , i tell you !
what you saw was n't lucy .
huh ... ? no ... no water .
why 'd they break off ? was there water in that canyon ?
that 'll be the day ! ... let 's ride .
you 've said that enough ! ... maybe lucy 's dead ... maybe they 're both dead ... but if i hear it from you again , i 'll fight ya , mr. edwards !
naw ... a human man rides a horse till it dies ... then he goes on afoot ... a comanche comes along ... gets that horse up ... and rides it twenty more miles ... then he eats it .
they got to stop < u > sometime < /u > ... if they 're human at all , they got to stop !
why do n't you finish the job ?
let 's get along ...
stealing the cattle was just to pull us out ... this here 's a murder raid ... it shapes up to scald out either your place ... or my brother 's .
killed every one -- an ' not for food either ... why 'd they do a thing like that ?
i ai n't wearing no gun .
it 's all right ... charlie , let 's move outside .
and other things ... mebbe you thought you was gettin ' away with being comical about that indian wife you took ... i bet she was n't the first squaw you ...
if you 're talkin ' about that crazy murder charge ...
what right you got to be talkin ' marriage to any decent woman ...
as to that , i do n't know , charlie ... we had n't got around to talkin ' marriage ...
she sure is ! ... an ' do n't think your comin ' back is goin ' to change it !
< u > charlie < /u > < u > maccorry < /u > ! ... you were n't fixin ' to marry him ? ?
yes sir ...
ethan , you an ' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay ... charlie , hightail it to head- quarters an ' spread the word ...
now , now ... let 's not grow dis- putatious ...
you 're goin ' if the captain says you 're goin ' ...
well , go get cleaned up and we 'll proceed with the weddin ' ...
dunno ... seems so .
you all right , sergeant ?
in that case , give the boys room ...
no sir ... pleasure .
is this in the line of duty , sergeant ?
well , that 's seven we can score up to your brother , ethan .
this 'un come a long way 'fore he died .
another one , eh ?
go ahead , son ... but at the first alarm , we 're comin ' in -- and we ai n't goin ' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do ...
i say no !
now mount up , son ...
i did n't < u > want < /u > to tell you ... but maybe it 's your right to know .
there sure is ! i 'm going to tell you somethin ' ... i was n't going to speak of it ... but i 'll tell you now . did you notice them scalps strung on scar 's lance ? did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance ? long ... wavy hair ...
now son , it 's a bitter thing to say , but there 's more than your sister at stake here .
enough to go around ... i 'd say about a dozen apiece ... mount 'em up !
how many , would you say ?
we can get within 500 yards ... there 's a hogback to the south .
< u > captain < /u > ... nope , would n't say that ... likely you had your reasons for killin ' futterman ... probably needed killin ' ... i 'm speaking as a ranger now , not as a reverend ... fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that 's raised some question -- that and a missin ' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise .
this an invite to a necktie party , reverend ?
i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me , ethan .
comanches do n't use their fists , reverend ... let 'em alone ...
fight fair , son ... use your fists !
came here for a wedding , ethan ... until that 's over , i reckon 'reverend ' will do ...
evenin ' ... evenin ' reverend ... or do i call you 'captain ' ... ?
you got one now !
that 's all right , captain ... i do n't need any formal invitation to kill a comanch ...
i did n't give any order to fire !
how far 's the river from here , mose ?
if you were tryin ' to surround 'em , you sure succeeded .
just keep goin ' ...
you got any more orders , captain ?
yes , sir ... but if you 're wrong , < u > captain < /u > clayton , do n't ever give me another !
... as you have of findin ' those girls alive by ridin ' into 'em ... i say we do it my way , ethan ... and that 's an order !
what do you know about it ? ... what 's a quarter-breed cherokee know about the comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him ... you got as much chance of stampedin ' their herd as ...
i thought we were trying to get the girls back -- < u > alive < /u > ... we jump those comanches , they 'll kill 'em ... you know that !
it 's what we 're here for , ai n't it ?
you 're right sure you want to < u > jump < /u > 'em , ethan ?
they 're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here . soon 's it gets dark we 'll circle out so 's to jump 'em before day- break .
by what you preach ... none !
what good does that do ?
... like a flower and is cut down ... < u > amen < /u > !
amen ! ... put an 'amen ' to it !
he cometh forth like a ...
i figger a man 's only good for one oath at a time ... i took mine to the confederate states of america ... so did you , reverend ...
you fit a lot of descriptions .
got a warrant ?
i 'm askin ' as a ranger of the sovereign state of texas .
you askin ' as a reverend or a captain , sam ?
why ? you wanted for a crime , ethan ?
you can forget that ... would n't be legal anyway .
well , swear him out again ! ... i 'll go with you .
he sure < u > is < /u > goin ' ... he 's sworn in .
you ai n't goin ' ...
i do n't believe in surrenderin ' ... i still got my sabre , reverend ... never turned it into any ploughshare neither !
have n't seen you since the surrender . come to think of it , i did n't see you < u > at < /u > the surrender .
yes , sir ...
all right ... but keep your eye on me , boy ... i 'm the hard case you 're up against here -- not these childish savages ... if you do n't hear me first time i holler , you better read my mind ... i do n't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand ...
but he knows that , sir ... ca n't i stay , sir ?
god forbid ... no , son , you flog on back and tell your pa where we 're at ... and where he 's at ...
if there 's anything i can do , sir ...
well you found me ... good work , son ... good work .
yes , sir ... troop 's about ten miles back ... the colonel sent me looking for you ...
never mind ... your pa know you 're out here ?
sir ?
go on ! why n't you have your bugler sound the charge while you 're at it ? ?
captain clayton ... captain !
what in ... ?
sonny , yonder 's a passel of murderers , complete with texican scalps an ' white girl captive ... you want to protect us , you just get out of our way ... now < u > skedaddle < /u > !
but ... but captain , we ca n't possibly take the field tomorrow ... for your own protection ...
you tell your pa a company of rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an ' equipped will be in the field by daylight ... headin ' for the south end of the malapai . if he can catch up with us , well an ' good ...
yesterday , one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago ... he talks crazy but i brought him along ... says he lives here ... keeps mentioning a rocking chair .
and what makes you think he 's in this territory ?
yes sir ... we 've received information about a band of comanches under a chief named scar ...
joint action ?
my pa wants to know ... < u > colonel < /u > < u > greenhill < /u > wants to know how soon you could put a company of your rangers in the field , fully armed and equipped , for joint punitive action against the comanches .
oh ... now what 's this your pa wants to know ?
why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill , sir ... commanding officer , fifth u.s. cavalry ... i 'm lieutenant greenhill , sir .
hold on , son ... who 's this colonel greenhill you 're talking about ?
colonel greenhill 's compliments , sir . the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field , fully armed and ...
i 'm clayton .

ay-eh ... they was here ...
ai n't yours yet .
do n't forget to come back with my thousand dollars .
in that case you wo n't find her -- and i wo n't get my thousand dollars .
and maybe you lie ...
scar 's band was headin ' north ... to winter in at fort wingate ... eatin ' agency beef . that 's what this buck said ... maybe he lied .
keep talking .
me neither ... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches .
scar ? never heard of any chief scar .
a young buck fetched it in late last summer ... said it belonged to a captive chile of chief scar ...
talk !
you got it with you ?
that 's what i said .
you said there 'd be a thousand dollar reward .
how 'd you come by this ?
that 'll be the day ... 'as we developed the village ' ... next time you develop a village , hit it where the fightin ' men are ... you wo n't get any headlines for killin ' squaws .
keefer ! ..put this man under arrest !
are you sure they did n't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o ' yank bluebellies so scared they could n't tell the difference between a cheyenne and a comanche ?
well ... i know there were some captives recovered ...
my name 's edwards ... i 'm looking for my niece ... she was in that camp when you attacked ...
that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche ... chief scar 's bunch ...
i beg your pardon ?
< u > cheyenne < /u > ! what cheyenne ?
sir -- we charged ! ..gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i can not say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp ...
you do n't remember it , but i remember . that was your mother 's scalp !
i saw it ... and do n't try to tell me it was aunt martha 's or lucy 's ...
she 's alive ... better she 's alive and livin ' with comanches than her brains bashed out ...
livin ' with comanches ai n't bein ' alive ...
i know you are ... only it ai n't goin ' to be that way ... she 's alive ...
it 's what i 'm countin ' on .
wait ! we go chargin ' in , they 'll kill her ... and you know it .
what 's goin ' on ?
what 's that got to do with us ?
she 's been with the bucks ! she 's nothin ' now but a ...
you can keep your will ! i ai n't forgettin ' you was all set to shoot her yourself ... what kind o ' man are you , anyway .
not no more .
'i , ethan edwards , being of sound mind and without any blood kin , do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to martin pauley ... ' i do n't want your property ... . 'sides , what do you mean no 'blood kin ? ' debbie 's your blood kin ...
we wo n't be here ... come on !
they 'll be back ...
over there !
go on ! get out of here while you can ...
debbie , you 're comin ' with us ! hear me ?
how ? she 's even forgot her own language !
i do n't know ... somethin ' tied his hands ... maybe hospitality ...
why did n't he make his move back there ?
he 's got to ... all these years , run- nin ' , dodgin ' , knowin ' we were after him ... now we caught up ... it 's him or us .
you figger scar means to kill us ?
not likely .
stay out here .
cicatriz is mex for < u > scar < /u > ... an ' he has a white girl in his tepee ... be seein ' you ...
never heard of him ...
suit yourself ... while you 're enjoyin ' your little conversation , i 'll be ridin ' out with senor fernandez here ... the comanch ' medicine country ai n't far ... there 's one camp with a chief named cicatriz .
you breeds are all alike -- two drinks an ' ...
lem me alone ...
i ai n't sure ... where 's that doll ?
no ... she 's not ...
what 'd the soldiers have to kill her for ! ..
well , you 're a widower now ...
ai n't that too bad ... if you feel that sorry for your kinfolk , i 'm surprised you did n't take up with that squaw wife of yours ...
peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo , too ... .
least , < u > they < /u > wo n't feed any comanches this winter ... killin ' buffalo 's as good as killin ' injuns in this country .
what 's the sense in it !
nine ... ten !
ethan , quit it !
yeah , i kinda figgered you 'd say that ... bein ' a new husband and all ...
i think maybe we oughta ...
how should < u > i < /u > know ... she 's your wife !
think she means for us to follow ?
she ai n't goin ' back to her family , that 's certain ... not if she took off where the arrow points .
beats me how she could get that pony out o ' camp without neither of us hearin ' a thing ...
look ! scar ? ... do you know where he went ? and if he has a girl with him ... a < u > white < /u > girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo ...
you ask her !
look ?
says her name 's wild goose flying in the night sky ... but she 'll answer to look since it pleases ya ...
cut it out , will ya ...
that 's the way to train 'em . looks like mrs. pauley 's goin ' to make you a fine beautiful wife ...
and have her whole family after our scalps for floutin ' one o ' their women ? ... no sir ! come on , mrs. pauley ...
oh no ! tell her she 's got to go back ...
you got yourself a < u > wife < /u > , sonny !
what ?
< u > you < /u > do n't understand , ya chunkhead ! < u > you < /u > did n't buy any blanket ! ya bought < u > her < /u > !
think it might be ... ?
what i heard back there was that a band o ' hostile nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago ...
forget it ...
but i just bought a good blanket .
when are you goin ' to learn to keep your mouth shut ! come on . let 's get out of here .
scar ?
let 's go ... i think i stumbled onto somethin ' ...
whatchu doin ' ? ...
he just could n't wait ...
futterman ?
you all settled an ' comfortable now ?
oh ...
sorta like 'roundabout ' -- like a man says he 's goin ' one place when he means to go just the reverse ...
what 's that ?
not so funny ... if you recollect what 'nawyecka ' means ...
maybe i 'm gettin ' like mose harper -- my bones is cold tonight ...
hey ! what 's the idea ... ?
good night .
yeah ... you want me to know i ai n't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man 's clothes to wear ! ..you tole me that already ... now shut your head !
martin ... i want you to know some- thin ' ...
how ? you got any horses , or money to buy 'em ... you ai n't even got money to buy cartridges ... jorgensen 's offering you a good livin ' here ...
all right ... i ai n't got no kin ... i 'm goin ' to keep lookin ' that 's all .
that do n't make 'em kin ...
i always felt like she was ... her folks takin ' me in , raisin ' me like one of their own ...
she 's your nothin ' ... she 's no kin to you at all !
because she 's my ... my ...
why ?
i ai n't stayin ' ... i set out lookin ' for debbie ... i aim to keep on ...
he 's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while i 'm gone ... i 'll be pushin ' on tomorrow ...
your cattle ? ... < u > debbie 's < /u > cattle !
jorgensen 's been runnin ' his cattle with my own ...
good night ...
good night ... laurie ...
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he 's chased it enough ... then he quits ... same when he runs ... seems he never learns there 's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin ' on ... so we 'll find them in the end , i promise you that ... we 'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth .
and you think we got a chance to find her ?
no ... our turnin ' back do n't change anything ... not in the long run . if she 's alive , she 's safe ... for a while ... they 'll keep her to raise as one of their own , 'til she 's of an age to ...
say it . we 're beat !
get some sleep ... tomorrow 's another day ...
what you goin ' to do ?
must 've ... anyway , i ai n't goin ' back to look for it ...
say ! ... what happened to your blanket ? lose it ?
huh ... ? sure i 'm all right ...
you all right , ethan ?
no ... nor build bonfires ... nor beat drums neither . i 'll meet you on the far side .
you want us to fire a shot if ...
they 're with 'em -- if they 're still alive .
sorry ... we do n't even know if debbie 'n lucy are with this bunch ... maybe they split up ...
easy on that !
if they 're still alive ...
why , sure , ethan ... there 's just the one thing we 're after ... finding deborah and lucy ...
all right ... but i 'm givin ' the orders ... you take 'em or we split up here and now ...
leggo ...
nothing for you to see .
easy ! it 's forty miles , sonny ... horses can do with some grain and a little rest .
well , come on !
well , fust off ...
name 's ethan ... now what 's so mighty fishy about this trail ?
what you want me to call you ?
do n't have to call me 'sir ' neither ... nor grampaw neither ... nor methuselah neither ... i can whup you to a frazzle .
yes , sir .
stop callin ' me 'uncle ' ... i ai n't your uncle .
somethin ' mighty fishy about this trail , uncle ethan ...
you 've done a lot of growin ' ...
not quite ... quarter cherokee . the rest is welsh ... so they tell me .
time 's running out ... but i 'm obliged to you .
that 's the breed ... course it might take time .
comancheros ...
there 's one thing . we recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp ... cheap stuff ... trade goods ... could n't help noticing that most of it was mexican ... maybe if you could talk to some of those mexican traders along the border ... what do they call themselves ?
well , we only got the one lead -- scar ... and where we begin to look , i do n't know ...
they 're not white any more -- they 're < u > comanche < /u > ! ... let 's see the bodies ...
hard to realize they 're white , is n't it ...
not far from it ...
was your niece about their age ?
i 've seen her ... and she 's alive .
you 've seen her ! ... she 's alive ?
she 's not a little girl any more .
no ... not yet ...
yes ! ..yes , i remember ! ..have they found her , ethan ?
you ever see it before ... like mebbe on a dress debbie wore ?
why it 's just a snip of calico ...
do n't go blamin ' yourself ...
i got your boy killed .
well , you did all a body could , ethan .
i am ... i am ... it 's just that i know martha 'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls ... and if the girls are ... dead ... ethan , do n't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance !
i 'd be obliged if you 'd get to the point , ma'am .
yours truly ... and he even has to write his full name ... martin pauley ... not even just < u > martie < /u > ! ... i do n't care if he < u > never < /u > comes back !
they never find that girl .
a little comanche squaw - squaw !
every young man should at least once ... go on , laurie ! read !
that means mister futterman is dead , by golly .
the < u > late < /u > mister futterman ?
dear miss laury ... i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them com- anches the late mister futterman told us about ...
who cares what he spells it ? read the letter .
'dear miss laury ' ... he spells it with a y instead of an i ... e ... would n't you think he 'd know ...
from the beginning ...
oh , all right ! well ... martin says ...
only if i 'm dead !
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance ? ... he 'll put a bullet in her brain ! and i tell you martha would want him to !
< u > laurie < /u > ! shut your mouth !
fetch < u > what < /u > home ? ... the leavin 's of comanche bucks -- sold time an ' again to the highest bidder ? ... with savage brats of her own , most like ? ...
i got to fetch her home ...
it 's too late ... she 's a woman grown now ...
you crazy ?
martie ... do n't go ! not this time .
you do and i 'll die , martie ... i will ! i 'll just die !
do n't cry , laurie ... i understand how it is ... i 'll just go 'way ...
it is n't fair ...
but i allus loved you ... you know that , without my sayin ' it ... i could n't bring myself to ask you to wait ... the little i had ... not knowin ' how much longer until we found debbie ...
no , it was n't ... you mighta said you loved me ... you mighta asked me to wait ... at least that 'd have been something ...
it was n't much of a letter ...
one letter in five years ... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out ...
i ... i wrote you a letter ... reckon you did n't get it ...
i ca n't help it , laurie ... i just got ta catch up with ethan ...
take it and welcome ... but do n't count on finding me here when you get back ... i 've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin ' for you ... i ai n't cut out to be an old maid !
but that 's sweet-face -- your own good horse .
go on then ! pa 's in the barn saddlin ' the fort worth stud ... an ' you can take the light gelding with the blaze ...
i got ta catch up with him , laurie !
finish your breakfast ...
futterman ! ... he 's got a little tradin ' post on the south fork o ' the brazos ... laurie , i just got to get me a good horse ! think yer pa would ...
shush ! ... time for bed anyway ... likely these 'll need some takin ' in ... oh , martie , you 're that gaunted ! ... ma 's havin ' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and ...
might at least have left me my pants !
would n't bother me ... i would n't try it in front of pa , though , was i you ...
you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid ...
i 'm a woman , martie ... we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives ... when you 're little we even wash < u > you < /u > ... .how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i 'll never know ...
well i ai n't one of 'em !
what you gettin ' red-in-the-face for ? ... i have brothers , have n't i ?
ai n't worth the mendin ' ...
do n't go takin ' that stuff ...
sorry ... keep the column moving ! ..close ranks there !
but could n't you ... ?
you 'll have to wait until we reach the agency ... fall in behind the column ...
where ?
we got two around that age ...
she 'd be about thirteen now ...
you do n't remember ?
for god 's sake , what happened to me ?
i would n't have made it by myself .
how did you get me out of there ?
i have a yearning for ... smog , cars and many , many people ... a real dirty ... big city . what do you think ?
what ?
... so he 's dictating you a new bestseller ? whatever that is , it 's not our son .
you know , tommi wants me to become the man i used to be .
your book - that 's why you were always in the cellar !
it 's important - he knows the last chapter .
'he ' ? whom do you mean-
i told you , there is no way out . he wo n't let you go .
we loved each other once . have you forgotten that ?
oh , ellen . my sweet ellen ... of course i knew .
what are you talking about-
of course you 'll give me the blame again . like back then . just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - is n't that right , ellen ?
martin , damnit , what are you up to ? let go of me !
you know what i have to do now , and believe me : i do n't enjoy doing this .
it 's simply too dangerous here ! but no , you always have to have it your way .
martin , what-
damn it , look at you ! do n't you see what 's happening with you ? we need to get out of here , do n't you understand ? out of this house !
will you finally cut it out ? just in case you have n't noticed , i am trying to write a book here . and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it 's a pretty tough job . so why ca n't you just leave me alone ?
okay , so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors . `` there is something negative about the place ... '' what the hell are you trying to say ? come on ! spit it out !
this house , the whole damned area around here is one mass grave ... now you might call me crazy , but there is something negative about the place .
during the middle ages people were executed at every corner . what 's your point ?
hi , darling .
let me guess : another short circuit ?
an animal ? what kind of animal ? a goddamned t-rex , or what ?
maybe an animal .
old ? ! come look at this ! she has wounds . wounds on her head . like thrashes . or bites .
she was old .
look at this ! the dog ! she 's dead !
what ?
i have n't the slightest idea .
who 's that ?
the house - tommi - something just does n't jive here ...
what ? what am i supposed to sense ?
it 's just a feeling . do n't you sense it , too ?
ellen , what are you trying to prove , anyway ? that we 've created ourselves a ghost ? come on !
`` events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals ... ''
in the village . look what i found .
where have you been ?
oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk !
but that 's not the point ! what if all these things are somehow connected ?
i went to see prof. roth ! you know , i had another one of those dreams last night . i saw tommi !
where have you been all day ?
why not ? she can guard the house . by the way , i gave her a name : clara .
do n't tell me you 've made friends with that wandering flea circus ?
no , thanks . i have everything i need . drive safely , you hear ?
hey , you 're still here . i suppose you like it here with us .
yeah ... i have to go to town .
so , did you sleep good ?
come on , at least try one . it took me two hours to make these .
now , what did i do to deserve this ?
come on , this is n't about honesty . you just need a good night 's sleep . the way you toss and turn all night , even i hardly get any sleep .
well , apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you . do n't you remember what we promised to each other ? honesty - trust !
you know , it 's not always easy for me , either . but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis .
martin , it 's not funny !
someone from the village .
who was that ?
if we stand a chance at all , it 's only by sticking together .
maybe different . i do n't know , ellen .
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before ?
so do i , believe me .
i miss tommi so much .
and two months later , we got married . and all because of one sentence : `` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
i was so excited about meeting you . again and again , i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you .
not a book fair . i was signing autographs in a department store .
cherry-red tears , your first book . i read it at least nine times . and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair .
what ?
cherry-red tears .
we just have to make a new beginning .
i have a funny feeling . do you think we 'll get over all that 's happened ?
hey , take your time . you know time heals better than any shrink ever can .
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it .
i just had a really strange experience .
is everything alright ? are n't you feeling well ?
making our very own solstice fire .
what are you doing ?
well , if you wo n't let me smoke grass , then at least i 'll go get myself some cigarettes .
where are you going ?
yes , daddy .
hey , flower child , the sixties are over . and this stuff is hazardous to your health .
my father was a pilot . and do i know how to fly ?
my father was an electrician . already forgot that ?
you ?
i 'll do it myself .
do you have a better idea ?
are you crazy ? that costs a fortune !
we 'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning .
look at this ! we 'll have to fix the whole wiring . this stuff is dangerous as hell .
in the cellar , i think . wait , i 'll take care of it .
do you know where fuse box is ?
oh , damnit !
hey ... the fuse .
we 're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity ! damned box !
maybe the antenna 's broken .
oh , that was upstairs . a real antiquity ! i think it 's great .
i mean the armchair !
it still worked in town .
what kind of a horrible thing is that ?
well then , i guess i 'd better leave the two of you alone . but do n't forget ...
oh , the muse ... we 're still having our differences . you know how it is with women .
me and the muse , of course . how is your book coming along ?
they say it 's fantastic . at least that 's what i read in a men 's magazine . so who are the two lucky ones ?
so , how does it feel to be kissed by two women ?
you 'll never get away from me !
stop that !
oh god , tommi ...
ellen , move aside ...
what else should i do , damn it , he 's dying !
you 're not a doctor , you 'll hurt him !
i have to cut his windpipe ...
`` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
say it anyway . come on , how much do you love me ?
come on , say it . you know ...
why else ?
i do n't know all about what happened back then . but it always stood between me and my husband .
but what is the truth ?
that 's alright . do n't misunderstand my husband . it 's only that he 's already had enough problems with this case . and who would believe him if he told the truth ?
thank you . elisabeth , i did n't mean to ...
frank kosinski . here 's the address . go see him . ask him .
oh no , no . you 're not bothering him . he has lots of time since he 's been retired .
i really hate to bother him , but ...
thank you .
oh , ellen ! i 've been wondering when you 'd come . why do n't you step in .
you 're doing fine , are n't you ? i mean ... the two of you alone in that house , so far out in the moor .
ellen .
i appreciate your concern , but we live in that house . i need to know what happened in there .
do yourself a favor : do n't ask .
1976. what happened back then ?
you know , after doing that job for so many years , you learn to appreciate the simple things in life . flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life . but certainly , you 're not here to chat about my hobbies .
wait , wo n't you join me for a cup of coffee ?
i guess it 's too lonely for most folks . it 's time for me to get going . it 's been a pleasure meeting you .
village gossip . you 're a real attraction here .
do i look like it that much ?
it 's a pleasure . you 're from the city , right ?
ellen straub .
you know , i saw him sitting outside your gate ... oh , i 'm sorry , i 'm forgetting my manners again ! i have n't even introduced myself yet . hi , my name 's lindner . karl lindner .
no , i 've never seen him before .
does this dog here belong to you ?
hello . can i help you ?
we can do all of that later , but first you need to calm down .
it all went so fast . he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver . i only wanted to defend myself . you have to call the police ...
i think i 've killed him . martin , my husband , i 've killed him ! that is , i 'm not sure , but ...
what ?
i 've killed my husband !
mrs. straub !
a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and , thus , influence your perception .
and that is ?
there is , of course , another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case .
listen , it 's one thing to have a guilt complex . but i know the difference between when i 'm overstrung and when i 'm seeing things that are simply not there ! besides , it only began after we moved !
how could i fail to notice that ! - i have to go ...
hammer ?
yes , something was ...
peculiar ? you mean , like back then ?
i think it 's starting again . you know ... there was something peculiar . if only i knew ...
well , it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it .
we should leave the past alone .
you did n't tell her !
excuse us . but do stop by for a visit sometime ! you are welcome anytime .
stop scaring people . let 's go . we need to be on our way .
just call me elisabeth .
oh , mrs. straub . may i introduce you to my wife ?
not so bad , if i could get some peace and quiet around here .
hey , my man ! how 's the masterpiece coming along ?
i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place . you can afford to spend some money . if i was you , i 'd spare myself all the hard work . besides , did n't you want to start writing again ?
twenty-three , to be exact .
i guess someone lost their key . you did get your tetanus shots , i hope ?
look at this . the lock is totally demolished .
very funny .
tenth floor .
damn , this thing is heavy . where do you want to have it ?
ladies and gentlemen : the `` straub country-residence '' .
well , look here !
he was the first man among us . a great light has gone out .
ohwhat have i done ?
and you are a warwickshire shit-house .
you are a gentleman .
thank you , ned .
romeo and juliet -- just a suggestion .
ah
the title wo n't do .
oh
it 's good .
nedi knowi know
the speech is excellent . `` oh , then i see queen mab hath been with you ! '' excellent and a good length . but then he disappears for the length of a bible .
you did not like the speech ?
locked safe in here . i leave the scene in your safe keeping , ned , i have a sonnet to write .
willwhere is mercutio ?
mercutio
and the title of this piece ?
we are in desperate want of a mercutio , ned , a young nobleman of verona
viola de lesseps . known her since she was this high . would n't deceive a child .
lady ?
thank you , my lady !
writer , is he ?
oh , thomas ! she has cut my strings ! i am unmanned , unmended , and unmade , like a puppet in a box .
sir robert de lesseps .
do you know that house ?
i had the christopher marlowe in my boat once .
really ?
yes , i 've seen you in something . that one about a king .
yes .
i know your face . are you an actor ?
right you are , governor !
follow that boat !
treachery !
you did . but ned alleyn and the admiral 's men have the playing of it as the rose .
i gave shakespeare two sovereigns for romeo !
well , i am to deptford now , i leave my respects , miss rosaline .
never !
romeo ? -- he gave it to henslowe .
what is money to me like us ? besides , if i need a play , i have another waiting , a comedy by shakespeare .
twenty pounds on delivery
wait ! will you desist !
then tomorrow you will have the pages .
tomorrow .
you have the money ?
you have the last act ?
my massacre at paris is complete .
what do you want , kit ?
see you in jail .
we will all be put in the clink .
no juliet ? !
we have no juliet !
ask him .
and what favour does mr. tilney receive from you ?
the queen has commanded , she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us .
burbage , i will see you hanged for a pickpocket .
done .
here is two sovereigns -- i 'll give you two more when you show me the pages .
ned is wrong for it .
i swear it . he wants romeo for ned and the admiral 's men .
you 're a liar .
ten pounds .
how much ?
it 's for henslowe . he paid me .
i will play him . bring it tomorrow .
romeo
the title ?
romeo . wit , swordsman , lover .
what is the chief part ?
a comedy . all but done , a pirate comedy , wonderful .
are you writing ?
when i have fifty pounds .
not from me . i only stole it . when are you coming over to the chamberlain 's men ?
i am still owed money for this play , burbage .
there is no dog in the first scene , will kempe , thank you . how goes it will ?
the woman who wears the snake will dream of you , and your gift will return . words will flow like a river . i will see you in a week .
will it restore my gift ?
yet can not love nor write it .
so now you are free to love
four years and a hundred miles away in stratford . a cold bed too , since the twins were born . banishment was a blessing .
no , your marriage bed .
on my mother 's side the ardens
and your relations ?
she had a cottage . one day , she was three months gone with child , so
a woman of property ?
no , no . you have a wife , children
a goodly length in times past , but lately
how long has it been ?
tell me , are you lately humbled in the act of love ?
it is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring .
most interesting .
nothing comes .
interesting .
i have lost my gift . it 's as if my quill is broken . as if the organ of the imagination has dried up . as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed .
i am here to help you . tell me in your own words .
aye , now and again , but what of it ? i have lost my gift .
black sue , fat phoebe , rosaline , burbage 's seamstress ; aphrodite , who does it behind the dog and
and yet you tell me you lie with women ?
words , words , wordsonce , i had the gifti could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires , love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line , i could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now
and buys a deadly poison . he enters the tomb to say farewell to juliet who lies there cold as death . he drinks the poison . he dies by her side . and then she wakes and sees him dead .
that 's me .
i have not said all . by malign fate , the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friar 's plan . he hears only that juliet is dead . and thus he goes to the apothecary .
by heaven , i thank you ! i will be your apothecary !
mr. fennyman , because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play . i am writing an apothecary , a small but vital role .
of course , it was mighty writing . there is no one like marlowe
yes , i saw it .
i saw his tamburlaine , you know . wonderful .
who is that ?
gentlemen ! thank you ! you are welcome .
sad and wonderful ! i have a blue velvet cap which will do well , i have seen apothecary with a cap just so .
well , that will have them rolling in the aisles .
the apothecary ? will , what is the story ? where is the shipwreck ? how does the comedy end ?
mr. shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary !
henslowe , you pound of tripe , in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage , so do n't tell me about business
i want no more trouble , mr. fennyman . as i explained to you , the theatre business
yes , but very well .
but nothing is happening .
very well .
is it going well ?
oh , it 's coming , it 's coming .
where is the play ?
i do n't know . it 's a mystery .
how ?
nothing . strangely enough , it all turns out well .
so what do we do ?
mr. fennyman , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
by order of the master of the revels !
oh , that .
the theatres are all closed by the plague !
what have i done , mr. fennyman ?
this time we take your boots off !
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment .
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughteralmost finished ?
mr. fennyman , i think you may have hit on something .
of course not !
there 's never any
a share of the profits .
but i have to pay the actors and the authors .
good title .
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter .
what 's the title ?
it 's a crowd-tickler -- mistaken identities , a shipwreck , a pirate king , a bit with a dog , and love triumphant .
partners !
and a share . we will be partners , mr. fennyman !
and his ears .
a new comedy . by will shakespeare !
cut his nose off .
it 's a comedy .
put his feet in .
i have a wonderful new play !
take his feet out . where will you get
two weeks , three at the most , aaaagh ! for pity 's sake .
when ?
every word .

i am so sorry , mr. henslowe . i wanted to be an actor . i am sorry , will .
it is over .
nobody knew !
ned , i swear i knew nothing of this !
i do n't know . it 's a mystery .
how will it ?
juliet does not come on for twenty pages . it will be all right .

the show must you know
what do we do now ?
another little problem .
i do n't know , it 's a mystery .
how will it ?
no , it will turn out well .
we are lost .
by god , will , if you do not , who does ? let us have pirates , clowns , and a happy ending , or we will send you back to stratford to your wife !
by god , i wish i knew .
god 's teeth , am i to suffer this constant stream of interruption ? ! what will you do in act two when he meets the love of his life ?
juliet ? you mean ethel .
what ?
the one who came with your letter ?
romeo .
what ? who ?
cut round him for now .
you want to know what parts you are to receive . all will be settled as we go
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day . it does no harm and authors like it .
we are about to embark on a great voyage .
nobody . the author .
we are at least four acts short , will , if you are looking for disaster .
we are at least six men short , and those we have will be overparted , ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews . my romeo has let me down . i see disaster .
tomorrow
well , i to my work , you to yours . when can i see pages ?
i did not .
my tailor . wants to be an actor . i have a few debts here and there . well , that seems to be everybody . did you see a romeo ?
yes . nearly . it 's all locked safe in here . we need ralph for the pirate king . good morning , master nol . you will have a nice little part .
will ! have you finished ?
rosaline ? you mean ethel .
romeo and rosaline . scene one ! god , i 'm good !
is it about a pirate 's daughter ?
i feel a scene coming on .
to the palace at whitehall .
now where ? will ?
to my weekly confession .
where are you going ?
no , then .
cut out my heart ! throw my liver to the dogs !
burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlain 's men . for fifty pounds my hired player days are over .
fifty pounds ? what for ?
mr. henslowe , will you lend me fifty pounds ?
half what you owed me . i am still due for one gentleman of verona .
nobody ! you are writing it for me ! i gave you three pounds a month since .
who wrote that ?
no -- it 's comedy they want , will ! comedy ! like romeo and ethel ?
what piece ? richard crookback ?
well , i am a dead man and buggered to boot . my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks , my company is playing the inn-yards of england , while burbage and the chamberlain 's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece , written for my theatre , by my writer , at my risk when you were green and grateful -
henslowe , you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate ?
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet ?
she is always aphrodite .
who is she this time ? !
as soon as i have found my muse
god be praised ! locked ?
it is all locked safe in here
no , no , we have n't the time . talk prose . where is my play ?
doubt that the stars are fire , doubt that the sun doth move
will ! where is my play ? tell me you have it nearly done ! tell me you have it started . you have begun ?
a different one you have n't written ?
this is a different one .
i thought your play was for burbage .
good luck with yours , kit .
mercutiogood name .
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethel 's brother or something . his name is mercutio .
the daughter of his enemy .
the daughter of his enemy .
do you think ?
ethel .
yes , that 's good . until he meets
romeo isitalian . always in and out of love .
well , there 's a pirate in truth , i have not written a word .
what is the story ?
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter . yes , i know .
and yours ?
good title .
i have a new one nearly done , and better . the massacre at paris .
i love your early work . `` was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium ? ''
not new -- my doctor faustus .
i hear you have a new play for the curtain .
i insist -- and a beaker for mr. marlowe . the barman does the business .
i have . and chinks to show for it .
burbage says you have a play .
wonderful , wonderful .
how goes it , will ?
kit
`` out of her favour where i am in love . ''
`` of love ? ''
`` out . ''
`` not having that which , having , makes them short . ''
it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ? ''
`` ay me , sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ? ''
`` but new struck nine . ''
`` is the day so young ? ''
`` good morrow , cousin . ''
thank you . let go , there 's a good nurse .
god bless you !
i will .
be good to her , my lord !
will you ask her majesty to be patient ? !
be patient , my lord , she is dressing .
not ready ? where is she ?
it would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master .
it would be better that you return tomorrow , my lord .
piety is for sunday ! and two hours at prayer is not piety , it is self- importance !
lady viola is pious , my lord .
two hours at prayer !
you will not tell . as you love me and as i love you , you will bind my breast and buy me a boy 's wig !
my lady , this play will end badly . i will tell .
oh , nurse ! he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lesseps 's dreaming .
he looks well enough for a mountebank .
from tomorrow , away in the country for three weeks ! is master shakespeare not handsome ?
your mother , and your father
a comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of romeo to be the very same capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the pirate king !
verona again .
he sees himself in me ! romeo montague , a young man of verona .
but i would be valentine and silvia too . good nurse , god save you and good night . i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players .
as a nurse .
no . . . not the artful postures of love , but love that over- throws life . unbiddable , ungovernable , like a riot in the heart , and nothing to be done , come ruin or rapture . love like there has never been in a play . i will have love or i will end my days as a . . .
like valentine and silvia ?
all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . lord wessex was looking at you tonight .
i am not so well-born .
playhouses are not for well-born ladies .
be still .
but at the playhouse . nurse ?
when the queen commands it .
but silvia i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?
i liked the dog , for laughs .
did you like proteus or valentine best ? proteus for speaking , valentine for looks .
oh , but they can !
but playwrights teach nothing about love , they make it pretty , they make it comical , or they make it lust . they can not make it true .
above lord wessex ?
and i love poetry above all .
and -- ?
they are not acted for you , they are acted for me .
i love theatre . to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
speak out ! i know who i am . do you love stories of kings and queens ? feats of arms ? or is it courtly love ?
your majesty
what do you love so much ?
your majesty .
i have seen you . you are the one who comes to all the plays -- at whitehall , at richmond .
stand up straight , girl .
your majesty .
give it to master kent . he will see it rightfully home . wessex gives his purse to viola .
fifty shillings . pounds .
lord wessex , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it 's time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
as stories must when love 's denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder .
indeed i am a bride short . how is this to end ?
why , lord wessex ! lost your wife so soon ?
your majesty !
there was a wager , i rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love . i think you lost it today . you are an eager boy . did you like the play ?
your majesty
by and by i come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief . a thousand times good night ! ''
`` madam ! ''
`` i come , anon -- but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee -- ''
`` madam ! ''
`` all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay , and follow thee my lord throughout the world . ''
`` go ask his name -- if he be married , my grave is like to be my wedding bed . ''
`` i know not . ''
i would have made you immortal . tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare .
will !
burbage has my keeping but you have my heart .
are you to be my muse , rosaline ?
you left it in my bed . come to look for it again .
i have lost my gift .
when will you write me a sonnet , will ?
`` parting is such sweet sorrow ''
sam ! do me a speech , do me a line .
it is not my fault , master shakespeare . i could do it yesterday .
luck be with you , sam . sam ?
master shakespeare
master henslowe , you have your actors .
no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away .
but your voice have they dropped ?
i am , master shakespeare .
mr. pope ! mr. phillips ! welcome , george bryan ! james armitage ! sam ! my pretty one ! are you ready to fall in love again ?
`` the exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine . ''
`` what satisfaction can'st thou have tonight ? ''
`` o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes ; and but thou love me , let them find me here .
i would not for the world !
`` she speaks .
`` ay me . ''
`` the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp . her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night . see how she leans her cheek upon her hand . o that i were a glove upon that hand , that i might touch that cheek .
`` sin from my lips ? oh trespass sweetly urg 'd . give me my sin again . ''
`` then have my lips the sin that they have took . ''
`` thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purg 'd . ''
`` oh then , dear saint , let lips do what hands to : they pray : grant thou , lest faith turn to despair . ''
`` ay pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . ''
`` have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ? ''
i like her .
as any mule in christendom . but if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .
is she obedient ?
she will breed . if she do not , send her back .
my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex . is she fertile ?
she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .
yes , i know . but he was always hanging around the house .
but the plague
i have , master shakespeare .
you have opened the playhouses ?
what does burbage care of that ? he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe .
so this is the favour you find in the chamberlain 's men .
like you , i found him not at home !
i have to get back .
wait , you 'll see the cat bites his head off .
oh . what is your name ?
i like it when they cut heads off . and the daughter mutilated with knives .
you admire it ?
i was in a play . they cut my head off in titus andronicus . when i write plays , they will be like titus .
better fortune , boy .
i 'll be damned if you are !
i am ethel , sir , the pirate 's daughter .
who are you , master ?
write me well .
good bye , my love , a thousand times good bye .
nor you for me .
you will never age for me , nor fade , nor die .
i do n't know . it 's a mystery
how does it ?
but all ends well .
and thus unable to declare her love
but fearful of her virtue , she comes to him dressed as a boy
orsinogood name
at sea , then -- a voyage to a new world ? she lands upon a vast and empty shore . she is brought to the dukeorsino .
sold in marriage and half way to america .
an excellent beginning let him bea duke . and your heroine ?
a comedy ! what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom , sick with love ?
the queen commands a comedy , will for twelfth night .
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more , then i shall be the sorrier .
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .
it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .
i am done with theatre . the playhouse is for dreamers . look where the dream has brought us .
a hired player no longer . fifty pounds , will , for the poet of true love .
`` i have more care to stay than will to go . come death , and welcome . juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let 's talk . it is not day . ''
`` thou need'st not to be gone . ''
`` it was the lark , the herald of the morn , no nightingale . look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east . night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . i must be gone and live , or stay and die . ''
`` wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ''
will you read it for me ?
but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows , as solemn as they are unsanctified .
nono .
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare .
you can not marry wessex !
you were not dead before . when i thought you dead , i did not care about all the plays that will never come , only that i would never see your face . i saw our end , and it will come .
oh , my love you ran from me before .
i love you , will , beyond poetry .
i was the more deceived .
calf love . i loved the writer , and gave up the prize for a sonnet .
my love is no lie . i have a wife , yes , and i can not marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps . it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that . and yet you let me come to your bed .
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed .
you lie .
he was not dead before . i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come .
you never spoke so well of him .
marlowe 's touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations .
a literary feud . quite normal .
will ! what -- ?
stage fighting ! oh , will ! as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us , and i will marry wessex a week from saturday .
i know how to fight !
you can not , wessex will kill you
then i will go with you .
you follow your desire freely enough in the night . so , if that is all , to greenwich i go .
to be the wife of a poor player ? -- can i wish that for lady viola , except in my dreams ? and yet i would , if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day .
what will you have me do ? marry you instead ?
you can not ! not for the queen herself !
yes , this is not life , will . this is a stolen season .
in heaven , perhaps . it is not a comedy i am writing now . a broad river divides my lovers -- family , duty , fate -- as unchangeable as nature .
oh , but it will end well for love ?
i found something in my sleep . the friar who married them will take up their destinies .
oh , but it is mine too !
that 's my line !
`` good night , good night . as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast . o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''
yes , some of it is speakable .
oh , will !
i must . i must
oh , do not go
it was the owl . believe me , love , it was the owl .
it is broad day ! the rooster tells us so !
there is time . it is still dark .
oh -- no , no !
let him be damned for his pages !
mr. henslowe ?
oh , let henslowe wait .
it was the owl -- come to bed
no , the morning rooster woke me .
moonlight !
i must . look -- how pale the window .
you would not leave me ?
well perhaps better than my first .
and that was only my first try .
oh
even your play .
there is .
i would not have thought it . there is something better than a play .
it is strange to me , too .
i do not know how to undress a man .
then kiss me again for i am not mistook .
i am .
answer me only this : are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare ?
wait ! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent .
can you love a player ?
can you love a fool ?
oh , not for the world !
you can bring them with a word .
if they find you here they will kill you .
oh my lady , my love !
oh -- i am him too !
alas indeed , for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart .
a lowly player .
oh but why `` alas ? ''
the same , alas .
anon , good nurse . anon . master shakespeare ? !
will shakespeare !
who is there ?
my lady !
killed last night , in a tavern ! come , then , we 'll say a prayer for his soul
he is dead ?
oh ! -- dear god , i did not think it would be me to tell you . a great loss to playwriting , and to dancing .
mourning ? who is dead , my lord ?
and on a day of mourning . i never met the fellow but once at your house .
it is to be expected on a sunday .
i understand of course . it is to be expected .
i am going to church .
bless me , i thought it was a horse .
it is not my riding day , my lord .
you look sad , my lady ! let me take you riding .
lady viola isyoung in the world . your majesty is wise in it . nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting . i 'll wager my fortune .
i meanyour majesty , they do not , they have not , but i believe there is one who can
ah ! my lady ! the tide waits for no man , but i swear it would wait for you !
good morning , my lord !
i will do my duty , my lord .
she wants to inspect you . at greenwich , come sunday . be submissive , modest , grateful and brief .
the queen has consented ?
will you defy your father and your queen ?
it was your eyes . no , your lips .
but why me ?
why , yes ! my fortune lies in my plantations . the tobacco weed . i need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work -- i fancy tobacco has a future . we will not stay there long , three or four years . . .
virginia ? !
how your mind hops about ! your father was a shopkeeper , your children will bear arms , and i will recover my fortune . that is the only matter under discussion today . you will like virginia .
i do not love you , my lord .
your father should keep you better informed . he has bought me for you . he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday . you are allowed to show your pleasure .
do you intend to marry , my lord ?
no . i have spoken to the queen . her majesty 's consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife , and once gained , her consent is her command .
you flatter , my lord .
i am aware of it , but it is beauty 's privilege .
lord wessex . you have been waiting .
my lady viola .
so my lord ? i speak with him every day .
i have spoken with your father .
my lord .
my lady viola .
it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .
oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute !
for one kiss , i would defy a thousand wessexes !
but what of lord wessex ?
yes , by god ! love knows nothing of rank or riverbank ! it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king , and their love should be minded by each , for love denied blights the soul we owe to god ! so tell my lady , william shakespeare waits for her in the garden !
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ?
oh thomas , a pair of pippins ! as round and rare as golden apples !
what of her bosom ?
constantly . without doubt . and plays the lute , she has a natural ear . and her bosom -- did i mention her bosom ?
she sings too ?
deeper . softer . none of your twittering larks ! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song .
and her voice ? like lark song ?
oh , thomas , her lips ! the early morning rose would wither on the branch , if it could feel envy !
and her lips ?
oh , if i could write the beauty of her eyes ! i was born to look in them and know myself .
yes , like rain and sun , like cold and heat . is your lady beautiful ? since i came to visit from the country , i have not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?
like a sickness and its cure together .
yes , my aunt . but perhaps she wept a little . tell me how you love her , will .
your aunt ?
i her letter came to me by the nurse .
no . and yet she does where the ink has run with tears . was she weeping when she gave you this ?
does she say so ?
she loves me , thomas !
it is only ours you can know .
and break her heart and mine ?
if you love her , you must do what she asks .
she tells me to keep away . she is to marry lord wessex . what should i do ?
of course you have not ! i have not written it !
i am very sorry , sir , i have not seen act two .
he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet ! what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet ?
no , sir .
do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
let me see you . take off your hat .
are you mr. shakespeare ?
wait there .
i . . .
where did you learn how to do that ?
my hat ?
take off your hat .
thomas kent . i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player .
your name ?
by god , i 'll fight the lot of you
you are on my ground .
you upstart inky pup ! now i will show you your place , which is in hell !
that dog !
marlowe ? oh yes , he is the one , lovely waistcoat , shame about the poetry .
an insolent penny-a-page rogue , marlowe , he said , christopher marlowe -- has he been to the house ?
a theatre poet ?
there was a man , poet -- a theatre poet , i heard -- does he come to the house ?
a man , my lord ?
is there a man ?
oh , my lord , you will not shake me off , she never needed me more , i sear by your breeches !
on a more fortuitous occasion , perhaps
her chaperone . my lady 's country cousin . my , but you be a handsome gallant , just as she said ! you may call me miss wilhelmina !
are you bringing your laundry woman ?
here we come at last , my lord !
christopher marlowe at your service .
by coveting my property . i can not shed blood in her house but i will cut your throat anon . you have a name ?
how do i offend , my lord ?
i was a poet till now , but i have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the tower .
`` poet ? ''
your idea ? well , that fits . i mean , the two of you , that fits together . i should have seen that long ago .
i bought the tickets . one for her and one for me . it was my idea .
what ?
where will we go ? where will we go ? juliet ?
where do you think you 'll go ?
it 's very kind of you to offer , but --
about the mail --
no , ca n't think of anything else that matters .
but more laughter than tears , i think ? yes . on balance ? i mean , remember that time when -- oh , we could talk all night , but we have to go . do n't we , juliet ?
yeah ?
i mean , we 've had ups and downs , right -- good times , bad times ?
not at all .
for the best . exactly . i would n't want things to end on a downer .
oh , no , no , no . do n't let it worry you . not at all . it 's probably for the best .
no , really , i am sorry , sorry to be ducking out on you like this . i hope you wo n't take it personally .
it 's all right . i 'll forward your mail .
yeah , i 'm sorry , but that 's the way it is .
so i gathered .
you old devil . well , anyway , as you can see , we 're leaving .
yeah , i was phoning your mother .
sex lines ? is that it ? triple x-rated interactive fantasy ? old habits die hard .
except the money .
they know ? so what ? they have nothing , there is nothing , to connect us to that bodies stuff .
they know .
they can know all they like , it wo n't do them the slightest bit of good --
but they know .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'm glad you 're so certain , alex . it makes us feel a whole lot better .
it does n't neccessarily matter . they do n't even know who those people are , and even if they did , they have nothing to connect them with us , nothing at all .
it was n't deep enough . i told you it was n't deep enough , but you would n't listen .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
your friends .
who ?
we just wanted to speak to you .
what for ? what did you want ? the money ? was that it ?
looking for you ? yes .
you looking for me ?
secure it ? what do you mean -- you 're gong to take it to a bank ? you 're not going to take it to a bank ? you 're not going to take it to a bank or what , you want to bury it ? is that it ?
i want to secure it .
if you give me the plate , i 'll eat .
not eating like you used to , that 's what .
not eating what ?
you 're not eating .
nothing .
what 's wrong ?
no , i 'm sure , that 'll be enough .
you 're sure ? there 's lots more .
what ? yes , that 's fine .
oh , that 'll come in useful .
i fitted a lock up there . on the inside .
what 's all this for , more security ?
no , it does n't . i tried to let it worry me but it wo n't . i 've worked on that paper for three years . there is a pensioner 's terror ordeal on page six every day . every day . maybe when i 'm a pensioner it 'll worry me .
does n't it worry you ?
downstairs , i know . pensioner 's terror ordeal : page six .
there was a break-in .
from what ? jehovah 's witnesses ?
security .
what is this ?
i do n't know .
how much ?
i do n't know .
how much did you pay ?
i do n't know .
how much did you pay ?
you think so ?
yeah , but you were good , you were really good . fucking bin-bag ' , i liked that . you were good . you explored your maleness to the full there .
anyway , what i was wanting to say was this --
good luck . i love that guy , but why does he have to follow us around ?
after .
now .
after you drink to love and happiness forever .
i want to talk now .
what 's the problem ?
just stop worrying .
listen , it 's important . we need to talk about what we 're going to do --
not now . i have an idea .
can we talk about something ?
that was good .
yes . now come on , all or nothing .
is this necessary ?
do n't you worry about that .
is that going to be deep enough ?
but not quite .
finished .
look , if i draw the short straw , then i 'll do it , but i 'm not going to do it just because you wo n't .
i do n't know .
take his legs .
i just thought we should discuss it .
family ? family ? friends ? drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups do n't have families , david .
i 'm just telling you i ca n't cut him up .
you 're telling me you want out ? already ? you 're telling me you do n't want the money ? hugo is going off . he smells . the flat smells . we ca n't wait any longer .
i wo n't be able to .
i do n't hear this .
i ca n't do it .
we all are , david , we 're all going to do it . each of us , you , me and juliet , will do his or her bit . is that fair enough ?
you know what . who 's going to do it .
do i ? what ? what ? what are you talking about ?
you know what i 'm talking about .
then what ? who 's going to do what ?
no , not that .
dig the pit , i do n't know .
so who 's going to do it ?
a spade , we need a spade -- i wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we 're going to dig a pit .
now what else ? david i do n't know .
and what about you ?
you call them if you want .
when are you going to let the police know ?
he could n't get his car started .
he 's still here .
all right , then , go ahead , telephone . telephone the police . try again . no one 's going to stand in your way . go ahead . tell them there 's a suitcase of money and you do n't want it .
you think so ?
but do n't tell me that you 're not tempted by it . do n't tell me that you 're not interested . i know you well enough .
it 's asick idea , alex . it 's sick .
i 'm only asking you both to think about it .
you mean immoral .
juliet ?
no .
come on , david .
no .
think about it .
no .
can i show you something ?
i saw my grandmother , of course , but i do n't suppose that counts . i mean , she was alive at the time .
no .
yes or no , yes or no , yes or --
alex , i do n't have the time --
have you seen him ?
no , she 's not in . without waiting for any more , he replaces the reciever and walks to the door , where he picks up the mail . on his way back from the door , david emerges , ready to go to work .
it 's true . a newspaper is paying for all this . a newspaper ...
only on expenses .
why , thank you , david .
he made it clear .
i do n't have time to discuss it now . i do n't care so long as he 's not a freak .
i 'm only asking what you think .
i do n't have time .
about this guy , this hugo person .
about what ?
what do you think ?
discussion group , alex , discussion .
you learn that in your psychotherapy group ?
victory is the same as defeat . it 's giving in to destructive competitive urges .
i do n't want to devalue your victory , but i just want you to know : i was n't trying to win .
i have n't lost yet .
you 're a bad loser .
will you shut up and play .
chess . chess is often used as well .
what ?
in the same fashion as chess .
just serve .
i was trying to educate you .
serve .
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination .
with which of the following figures do you most closely identify : joan of arc , eva braun or marilyn monroe ?
turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no , this is important . leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing ?
or maybe just phone out for a pizza ?
do a little freebasemaybe , from time to time ?
i 'd like to ask you about your hobbies .
all right , just a few questions .
i do n't know -- campbell or something ?
what 's his name ?
well , i 've got this story , it 's really good , i 'm working on , that is good , i feel it could be big , it this , eh , and it 's , you know , it 's incredible . am i right , did you say beyond recognition ' ?
do n't know what ?
i do n't know .
animals involved ? i know , but you need a change . and besides , we 're short .
but there 's no --
well ?
cover it ?
of course you do n't know anything about it . if you knew anything about it , i would n't have to send you over there to cover it .
i do n't know anything about it .
out in the woods . three bodies . decomposed . mutilated . beyond recognition .
tell you what . if you do remember seeing any of these guys , maybe you could give me a phone , on this number , any time you like .
right .
i see .
what ? uh , no , no , it 's a fake . i picked it up in thailand . the second hand does n't sweep , you see .
yes .
just one thing .
oh , no problems . do n't worry .
sorry to waste your time .
that 's all ?
that 's it , then .
no , not any more . i just wondered if it would surprise you .
parked outside ?
what ?
well , is it ?
yes , i suppose so .
and if i told you their car was parked outside , would that surprise you ?
i do n't know them .
take another look at these two .
i 've never seen any of these men before .
well , then ?
no . why should it ?
that 's because he is . does that upset you ?
it looks like he 's writing everything down .
what does it look like ?
are you recording it ?
this is just an informal discussion .
is this being recorded ?
nothing . we thought you were someone else .
what ?
so tell me , cameron , what on earth -- just tell me , because i want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you ?
well , yes .
spacious , quiet , bright , well appointed , all that sort of stuff , all that crap .
yes .
yes . it is , is n't it ? we alllike it . and the room 's nice too , do n't you think ?
oh , yes , it 's great .
and you like it ?
yes .
good . well , you 've seen the flat ?
yes , thanks .
well , cameron , are you comfortable ?
what ?
that 's right .
let him go . let him take it all .
stop him , alex . you 've got to stop him .
no .
do n't you ever stop ?
do n't worry about it . i 'd do exactly the same , but i do n't think i 'm his type .
you must n't take it so badly .
the perfect couple , i should say .
it 's about me and david .
that 's what i thought he said .
it makes us feel a whole lot better .
oh , shut up , alex .
of course , but i think you 'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
we were just sorting things out .
i do n't know . i thought maybe i was --
yes , of course . why would n't i be ?
are you all right ?
as smart as you are , you 'll need a little help .
what ?
alex .
everything . except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place . ok ? that 's important to me . i need to die misunderstood .
everything .
and if it sounds like i 'm being killed , you 'll phone the police , you 'll tell them everything ?
i 'll wait there .
you 'll wait in the hall ?
no , i 'm not frightened . a little terrified maybe . did you see what happened to the last two who tried that ? they went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference , i mean , alive dead dead alive , that sort of thing . it was n't difficult to spot . he killed them both : he cut them up .
you 're frightened .
i refuse .
it 's the only way .
no , definitely not . and that 's that . i refuse to discuss it further .
well , i 'm not expecting anyone either .
are n't you going to answer it ?
oh .
no .
expecting anyone ?
forget it -- he 'll come down .
now you thought of that , not me .
where he ca n't get it ?
we could put it somewhere .
and the money ?
he is n't safe up there . if you really cared about him , you 'd use your influence to get him down , then he 'd be safe .
forget it .
he wo n't do anything for me , but for you --
oh , good .
exactly . now i 've been thinking --
david ?
later . but first -- him .
your painful groin ?
we have to talk .
what are you doing here ?
boy , am i glad to see you .
looking after it -- he 's probably fucking well eating it .
no , but he 's looking after the money , so what 's the problem ?
yeah , he 's got to go to work , has n't he ? you think he 'll come down for that ?
he 'll come down . leave him alone .
he ca n't stay up there .
leave him alone .
because that 's no good . remember , we did what we did , we took the money . it was a material calculation . but what 's the use if it 's underground , or in some funny bank in some funny place ? if you ca n't spend it , if you ca n't have it , what use is it ? none . it 's nothing , all for nothing , if you do that . i did n't get into this for nothing , so that i could have nothing --
i do n't see the point in that .
do n't you ?
you know we 're right .
be like a weight off your shoulders .
once it 's spent you wo n't have to worry about it .
he 's right . you 'd feel much better about it .
you know , you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it . that 's my advice .
i do n't want it to taste different . i do n't know why i bother . is that enough for you ? hey !
it tastes different .
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff .
no , no , it 's different .
is this the same stuff you made last week ?
yeah , you 're making us all nervous .
will you calm down .
then let 's spend some money .
no .
are you all right ?
do n't know . no one said anything . alex rendered speechless with desire . i recall that feeling , from the days when i had such a thing .
who was it ?
hello . hello .
you were magnificent .
well , you certainly had a good look around .
yes , it is . it 's him . cameron , cameron , come on over.yo !
that 's not him .
what 's he doing here ?
no , i do n't .
cameron . you remember cameron .
who ?
look over there . it 's cameron .
it 's not for me . it 's for love and happiness forever .
david , i promise we will . keep him happy .
for ever and ever .
love and happiness for ever .
i want my money back . excuse me .
sshh .
i do n't know why we could n't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being . we could have hid it in the fridge .
stop nagging .
yeah , we do n't want another stiff on our hands . do n't fall through the ceiling . ok ? is he listening to me ?
be careful .
david ?
ok .
whoever draws the short straw does it all . that way , you either do it or you do n't . all or nothing .
and now you tell me .
i do n't want to . it 's different .
but you 're a doctor . you kill people every day .
i do n't thinki can .
i thought we all were .
who 's going to do it ?
is that all ?
unfeasible .
what ?
no , alex . it 's , it 's --
old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story . be rational , please , and failing that be quiet .
thats not a story , alex . it 's a corpse .
it 's not every day i find a story in my own flat .
no.the guy 's dead.what more do you need ?
why not ? what 's wrong , juliet ? are n't you curious ? do n't you wonder what he died from ?
no .
do n't look ?
do n't .
i 'm just looking .
what are you doing ?
what ? what 's wrong ?
alex .
i wonder how he killed himself . i presume that that 's what happened . what do you think ?
did what ?
i wonder how he did it ?
all right . no problem .
yes .
now ?
yes .
you want me to kick it open ?
open it .
so ?
alex , the key is in the keyhole on the other side .
hugo . hugo . sorry about this , but can you open the door ? it 's us , hugo , your flatmates and companions . your new-found friends . he 's not in . he 's left and we 'll probably never see him again .
a blue one , ok. and it 's still there .
i will ask you once more , what sort of car --
alex , how shouldi know ? i 'm just a girl .
what sort of car ?
so what 's wrong with that ?
he 's got a car ?
his car 's still there .
hugo .
david ?
maybe he did n't like us .
so i gathered .
david has n't seen him either .
no . any idea which channel he 's on ?
have you seen hugo ?
no , alex , we do n't really love you .
you see , they do n't really know me .
you 're right .
i think you 're lying .
yeah .
know and love ?
a miserable , burnt-out , empty shell of a -- alex pauses , looks at his drink , then at juliet .
the man we know and love .
-- which is a hack .
-- which is --
what i am .
-- instead of what he is --
it was you , juliet , it was you --
in a moment he 's going to tell he could have been someone --
not usually this drunk .
i 'm not usually drunk .
he even signs them , in his own name , can you believe it ? i 'd sign someone else 's name . i 'd sign his name . if i wrote them , that is . which i do n't .
alex .
aroused and inflamed .
what ? oh , yeah , sure , if you want . i tell you , every letter this guy writes to you is the same : they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography . i dream of your thighs , the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire , while i , aroused and inflamed -- '
so we 'll meet him , then ?
i do n't know . he sounded swedish . do you know any swedish men ? maybe it was just the emotion .
who was it ?
he seemed like a nice guy , alex .
has he tried down the back of the fridge ? i mean , that 's where i normally find things .
-- i 'd be the first topoint that out . in all kindness i would . but , like they say , you know , she 's got to want to change , has n't she ?
-- more than anyone she has ever met . in her whole life .
well , she had problems --
she hated you --
no . be someone else like him . one is enough . and what happened to that girl , that friend of yours , the one that came round . i liked her . i really felt we had something . she could have moved in . we had chemistry .
for the flat .
for my life ? at a discussion group ? i think not .
maybe you should go , alex.you 'll meet someone wonderful .
god , you two are sensitive . all i 'm doing is implying some sort of sordid , ugly , sexual liason . why , i 'd be proud of that sort of thing .
yeah , he had one too many of thise urges . you of all people should know that .
i thought you stopped going .
just serve .
did you know --
ok , so a has left you , b is ambivalent , you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you , i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love .
and when did anyone last say to you these exact words : you are the sunshine of my life ' ?
now , let me get this straight . this affair that you 're not having , is it not with a man or not with a woman ?
when you get up in the morning , how do you decide what shade of black to wear ?
i mean , what are you actually doing here ? what is the hidden agenda ?
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands , do you then summon hellfire ?
really ?
yes .
cameron ?
cameron .
yeah .
can you afford this place ?
well , that 's what i said , is n't it ?
you mean i can have the room ?
it 's ok. there 's no problem .
what was i trying to say ? oh , yes , i think , we think , or at least i suppose we think -- am i right ?
you were going to say something .
what ?
what ?
so , uh ...
yeah , well , that 's what she said . interesting . that 's why you 're here , you see .
i see .
interesting .
that was n't a question .
yes .
you 're sure of that .
no , i 've never seen them .
yeah , that 's right , that 's it .
is this where no one stays ?
someone lost the key .
loks like you had a break-in up here as well .
i do n't know . maybe i 'm a light sleeper .
yes . why do you think you woke and they did n't ?
no , they were asleep . they did n't even wake up .
i doubt it . and these two other people , did they hear anything ?
i see .
take a note of that , mitchell . only three , rather than four . write it down . you can use numbers or words , i have no preference . which are you using ?
yes , absolutely .
how strange . and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information . only three people here . you 're sure ?
no , three . who said there were four ?
we understood there were four people living here . not always , of course , but now , four .
who said there were four ?
two ?
there are only two other people in the flat .
and the other three people on the flat , did they hear anything ?
of course .
well , if you do , you 'll let us know ?
no , nothing , sorry .
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days ?
no , not that i recall , i was asleep .
did you hear anything before he cries ?
so i just heard her cries for help and all that , and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there , so i just stood around really , waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs . and that 's about all , i think . i did n't actually see anything useful , i do n't think .
can we come in ?
of course .
downstairs .
burglary ?
it 's about the burglary .
what about ?
good evening . i 'm detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell . i wonder if we could ask you some questions .
do n't lie to me . do n't treat me like that .
it was n't like that .
but i bet you did n't say you were going to split on him .
that 's right . you 're going to rio . rio de janeiro . on your own . come on , you should know . you bought the fucking ticket .
what ?
oh , do n't be so coy , dear . you 're going to rio .
eh , i do n't know .
and you need your sleep .
yes .
you and me ?
so let 's go .
it was on the television .
we already know . all about it .
i should hope so .
i 'm sorry .
with a face like this ?
i thought you 'd gone to work .
if i think you 're lying --
no one .
who have you talked to ?
no one . i promise .
visitors ? some friends maybe ? someone you talked to ?
no .
were you expecting anyone ? tonight ?
what ?
expecting anyone ?
no , no , no . that 's what you paid for it . two hundred pounds is what you paid for it . we do n't know what it cost us yet , for you two to have a good time , we do n't know the cost of that yet .
that 's what it cost , david .
you paid two hundred pounds for this ?
two hundred pounds .
two hundred pounds ?
two hundred .
that was stressful . i found that stressful .
it 's alright . i think he got the message anyway .
i 'm sorry .
do you think you could be a little more forceful next time ?
yes . they 're my friends .
do you know many of these people ?
no .
would you like to talk about it ?
oh , yes , i 'm fine , thanks , just fine .
are you all right ?
alex , i think it 's time for you to stop .
i 've never seen a dead body before .
yes .
is this what they always look like ?
keep it going , alex . you 're unstoppable now .
just get on with it , alex .
did you ever kill a man ?
it 's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction , afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is , quite simply , just that .
ok , i 'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i 'd like you to name the song , the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band .
look , it 's a fairly straightforward question . you 're either divorced or you 're not .
do you smoke ?
why do you want a room here ?
which is why i 'm trusting you with this account .
oh , i see , i thought you meant --
you get the job done .
i 'm boring ?
and that 's why i think you fit in here .
yes , sir .
oh , it 's unfashionable , i know , but , yes , we 're methodical , yes , we 're dilligent , yes , we 're serious , and where 's the crime in that , and why not shout it from the rooftops , yes , maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring , but by god , we get the job done .
i 'm not sure --
but they sneer , do n't they ?
eh --
there 's a whole wide world out there , and it all needs to be accounted for , does n't it ?
not any real sneering as such , no .
-- is often sneered at . are you aware of that ?
exactly what i was --
accounting , david , chartered accounting --
well , it 's a wide range of , eh --
in this firm .
right here ?
here .
sorry ?
what do we do here , david ?
that 's what i thought .
oh , him . well , he died .
yeah , here , i mean , where else ?
here ? .
that one , last week .
what guy that died ?
that guy , the one that died .
what guy ?
what happened to that guy ?
hello .
no , but like all novelists , i 'm in search of the self .
and that 's not the same thing ?
i write about it ?
you know about it ?
the human condition .
a certain weakness .
for what ?
no . but he needs treatment .
and he 's a patient of yours ?
i 'm a doctor .
working nights ?
no , just leave it . he knows i must be at home . i 'm working nights this week .
shall i answer it ?
it 's an improvement .
a little bit . is that good or bad ?
did he sound upset ?
it was some guy called brian .
all right .
no .
yes , the telephone , but if it 's for me , i 'm not in . hugo you 're not in .
the telephone ? it continues to ring .
do you think you could answer that ?
it 's a breeze .
writing seems easy .
yes , i mean , who wants to read about another dead priest ? it 's about some other guy , some guy who 's not a priest , who does n't die . you see , it 's better already .
no .
yeah . well , maybe i 'll change it .
i see .
a priest who dies .
what 's it about ?
well , i 've been away for a bit , travelling , that sort of thing , and now i 'm trying to write a novel .
what do you do ?
would you like to see the rest ?
it 's nice .
i 'd be delighted .
would you like to come in ?
you must be juliet .
you must be hugo .
well , it 's up to you . seven six five . how will you be paying ?
the first one was fine .
it 's up to you . air patagonia . new outfit : via caracas and bogot . no catering . four hundred and eleven pounds . four one one . good value , but refueling at bogot is variable .
yes , the first one 's fine . heathrow direct .
air france . glasgow . direct , but then you 're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds . that 's nine one two . it 's up to you .
what ?
air portugal , on the other hand , via lisbon , same day , five hundred and sixty-five . five six five . it 's up to you . catering important ?
that sounds fine .
october 15th , direct flight , london heathrow to rio de janeiro , british airways , you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds . seven six five .
and you said you supposed so , but i was n't offering it for debate .
sorry ?
i mean , that 's what it 's like .
i suppose so .
like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
diseases .
and what do you recognize , names or faces ?
yes .
but in your work you must meet lots of different people , every day -- new people , new faces . no ?
same as everyone else .
do you think you have a good memory for faces ?
no . i have n't seen them .
look again if you like .
i 'm sorry , i 've never seen any of them .
take all the time you like , doctor .
or a fake ?
is it real ?
your watch .
one other thing . do you have any tattoos ?
you can tell by the intonation .
it 's like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
offering it for debate .
excellent . dc mitchell is a rising star , mr. stevens . under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade .
both , sir .
well , it 's a small town . sooner or later things catch up with you ... do n't they ?
what 're you talking about , george ?
she 's a very groovy girl . that 's the problem .
then what 's the problem ?
no , it 's a very groovy girl .
do n't you like her ?
i am ... except i 've got ta do somebody at their house .
i thought you were in a good mood .
no .
look , would you argue with your doctor ?
i do n't know , i think ...
it 's great . you wan na speak to mary ? hold on ...
do n't you think there 's too much gold ?
yeah , baby , how 's it going ?
anyway , you remember harold ?
chicken salad , devra !
chicken salad .
yeah , baby . things are great . listen , there 's devra , whatta you want ?
you 're in a good mood today , george .
-- think what you have time to think , lester .
what are you talking about ?
lester , you 're a miserable man . you 're not helping anybody . you 're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business , do n't kid yourself . and you know the worst thing about it , even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i ca n't possibly imagine , you 'll never know the difference . you 're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you 're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she 'll keep her hands off him .
yes and you do n't have to be sarcastic about it , that 's a beautiful thing he 's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at saks --
-- is that what this is all about ?
-- yes , we 're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in , believe it or not .
-- is that right ?
you make me sick . just be straight for once in your life .
that 's okay too .
we can not go into this later .
ca n't we go into this later , sweetheart ?
-- cause she 's going to be very , very expensive .
-- what , who ? oh she 's very nice , yes -- i mean normally -- -
-- i hope you like miss shawn --
yes , sweetheart , shh .
lester .
why would i like to know if there 's nothing i can do about it , goddammit --
i just thought you 'd like to know --
what do you expect me to do about it ?
that girl 's making an awful spectacle of herself .
lester , do n't you think that uhh --
-- yes , senator -- just a minute , dear --
it 's just -- fabulous . think you could do anything for me ?
that 's george .
no , doll , i listen to you . and if a deal loses money that 's not so bad either if it 's handled right .
that you were just indulging me .
what ?
yes , but ... i thought ...
you suggested it , do n't you think it 's a good idea ?
i do n't know . he 's a hairdresser .
maybe he 's too flighty and irresponsible . that 's why i asked if he was a fairy .
why ?
i 'm thinking of investing with him . he worries me .
maybe ... why do you ask ?
maybe he 's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that .
well , i do n't know for sure ... he 's a hairdresser .
that kid ... the hairdresser .
who ?
do you think george is a fairy ?
do n't be silly . i 'll just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints . see ?
holy christ . you want to get us killed ?
sweetheart , it 's a bore out there ... let 's lock the door .
and who 's jill ?
she 's a friend of jill 's .
she what ?
well she ...
why did n't you come alone ? lester invited you . did you have to bring her ?
right now , i just do n't care .
but are n't you ...
no , baby ... i 'm glad you 're coming tonight .
no , that 's okay , i 'll do it now .
comb my hair out later , honey .
hello , george .
hi .
that 's great . you look great , baby , great . dennis , look at felicia 's hair .
i mean it or i would n't say it .
i know .
and i certainly would n't tell lester .
no , i know .
i would n't say so if i did n't .

then it 's not your problem .
no .

i am not like my mother !
that you 're just like your mother .
then what do you think ?
no .
beverly hills hairdresser ... what kind of a thing is that to do ... you might as well be a faggot ... think that 's funny too ?
yeah ...
you live a phony cheap cop-out existence .
yeah .
you think that 's funny , do n't you ?
no shit .
in fact , i do n't think i 've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life .
no kidding .
i never get my hair done .
yeah , it is .
you do n't have to make conversation with me , i 'm not my mother ... do you have a thing about older women ... that 's sort of faggoty is n't it ?
what ?
do n't make conversation with me .
... just , you could look very heavy ...
why ?
i 'd like to do your hair sometime .
making it with my mother ?
am i what ?
well , are you ?
yeah ... i 've made it with a girl ...
i asked you first .
have you ever made it with a girl ?
nothing , i guess ... have you ever made it with a guy ?
what would my being a faggot have to do with that ?
see if you 've been making it with my mother .
why do you wan na know so bad ?
c'mon , tell me . do n't be afraid .
gee , this is great .
c'mon , are you or are n't you ?
... yeah .
well , are you ? are you queer ?
yeah .
did you hear me ?
no thanks .
are you gay ? ... baked apple ? ... they 're cold but they 're good .
no thanks .
chopped liver ?
i do her hair , yeah .
you 're my mother 's hairdresser ?
no thanks .
this is the one thing i like about this house ... want some lox ?
a little .
hungry ?
she 's out , but you 're supposed to wait .
yeah .
you here to see my mother ?
look , mr. roundy , why do n't you make out a financial statement ? it 'll save us both some time . miss michaels here can show you ... have it notarized and we 'll see where we go from there . miss michaels , would you get me a couple of forms ?
i 've got the customers ... that 's my point . i 'm the one they want . if i had my own shop , they 'd leave and come to me . i have a lot of customers .
i mean credit references , mr. roundy .
her hair , i do barbara rush .
pardon me ?
well , i do barbara rush .
what sort of references do you have ?
it 's got nothing to do with inflation . rates , for example , rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully . historically , that 's always been true , though most people do n't realize it .
i guess not ...
after all , mr. roundy , we 're paying six percent . six percent . fha 's at eight and a half -- no , we wo n't be going back to the old days .
they are ?
jesus , look at this . nine , nine and three quarters -- that 's our prime rate . and i 'll tell you something else : the big boys are going for it .
well , yeah ... you know .
you do know what money 's like these days .
right , that 's right .
and you need money ?
right .

oh , by the way , i think you oughta know -- lorna thinks she 's got the clap .
i 'm finished with her .
yes i do .
you really think so ?
no , man , no . you can say everybody 's a whore . she 's okay . i mean jackie 'll fuck around but not that much . somewhere she really likes you , lester , and it 's not just the bread . she 's okay .
just a whore , i go over there , have a few drinks and get my gun off . i 'm through with her , she 's nothing but a whore .
no --
she 's nothing but a whore .
lester , it just happened .
i mean , how did that happen ?
what about her ?
what about jackie ?
i do n't either , lester , i swear to you i do n't .
yeah , , it goes up a little and then it goes down , maybe nixon will do something . what 's the difference , they 're all a bunch of jerks . i would n't let 'em run my business , i can tell you that much . not if i had any choice in the matter . i do n't know what to do with you . i do n't know , i do n't know what 's right or wrong anymore .
oh yeah ...
... you can lose it all ; you can lose it all no matter who you are ... i do n't know , what 's the point of having it all . look at me . i do n't have a goddam thing ... the market 's terrible right now , went down ten points last week , goddam lyndon johnson !
i was gon na give you the money . probably i was . shit , i do n't know , i do n't know anything anymore .
hey , you were never going to give me the money .
me !
who ?
hell of a way to treat a business partner , that 's all i can say .
i 'll have to wash one out .
i know .
you do n't have a clean glass in the house .
okay , thanks .
have a drink .
no thanks .
want a drink ?
well , i do n't know .
oh , fuck , lester , how should i know ?
why , why do you think that is ?
oh , are you kidding , man ? she hates her .
do you think lorna hates her ? i do n't think she hates her . i mean she may resent her a little ...
we 're always trying to fuck them ... they know it and they like it and they do n't like it ... that 's just how it is ... look , it 's got nothing to do with you , man . it just happened . felicia 's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she 's getting older ... her daughter hates her , what 's she going to do , go to pta meetings ?
... yes , i follow your thinking on that .
... how am i gon na tell you what they have against you ? i mean jesus fucking christ , they 're women , are n't they ? have you ever listened to women talk , man ? have you ? well i do , i do 'til it 's fucking coming out of my ears . i 'm on my feet all day , every fucking day , listening to women talk and you know what they talk about , do n't you ? being fucked up by some guy . that 's all that 's on their minds . i 'm sure you 've done something they could get pissed off about , what 's that got to do with it ? all women are pissed off , man , all of 'em . they fucking hate us ! do n't you know that ?
i wan na hear it from you !
did n't they tell you ?
did they have something against me ?
what , do you think i planned it ?
was it me , did you have something against me ?
no , not yet , not yet . you worry about it for a while , i 've been worrying all night , now you can worry .
then do n't ... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you 're gon na do .
that 's got nothing to do with it ... you 're so beyond my comprehension i ca n't even discuss it with you .
i 'm not anti-establishment .
i wan na know your thinking , i wan na know how someone like you thinks . did you think you could get away with it , did you think you could put something over on me ? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people 's backs and taking advantage of them ? maybe that 's your idea of being anti establishment !
what can i say !
i wan na hear about it .
hey , have 'em put me away , or whatever you 're gon na do , okay ? ... i 'm too tired to lie , i 'm too tired to tell the truth ... i 'm too tired for anything .
i wan na hear about it , george .
oh jesus christ .
i wan na hear about it .
i said sit down !
but ...
sit down .
now wait a minute ...
godammit , george ...
well , what ?
yeah , i 'm unhappy with you about something .
look , lester ... are you unhappy with me about something ?
what do they look like ? ...
well ... who are those guys ?
all night .
yeah . how long have you been here ?
you live like a pig .
well yeah , otherwise it just sort , you know , lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
layered ?
this really ought to be layered ...
no it keeps the skin peeling . you 've got to keep the follicles open . you lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that 's how you lose it .
is n't that bad for it ?
well -- i could try . do you wash your hair every day ?
your hair looks -- well fabulous .
well anyway ...
see she does n't drink too much .
-- yeah ?
-- do me a favor , kind of keep your eye on jackie , she 's a little high strung tonight --
son , we 'll do business , i can tell you that .
i do n't know what to ...
it 's a difficult situation , and i want you to know i appreciate it . tonight 's going to be real tough for me --
oh , hey ...
george , i know you have to deal with felicia and you 're caught in the middle , and if you can just bear with me tonight , well , i appreciate the way you 've handled the situation .
i know it , son . but tonight 's going to be even tougher .
... this doing hair it 's ...
i know it , i know it .
it 's nerve wracking sometimes ... women can get you very upset .
you look like you 've had quite a work-out .
that , and ... i 'll be done in a minute .
what about , tonight ?
... she 's very upset ...
that 's okay , that 's okay , just shut the door .
sorry , honey , i ...
i know what you mean .
-- anything , i do n't care what it is , just so it 's something .
oh yeah ?
i wish my son knew what he wanted to do .
okay .
-- maybe you could , on your way , you know , pick up jackie here .
yeah , little election party i 'm giving at the bistro . it 's a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it . we 'll have a little time to talk there .
tonight ?
when ?
when ?
so i 'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject .
oh yeah ? i mean i know .
well , george , you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me , but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people .
oh yeah .
felicia 's really interested in the shop , is n't she ?
sure .
george , could you -- excuse us for a minute ?
who needs that kind of aggravation ? who needs that kind of aggravation at my age ? when i finish work i want to ...
you 're right .
no , they 're a pain in the ass , there 's no way of keeping track of anything . it 's a cash business and you 've got to watch your operators or they 'll steal you blind , am i right or am i right ?
they 're not ?
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into .
thank you .
it 's good you want to do something , george .
after a while that hurts ... does n't it ?
well , george , i invest for a lot of people . i make a lot of money for them . more than they could do for themselves .
i 'm better than the guy i work for .
but what ?
in a way . but ...
but the important thing is you 're successful at it .
yes it is .
it 's an unusual trade .
i see .
oh , well , i went to beauty school ... you know you go to beauty school ... and you get your operator 's license ... and you graduate ... and you 're a hairdresser .
i did n't say it , she did . how 'd you happen to get in that line of work ?
thank you .
she says you 're a fabulous hairdresser .
well , yeah .
felicia says you 're a very good hairdresser .
okay , okay ...

i 'll call you back ...
come on by .
i 'll call you back .
awww --
no .

no .
all right , who 're you with ? jill ?
i ... uh ... i ... uh ... ca n't .

was n't sure it was you .
what took you so long ?
yeah , yeah -- 'bye .

okay .
i told you i get 'scared up here , so if you 're not coming right now ... i 'm not kidding .
what do you mean ?
no you wo n't .
i 'll call you back .
i 'm coming over .
yeah .
you 're home .
somebody 's mother .
what was it , somebody 's daughter ?
i was too old .
and ?
a daytime soap opera .
a soap ?
well , commercials . i read for a soap the other day .
-- well , more than anything else -- -- i 'd like to suck his cock .
yes .
you do ?
well , whatever i am , i think i can get you whatever you 'd like .
sid . you must be a very important executive .
sid .
that 's very sweet of you , mr. roth .
well maybe i can get you something .
oh , dear that 's too bad . -- get her out of here , get her out of here .
-- you phony asshole --
yes , jackie shawn , my wi -- felicia .
jackie shawn .
you know what 's wrong .
hi , doll , what 's wrong ?
c'mon , jackie , i 'm only trying -- george --
i do n't know . why do n't you ask him ?
who 's the guy , george 's boyfriend ?
jesus , she 's my best friend .
does she know about us ?
jill haynes , jill haynes , i 've told you about jill a hundred times , lester , you never remember anything i say .
who are they ?
glad to meet you , jill , mr. pope .
lester , this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope .
george , glad you could make it , son . hi , doll .
because i do n't want one .
why not ?
no .
are n't you going to have one ?
here .
they 're yorkies and they do n't shed .
they get hair all over the place .
you ought to get rid of those dogs .
just a second , i 've got ta clean this mess up or the dogs 'll have it all over the house .
i 'd like a drink .
oh , i 'm sorry .
shut the door , shut the door !
fine .
maybe he ought to go to beauty school . anyway , see you tonight , doll , okay ?
you 're still jealous .
what 's that ?
you 're lying about one thing , lester .
look ... you do well for people , they do n't ask you to stop . nobody wants you to stop making money , doll , not even uncle sam . they all want their share .
you and your touchy investors .
really ? how about starting with tonight ?
it 's very logical , it 's the most logical thing in the world . you would n't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner , and a little conversation and so forth ...
that 's not very logical , lester .
of course not .
so i ca n't talk to some broken down actor , what do you think , i 'm going to tell him i 'm screwing lester karpf !
now listen , jackie , i 'm not jealous of anybody , i just ca n't afford to get caught ... off base .
i 'm not jealous of the dogs .
i 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody , i ca n't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you . you 're driving me up the wall , lester . you 're even jealous of the dogs . i mean i 've got ta have somebody i can talk to .
i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica , what was i supposed to do , hide in the ladies room ? yes , i was talking to him .
then you were talking to him .
steve slutes , and he 's not a boy . steve could n't get arrested as an actor . he could n't get arrested as a boy .
whatever his name is , that actor .
steve ?
my secretary saw you with that boy .
who do you think i was talking to ?
who were you talking to ?
i am ?
i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy , you 're always on the phone .
no kidding ? your own shop ?
george is going to open a shop .
i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood . the guy in the third chair 's dynamite ... nobody much .
is that right ?
well , yes , george is a wonderful hairdresser .
is that right ?
oh , hi , i mean hello , we 've met .
how did you lose that key ? oh , george , this is uh miss -- this is jackie .
the man from sloan 's is coming . i called you about it .
anyway , you 're crazy .
see you later .
fine .
i 'll call you .
that 's right .
oh yeah ?
poster-kleiser .
i have to meet a client ... who 're you dating ?
going for a pony ride at kiddielands , want to come along ?
jackie , what 're you doing ?
hi , leonard .
no , he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- god , it was hot . the wood on the sundeck , everything .
no , it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time ?
well ... i just kept wiping that dish . maybe it does n't sound very sexy but it was .
what did you do ?
-- he reached up and tore them .
did n't you have any panties on ?
-- he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just ... lifted up my skirt , and , you know , right there ...
... mmm-hmmm .
-- well it was very hot so i 'd left the door open and the water was running so i did n't hear him come down the stairs ...
-- uhh-huhh ...
-- i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show ...
-- yesss ?
well , there was this one time --
c'mon .
-- i guess i just blocked it out , that 's all .
-- well -- not going in and out , i do n't mean just that . why are you asking me ? you went with george longer than i have .
-- when you say forty-five minutes or an hour , do you mean continuous time ? just continually , without stopping ?
-- see , i just know that if i go to egypt , well , things happen , i just do n't know what 'll happen to us , he just never seems to think ahead , does he ?
i think you 're going to hit that car in front of us .
what ?
honey ?
i would say so , yes .
quite a while ... an hour , an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that 's quite a while , is n't it ?
it 's been so long i do n't how long ?
well yes -- you know that about george .
he does ?
well ... it 's not so much the number of times he does it , it 's ... he does it for a long time .
what ?
jackie --
how much ?
i 'm exaggerating .
after four years ? no i do n't ... and i do n't know too many girls who do .
well , you know what i mean .
really , jill , are n't you exaggerating just a little ? five times a day ?
-- i guess it 's all got to do with this shop .
five times a day ?
i do n't know . one minute he 's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything 's going to be great and he 's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he wo n't even talk to me . it 's driving me crazy .
-- yeah , honey ...
but you have problems ?
we do n't think marriage is important .
well they are . but we have problems . you say things are great with lester . is he going to marry you ?
i thought you said things were great with george .
well , it 's george .
it must be something .
nothing .
well , what is it , honey ?
-- no . no really .
you 're really a love -- you sure ?
do n't be silly .
jill , you 're a real sweetie pie . you really are . you 're sure you do n't mind ?
i guess not .
face it , you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you 've got to find somebody . face it , time is n't on your side .
george is great but i know what you mean .
i spent three years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . george was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . lester does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ?
i know , i 'm sorry .
jill , i 'm just trying to be helpful .
so what 's your point ?
well , he is .
no , listen . he 's a very good hairdresser .
i 'm not . maybe i am .
oh , honey , do n't be totally naive .
i am ? i mean why ?
a real swinger . he 's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years .
who is that ?
i think you 're crazy . do n't look over , it 's lenny silverman .
i 'm telling you he wo n't know the difference .
-- still -- at least we should tell him we 're going . c'mon .
-- he 'll never know the difference .
we ca n't really leave that poor man here alone .
what 's wrong ?
-- just before i ask you out ? i ca n't do that . let 's get out of here before good old les catches up with us again .
johnny ! why did n't you tell me before ?
those arabs wo n't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes .
you 're kidding .
you 're going .
you 're going ?
two weeks from tomorrow .
now i did n't mean that , you rat .
you mean when are you going to egypt ?
-- so when are you going to egypt ?
of course not .
oh , johnny , mr. karpf needed a ride home and i said we 'd take him . do you mind ?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in .
-- why ?
let 's do that .
well -- as i see it we 've got two choices . we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off , or we can go to my party .
-- oh i do n't know --
-- jackie really should n't drink --
george is a hairdresser , is n't he ?
that bastard .
well did he go in there with jackie ?
i do n't think so .
george ? was he alone ?
then maybe you can tell me why george would be going into the ladies room .
well ... sure ...
this other couple that we 're here with , do you know them very well ?
not with your hairdresser .
getting your hair done ... would you like to go to a party ?
-- oh , sure . a hairdresser . how ... how do you a ... meet a hairdresser ?
he 's a hairdresser .
good for you .
-- no .
what does he do ? is he an actor ?
-- never mind .
i 'm terribly sorry .
my god , did i say that ? i do n't believe it .
johnny !
i see . you mean he just sort of fucks you .
sort of .
-- sort of a boyfriend ?
of course not ... he 's sort of a boyfriend .
is he an enemy ?
well he 's not exactly a friend .
all right , forget this filth . continue about your friend .
... my friend does n't like it here either .
are you kidding ? his hair 's probably the most nutritious thing in here . see , you 've reduced me to eating weeds .
why do n't you ask for another one ?
sure .
oh . thank you .
now i 'm embarrassed to tell you .
go ahead , jill , you can say it .
well , that 's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad .
but why egypt ?
that 's right .
egypt ?
-- just wonderful .
thank you .
gee ... that 's wonderful , jill .
-- yes , jill .
jill .
jill .
what did you say your name was , sweetheart ?
that 's fine --
-- there 's not much room --
-- oh no , honey , i 'll do that ...
-- i 'll get in the back --
sure thing , mr. karpf . c'mon .
-- listen , i wonder if you kids could give me a ride ? i 'm kind of stranded here .
oh that 's no problem . -- take care of this boy 's problem , will you , gene ?
-- his car . they have it blocked .
-- what 's the problem , honey ?
thanks for coming by .
please do n't misunderstand ... i 'd really like to go .
we 'll let you know tomorrow .
john ...
no !
no .
do you have something against traveling ?
no .
are you married ?
no .
do you have children ?
no , it 's not that ...
look , is there somewhere else you 'd rather go ? maybe we can change our location .
three weeks .
no ... how long did you say ?
you seem disappointed .
well ... that 's wonderful -- i 'll stop by there for a drink .
well we 'd love to , but we 're going to another party .
oh , say , how would you kids like to stop off for a drink ?
where to , les ?
call me les .
terrific . now all i have to do is find my car keys .
everything okay , son ?
-- we 're going to be here all night .
no of course not .
everybody but us .
have they sat down ?
i think they 're waiting for somebody to start dinner .
good .
yes , dad .
i love you , danny . i love you more than anything else in the whole world , and i 'd never do anything to hurt you , never ... you know that , do n't you , huh ?
yes , dad .
are you sure ?
no , dad .
did your mother ever say that to you - that i would hurt you ?
what do you mean ?
you would n't ever hurt mummy and me , would you ?
what ?
dad ?
good . i want you to like it here . i wish we could stay here for ever , and ever ... ever .
i guess so .
yes i do . i love it . do n't you ?
do you like this hotel ?
yes ?
dad ?
i ca n't . i have too much to do .
then why do n't you go to sleep ?
no . i 'm just a little tired .
do you feel bad ?
yes .
i am , dad . dad ?
good . i want you to have a good time .
yes , dad .
are you having a good time ?
okay .
how 's it going , doc ?
come here for a minute , first .
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine ?
they had to , in order to survive .
you mean they ate each other up ?
there were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times . they got snowbound one winter in the mountains . they had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive .
what was the donner party ?
i think that was farther west in the sierras .
well you should have eaten your breakfast .
i 'm hungry .
yes ?
dad ?
nothing . there ai n't nothing in room 237 , but you ai n't got no business going in there anyway , so stay out ! you understand , stay out !
mr. halloran , what is in room 237 ?
no i ai n't .
you 're scared of room 237 , ain'tcha ?
room 237 ?
what about room 237 ?
not things that anyone can notice , but things that people who shine can see . just like they can see things that have n't happened yet . well , sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago ... i think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years , and not all of them was good .
well , maybe things that happened ... leave other kinds of traces behind .
well , you know doc , when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind ... say like is someone burns toast .
is there something bad here ?
no , i 'm scared of nothing here . it 's just that you know some places are like people , some shine and some do n't . i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it that 's like shining .
try to think what it was .
maybe he showed me something .
now think real hard , doc . think .
i do n't know .
do they know he tell you things ?
yes .
does your mum and dad know about tony ?
it 's like i go to sleep , and he shows me things but when i wake up , i ca n't remember everything .
how does he tell you things ?
yes .
is tony the one that tells you things ?
tony 's the little boy who lives in my mouth .
who 's tony ?
tony .
who says you ai n't supposed to ?
i 'm not supposed to .
why do n't you want to talk about it ?
chocolate it shall be . come on son .
chocolate .
yeah .
do you like ice cream , doc ?
french fries and ketchup .
you do n't ? well what 's your favorite food then ?
no .
now this is where we keep all of out meat . you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers . you got twelve- turkeys , two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb . do you like lamb , doc ?
oh !
mommy !
danny !
mommy ... mommy ... !
danny , come here !
mommy ...
red rum . red rum . red rum . red rum .
danny . danny , stop it . danny !
are you having a bad dream ?
red rum .
danny ... what 's the matter , hon ?
red rum .
red rum . red rum . red rum .
danny ?
red rum . red rum .
if jack wo n't come with us , we 'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves . that 's all there is to it .
okay , mom .
make sure you come right back , 'cause i 'm going to make lunch soon . okay ?
i wo n't , mom .
well all right . but really do n't make a sound .
i wo n't make a sound , i promise . i 'll tip-toe .
come on , doc . he only went to bed a few hours ago . ca n't you wait till later ?
i wo n't make any noise .
not right now , daddy 's asleep .
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine ?
yes ?
mom ?
no .
i did n't think it was going to be this big , did you ?
yeah .
it 's so pretty .
yeah .
oh what a maze . is n't it beautiful .
yeah .
give me your hand . oh , is n't it beautiful .
okay ... oh !
okay danny , you win . let 's take the rest of this walking , huh ?
and you 're gon na lose . and i 'm gon na get you - you betta run fast ! look out - i 'm coming in close . all right ?
all right .
the loser has to keep american clean , how 's that ?
okay . you behave yourself .
yeah .
danny , come on over here .
yeah .
do n't worry , mom . i know all about cannabilism , i saw it on t.v .
jack ...
hey , was n't it around here that the donner party got snowbound ?
okay , mom .
we 'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel , okay ?
okay .
we 're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then i 'll come back and check on you , okay ?
what about tony ? he 's looking forward to the hotel , i bet .
yeah , i guess so .
yeah , i know . it always takes a little time to make new friends .
yeah , i guess so . anyway , there 's hardly anybody to play with around here .
sure , danny , it will be lots of fun .
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter ?
yeah .
yes , i 'd like you to .
do i have to ?
now i 'm going to ask you to do me a favor , and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day . okay ?
does tony ever tell you to do things ?
to my stomach .
where does he go ?
because he hides .
why not ?
no .
if you were to open your mouth now , could i see tony ?
oh ,
no . it 's the little boy that lives in my mouth .
is tony one of your animals ?
talking to tony .
now danny , can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth ?
mommy saying , 'wake up , wake up , wake up danny , wake up . '
what 's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth ?
yes .
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth ?
no .
now danny , when you were brushing your teeth , do you remember if you smelled anything funny , or saw any bright flashing lights , or anything at all strange ?
well it 's just one of those things . you know ... purely an accident , um . my husband had oh ... been drinking , and he came home about three hours late , so he was n't exactly in the greatest mood that night . and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room ... and my husband grabbed his arm , you know , and pulled him away from them . it 's ... it 's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know , in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just ... used too much strength and he injured danny 's arm .
how did he manage to do that ?
ah he dislocated his shoulder .
what sort of injury did he have ?
no , um let 's see i guess danny started talkin to tony about the time we put him into nursery school .
did tony 's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here ?
tony .
did the appearance of danny 's imaginary friend ... ?
only about three months . eh we 're from vermont . my husband was teaching school there .
have you been in boulder long , mrs. torrance ?
mrs. torrance , most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained . they are brought on by emotional factors , and they rarely occur again .
but eh what was the matter with him ?
oh , yeah . oh , yeah , he seems absolutely fine now , but you should have seen him .
mrs. torrance , i do n't think you have anything to worry about . i 'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny .
thank you .
please ...
yes .
shall we go into the living room ?
great . sit down . oh these marvellous doughnuts , help yourself . coffee will be ready in a few minutes .
sure .
well i 'm going to have some coffee . would you like some ?
it 's okay , really .
well how can i repay you ?
oh i would n't think of it .
you give your word on that do you , mr. torrance ?
there 's nothing i look forward to with the greater pleasure , mr. grady .
i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way , mr. torrance . i fear that is the only thing to do .
for the moment , mr. grady . only for the moment .
your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined , mr. torrance . somewhat more resourceful , she seems to have got the better of you .
just give me one more chance to prove it , mr. grady . that 's all i ask .
will you indeed , mr. torrance .
no need to rub it in , mr. grady . i 'll deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here .
grady ... oh .
it 's grady , mr. torrance . delbert grady .
perhaps they need a good talking to , if you do n't mind my saying so . perhaps a bit more .
she eh ... interferes .
well , he is a very willful boy .
your son has a very great talent . i do n't think you are aware how great it is , but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will .
how ?
a nigger cook .
a nigger !
a nigger .
who ?
he is , mr. torrance .
no .
oh , they 're somewhere around . i 'm not quite sure at the moment , sir .
and , er ... where are they now ?
yes , sir . i have a wife and eh two daughters , sir .
why no , sir . i do n't believe so .
eh ... mr. grady ... were n't you once the caretaker here ?
ah ha , it 's coming off now , sir .
why no , sir . i do n't believe so .
have n't i seen you somewhere before ?
that 's right , sir .
delbert grady .
yes , sir .
grady ?
fine .
wo n't keep you a moment , sir .
awfully nice of you to say . of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree .
that does n't matter , sir . you 're the important one .
yes sir . look um ... i think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen 's room , sir , and eh ...
advocaat is it ?
i 'm afraid it 's advocaat sir . it tends to stain .
hallo , this is dick halloran again . i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel .
good evening . forest service .
all right , sir .
thank you very much . i 'll do that .
i 'd be glad to do that , sir . oh why do n't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes ?
sir , i 've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there ,
good evening , mr. halloran . what can i do for you ?
hallo . my name 's dick halloran . i 'm the head chef up at the overlook hotel .
good evening . forest service .
no problem , mr. ullman . i was just getting to the ice cream .
dick , can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes ? we 're on our way through to the basement - i promise we wo n't keep her very long .
it will be a pleasure . right this way mrs. torrance .
dick , if you 're ready to do it now , i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen , while i continue on with jack .
oh , that 's just great . how do you folks like our hotel so far ?
the torrances are going to take care of the overlook for us this winter .
this is dick halloran , our head chef .
sure .
oh dick , come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance .
sound good to you , danny ?
good .
no , we do n't mind .
well i guess i probably heard you call him that .
yeah . we call him doc sometimes , you know , like in the bugs bunny cartoons . but how did you know that ?
i did ?
doc . you called danny 'doc ' twice just now .
beg pardon ?
well one thing for sure , you do n't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice .
i would n't know what to do with it if i did .
do n't let it get you down mrs. torrance - it 's big but it still ai n't nothing but a kitchen ... a lot of the stuff you 'll never have to touch .
yeah , this is it . how do you like it , danny ? is it big enough for you ?
god . this is the kitchen , huh ?
oh wendy . that 's nice . that 's the prettiest .
i 'm a wendy .
mrs. torrance , your husband introduced you as winifred . now are you a winnie or a freddie ?
nice to meet you .
glad to meet you , winifred .
well , i 'm looking for a change .
well this ought to be quite a change for you .
i 'm a writer um ... teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet .
what line of work are you in now ?
eh - formerly a school-teacher .
pleasure to meet you .
pleased to meet you .
bill , how do you do ?
it 's not a matter that concerns you , mr. torrance - at least not at this point .
i 'm the kind of man likes to know who 's buying their drinks , lloyd .
your money 's no good here .
no charge ?
what 'll it be , sir ?
it 's good to be back , lloyd .
it 's good to see you .
good evening mr. torrance .
hi lloyd . i 've been away . now i 'm back .
women ! ca n't live with 'em . ca n't live without 'em !
nothing that i ca n't handle though , lloyd . thanks .
i hope it 's nothing serious .
things could be better , lloyd . things could be a whole lot better .
how are things going , mr. torrance ?
thank you for saying so .
best goddamned bartender from timbuctoo to portland maine - portland oregon for that matter .
that 's swell . i like you , lloyd . i always liked you . you were always the best of them .
your credit 's fine , mr. torrance .
how 's my credit in this joint anyway ?
now i 'm awfully glad you asked me that , lloyd , because i just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet . i was afraid they were going to be there until next april . so here 's what : you slip me a bottle of bourbon , a glass and some ice . you can do that , ca n't you , lloyd ? you 're not to busy , are you ?
what 'll it be ?
wendy ...
i 'm gon na go now .
wendy ...
i 'll bring back a doctor .
give me the bat .
go away .
give me the bat .
go away .
wendy ...

i 'm not going to hurt you .
stay away from me !
darling , light of my life , i 'm not going to hurt you . you did n't let me finish my sentence . i said 'i 'm not going to hurt you ... i 'm just going to bash your brains in ! ' i 'm going to bash them right the fuck in .
stay away ... !
wendy !
stay away from me ,
i 'm not going to hurt you .
do n't hurt me ! do n't hurt me !
why ?
i just want to go back to my room .
why ?
stay away from me !
have you ever had a single moment 's thought about my responsibilities ? have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers ?
oh jack , what are you talking about ?
have you ever thought about my responsibilities ?
of course you are .
of course i am .
jack ...
as soon as possible .
when do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor ?
yes ...
you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor ?
well i ... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor .
i do n't think that 's true . i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny ... and i 'd like to know what they are .
i do n't know .
you ca n't remember .
i ca n't really remember .
i ...
how do you like it ?
jack !
wendy , i have let you fuck up my life so far , but i 'm not going to let you fuck this up !
jack ...
shovellings out driveways , work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you ?
yes .
you mean just leave the hotel ?
yes .
get him out of here ?
i think he did it to himself .
somebody did that to him .
good .
he 's still asleep .
absolutely nothing . how is he ?
and you did n't see anything at all ?
yes , i did .
you went into the room danny said - to 237 ?
no , nothing at all .
did you find anything ?
which room was it ?
no . it 's the truth , really . i swear it . danny told me . he went up into one of the bedrooms , the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub . she tried to strangle him .
i dreamed that i ... that i killed you and danny .
it 's okay . it 's okay , now . really .
i had ... i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had . it 's the most horrible dream i ever had .
fine . why do n't you start right now and get the fuck out of here , hmm ?
yes .
or whether you do n't hear me typing , whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here , when i am in here that means that i am working - that means do n't come in . now do you think you can handle that ?
fine . now we 're going to make a new rule . whenever i am in here and you hear me typing ,
yes .
and it will then take me time to get back to where i was , understand ?
wendy , let me explain something to you . whenever you come in here and interrupt me , you 're breaking my concentration .
okay . i understand . i 'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and ... maybe you 'll let me read something then .
i 'm not being grouchy . i just want to finish my work .
ah , come on hon . do n't be so grouchy .
what do you want me to do about it ?
yeah . it 's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place . i tell you , when we first came up here , i thought it was kinda scarey .
i love it . i really do . i 've never been this happy , or comfortable anywhere .
it 's really nice up here , is n't it ?
yeah ... that 's all it is .
well , something 'll come . it 's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day .
lots of ideas . no good ones .
any ideas yet ?
oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first .
it 's really pretty outside . how about taking me for a walk after you 've finished your breakfast ?
hmm , nice .
i made 'em just the way you like 'em , sunny side up .
i know it .
i guess we 've been staying up too late .
eleven thirty - jesus !
it 's about eleven thirty .
what time is it ?
good morning , hon . your breakfast is ready .
yeah .
perfect for a child .
god , i 've never seen anything like this before . are all of these indian designs authentic ?
sure is .
uh ... huh .
boy , we must be really high up . the air feels so different .
great . look , i 'm at the hotel and i still have an awful lot to go through . i do n't think i can get home before nine or ten .
hi , hon . how 's it going ?
hi , babe .
well , it 's very ... homely .
yes , very cosy for a family , and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in .
oh ...
i 'd better collect my family first .
oh fine . well in view of all the ground that we to cover today , i suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away .
right there .
oh ... has your luggage been brought in ?
no , my son 's discovered the games room .
good . glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen . is your family having a look around ?
no problem . in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat .
good morning jack . i hope you have n't been waiting too long .
well , you can rest assured mr. ullman , that 's not going to happen with me , and eg as far as my wife is concerned , i am sure she 'll be absolutely fascinated when i tell her about it . she 's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict .
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened .
well , obviously some people can be
well , that is eh quite a story .
shut in together over long periods of time .
the police eh ... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever , a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
well , my predecessor in this job
i do n't believe they did .
i do n't suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 ?
i 'm intrigued .
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job .
great ...
they 'll love it .
how about your wife and son ? how do you think they 'll take to it ?
not for me .
can of itself be a problem .
that 's very good jack , because eh ... for some people eh solitude and isolation ...
five months of peace is just what i want .
well , that just happens to be exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm eh ... i 'm outlining a new writing project , and eh ...
physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation .
well , that sounds fine to me .
... the winters can be fantastically cruel , and the basic idea is to ... to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur . and this consists mainly of running the boiler , heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis , repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs , so that the elements ca n't get a foothold .
well ...
only in a very general way .
oh , it sure would be
do you mind if i ask why you do that ? it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic .
let 's see , where were we ? yes . i was about to explain that eh ... our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may .
susie .
well , if you are going to have some , i would n't mind . thanks .
jack , just make yourself at home . would you like some coffee ?
well , that 's very good time , very good . please sit down a minute .
oh , no problem at all . i made the trip in three and a half hours .
have any trouble finding us ?
nice to meet you , mr. ullman .
very nice to meet you .
oh , well - come on in jack .
i 'm jack torrance .
yes ?
mr. ullman ?
yes .
just like a ghost ship , huh ?
by five o'clock tonight , you 'll never know anybody was ever here .
yes , well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday , but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
it 's amazing how much activity is going on today .
how 're you getting on ?
hi .
hi .
thank you , susie .
thanks .
boy , i bet you we could really have a good party in this room , huh hon ?
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably .
oh , i 'll say .
oh ... well this is our gold ballroom .
oh well he sure did a beautiful job . pink and gold are my favorite colors .
as a matter of fact we eh ... brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel .
oh !
this is the staff wing of the hotel . none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .
all the best people .
royalty ?
even before anybody knew what a jet set was . we 've had four presidents who stayed here , lots of movie stars .
oh well they 're really gorgeous . as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i 've ever seen .
yes , i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs .
oh , it 's beautiful . my god , this place is fantastic , is n't it hon ?
this is our colorado lounge .
fine .
bill , would you have the torrances ' things brought in their apartment .
well , that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first .
eight thirty .
what time does the plane leave ?
jack is a schoolteacher .
fine .
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter . i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through .
how do you do ?
bill , i 'd like you to meet jack torrance .
damn near . now i 'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised , but you two are going to bed . go on , now , scoot .
the moon 's not down yet ...
when me and sissy were kids , we were just like you two .
sure , uncle al .
can i tell you kids something ?
i do n't know . maybe he does n't know , either .
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with ?
jesus .
blue . this blue .
lowe 's car- ?
why has n't he picked up the phone and told constable haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters ?
i do n't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is , jane . because i do n't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair .
if father lowe is an innocent little lamb , why has n't he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him marty 's sending poison-pen letters ?
uncle al-
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ !
you 're a real booger , you know it ?
all except my legs ... i do n't think i can walk .
are you all right , marty ?
jane-
do n't you touch me , snotbrains !
will you ?
please , uncle al .
will you marry me , jane ?
do n't tell me what i have to do and what i do n't , booger-brains .
jane ... you do n't have to do that .
jane , i have to talk to you .
went shopping . why ?
where 's mom ?
marty ? you okay ? you 've just been sitting here all morning .
let me help you up .
yes . go away .
stop it !
what do you expect , when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed ?
mom was really mad at him this time , was n't she ?
it was brady 's idea , jane . honest to god . please take the money . i want to make up .
i do n't want your money . you 're a booger .
a new pair of panty hose . is it enough ?
what 's the money for ?
if you do n't stop it i 'm going to vomit . i mean it .
did he really get his head cut off , dad ? that 's what brady said .
brady 's a booger and so are you !
come on , jane- it was brady 's idea . i could n't stop him .
you always take his side because he 's a cripple ! well , it 's not my fault that he 's a cripple !
okay . have you got enough gas to get home , marty ?
yeah ... but if you hear any more noises , tell your father . okay ?
well , it 's probably nothing . i 'm just spooked since ... you know .
and my dad says it 's kids . but it 's not rats and it 's not kids . it's-
rats ...
rattling . rustling .
what kind of noises ?
i 've been hearing noises in there .
what ?
there 's something else scary .
hey , take it easy . i know how you feel .
i used to see her every day , and she never knew what was going to happen to her , and neither did i ! i mean i know how stupid that sounds , but ...
well ... it is his third .
for getting a divorce ?
glasspack . he said he 'd come over sometime this summer and we 'd soup up the engine ... but now i dunno . he 's getting a divorce and he 's in the doghouse with my mother .
what 's that ?
not bad , huh ? my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb .
that 's what my sister says , too . pretty soon i 'm going to start checking the mirror to see if i 'm turning green .
you booger .
then i 'd have to kick your ass , dear boy . go on , now .
what if i say no ?
i know what i said , marty- but it 's ten past one . he 's not coming .
but uncle al ! you said-
i suppose so . you kids ought to go up to bed .
yeah . really . the bitch of it is , we still are . learn from your elders , dearies .
yeah ? really ?
will you do it ?
dear boy , you have gone right out of your mind .
i think he 's going to come for me . not just because i know who he is , but because i hurt him . only i do n't think he 'll try again as lowe .
the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit . a french jesuit .
no one knows how cancer begins , either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it .
marty , the moon was n't even full !
i saw what i saw .
you 're not going to let it go , are you ?
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet .
and what do you suggest i do about it , dear boy ?
mr. haller said he 'd check him out , and guess what ? no one sees him again !
no .
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down ? you do n't think that was a dream , do you ?
it could have been anything , marty .
there ! you see !
no ... but i found some blood , smeared on a tree trunk in that grove .
i told you !
after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder , i did . he 's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all .
shut up , dear boy- no gloating allowed .
i told you !
well ... it 's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws . also , i checked on the otic solution . it was counter brand . no prescription needed .
when he was a werewolf . yes . right . jesus . jane , you do n't really believe this madness , do you ?
i did n't shoot him when he was a man . i shot him when he was-
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn ? he 'd either be in the hospital ... or dead .
marty , do you see your suspect ?
i 'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription . and i 'll bet you another quarter he has n't said anything to mr. haller .
watch it , dear boy . i think it was a hallucination . probably a broomstick , or something .
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face .
you want to know what i think ?
what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed ? you know who used to have a baseball bat like that ? mr. knopfler ! he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade ! jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick !
i do n't know . but i know you did n't see any werewolf the other night , marty . you had a dream , that 's all . an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what 's been happening in this town .
well ... was it a prescription ?
marty , marty , you should hear yourself !
it wasn't- i 'll bet you it was n't . because to get a prescription he 'd have to see a doctor .
what the hell does that matter ?
was it a prescription ?
i called peltzer on my way over here , marty ! father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution . that 's a fancy way of saying eyewash . he 's got a corneal inflammation .
it came for me ! i shot it in the eye ! now he 's wearing an eye-patch !
you 're welcome a million , marty . stick 'em in the bushes for now .
thanks a million , uncle al !
a tracer . you 'll like it .
what is it ?
save this one for last .
yeah ... sure .
one of the reasons i love you , marty , is that you 're almost as crazy as i am . please do n't set off anything that goes bang tonight , okay ? just bright colors . can you tell the difference ?
yeah , i know . it 's great !
stay near the house , for christ 's sake- someone 's killing people . i have to be out of my mind to be doing this , you know .
yeah ! what is it ?
now i said i had something for you , as i believe you will recall .
good .
sure .
i know you do n't . but i want this to be our secret . you get that , do n't you ?
i do n't get you .
it goes fast , all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast , marty , i will have a new job . singing soprano with the vienna boys ' choir .
it really goes fast . thanks , uncle al .
you gave me a heart attack , marty . i 'm dying . i hope you 're happy , because you are looking at a dying man .
we 're gon na find out . take it down the road a ways and back . be careful .
do i need one ?
you got a pilot 's license , marty ?
wait , dear boy . just wait . hand me those pliars .
what ?
yeah , winesburg , ohio , was never like that ... but i got something that just might cheer you up .
uh-huh . only in her case i guess it would be queen shit of turd mountain . hand me that adjustable .
she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue . jane 's walking around like she 's king shit of turd mountain . like always .
your mom 's not around , is she ?
but you are , you know- you are my dear boy .
do n't call me dear boy .
i 'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives , dear boy- they 'll be interested to hear that .
well ... i like it that you always know how to say things , uncle al .
it 's just an outward symbol of everything that 's inwardly wrong in this town . not bad , huh ? i read sherwood anderson in college . i can jive that shit all day .
yeah , okay , the fireworks . jane thinks that 's all i 'm mad about , but it 's not . them doing that is just a ... a ...
and the fireworks . hand me that box , marty .
it is n't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady . now he 's got them to cancel the fair .
a bunch of men getting ready to pretend they 're clint eastwood ... marty , did n't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies ?
what 's going on at owen 's , uncle al ?
what if it 's some kind of monster ?
huh ?
uncle al , what if it 's not a guy ?
well , i 'm not sure that was . christ ! they better get the guy .
no .
there 's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick . you ever hear that one ?
yeah .
you all right , marty ?
let the boy finish the game , nan .
mom- !
piss on him . piss on all the red sox .
okay , okay . dwight evans .
ralph houk ! you ca n't bet a manager ! stone the crows !
i will- be good , kids .
if you keep doing that , you 're going to bump your head , sissy . give my love to mama- tell her i 'll see her thursday .
you kids go to bed on time ! you 've got school tomorrow !
we wo n't !
and do n't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come !
-and babcock , i remember . now go on !
remember , al ... we 'll be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night ! or at the funeral parlor . it 's stickney and-
see me around to my car , marty , and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long .
so have i , actually ... i wish it could always be like this .
yes ... you 've always been that to him . but if you ca n't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home , you better just stay away .
i come here because marty needs a friend .
really ?
i must tell the cardinal . i.11 send him a personal letter , describing your efforts , your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive .
perhaps .
i ca n't wait until next sunday , when the choir performs again . did you see the people walk right in from the street ? that music , that heavenly music -- it called to them .
well ... thank you .
i have n't enjoyed mass this much in years . what a marvelous program . innovative . inspiring . you are to be commended .
oh ?
reverend mother , i just wanted to congratulate you .
i said i was a nun , not an asshole .
what about crack ? you a user ?
okay , so maybe i 'm a nun -- so , you want to ask me something ? you want to listen , for once in your little lives ? you want to pay some attention ?
yeah , you learned a whole lot , i can tell .
yeah . we all got caught . shoplifting . cuttin ' school . cuttin ' up some bitch with a blade . so we got ta come here . so we 'll be good , in the future . so we 'll learn valuable lessons . and i learned mine . i will be incredibly good , i will never rip out nobody 's nose-ring by accident ever again . can i go now ?
well ... yes . yes it is .
yeah . sister mary pat was discussing it . you know she thinks it 's a sin .
really .
yes i 'll sing and know joy evermore
sing !
and i 'm tearful !
sing !
but i 'm fearful !
sing ! sing and your spirit will soar !
were you tempted ?
sing !
he 's so fine ...
yes , mary ?
he 's ... dreamy . he 's ...
i think they hear you !
let thy spirit
you know what we 're saying !
let thy spirit
let thy soul be healed
you know , i just might !
let thy thoughts be guided
i think i hear it !
by a voice you hear from on high
but how ?
let thy soul be healed
what you say ?
let thy thoughts be guided
you know it .
hey , sisters . are you going in there ?
how are you doing .
just tell him , i do love you , but i ca n't -- i 'm a nun .
what you do ?
hey , i know , it 's hard . but do what i do .
no , but ... i do n't know ... sometimes .
and you listen to that ?
well , what about the sex stuff ? what if some dude is after you , and he 's always saying stuff , commin ' on sweet and mellow . like , oh , baby , you know you 'll love it . oh , baby , if you loved me , you 'd stay .
probation ?
'cause we love it so damn much . and cause we got ta come here . probation .
excuse me -- just what are you all doing here ? at sunday school ?
well ... because it 's in the bible . `` thou shalt not ... '' thou shalt not .
how come ? sister ?
we were talking about the wild thing . teen promiscuity .
so , hi there . i 'm ... sister mary clarence . and you 're ... young christians . i guess i should assign you this passage . what 's good ? what were you talking about ?
that ... thing . that nun thing . take it off .
what ?
okay , christy -- strip .
you can handle this .
what ?
mary robert , do n't panic . remember what we talked about ? experience ?
yeah , right to the cops . no way .
with love .
his ashes ?
then stop trying to memorize it . hit the road .
you ai n't got nothin ' i ai n't seen .
what do you want ? this is a private area ! get lost !
that used to be true , vince . i was with you . but something happened . and i 'm different now . real -- different . i 've had , well , you might call it -- a religious experience . and i 've got just two words for you . and those two words are ...
i was good to you ! you re nothing but no-talent garbage ! you 're a two-bit tramp !
joey -- do it .
right here . let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this .
i feel sorry for you , vincent . and i forgive you .
she 's afraid . come on , tell the boys you 're afraid .
i am sorry for all my sins . and yours .
what , vincent ? this is me , doll . i know you . what did you think you were doing ? running to the cops . hiding out . no , no . you 're sorry now , are n't you ?
good evening , vincent .
babe , what happened here ? look at you .
right . yeah . forgotten .
and to say you 're sorry . about this afternoon . and the things you said . forgotten . completely . do you understand ? forgotten .
sure .
is that why you came up here , christy ? to thank me ?
thanks . a lot .
yes ?
no ... it 's fine .
you lying sleazeball ! the best years of my life ! what am i , garbage ? am i lint ?
babe , it 's not me ! i love you ! it 's god !
you pig !
we can still see each other . just like always . it 's a different kind of sin . smaller .
you bastard !
you want me to go against a priest ? get excommunicated ? you think i 'm nuts ?
what ?
he said that if i got a divorce i 'd burn in hell . for all eternity .
you said that ? and what did he say ? did he say you could leave her ? did he say we 'd be happy ?
for the first time in i do n't know how long . i wanted everything done right . open and above board . i told father antonelli i was in love . i told him it was a special love , for all the ages .
you did what ?
i want us to be together . like people . honest , decent people . in the eyes of god . babe , today ... i went to confession .
today was the deadline , vince .
how did i get so lucky ? what is it now , five years we 've been together ? who do i thank ?
vince ...
you are so damn sexy .
who ? the other woman . your wife .
what did who say ?
come on -- stay . just a little . we can talk , i 'll get a pizza . pizza in bed , we 'll have fun . and you still have n't told me what happened . what did she say ?
wish he was mine . that handsome boy over there , the one with the wavy hair .
d00-lang , doo-lang , d00-lang .
he 's so fine .
yes , betty ?
he 's so dreamy . he 's like ... a greek god . he 's the cutest guy here . he 's boss . he 's fab . he 's ...
oh my !
look at that . get a gander .
what is it , betty ?
oh my !
oh-huh .
this prom is a real drag .
yes , betty ?
oh , girls .
were you wicked ?
sing and the devil will flee !
pay attention ...
but then came an angel who whispered these words
what a shame !
damnation was all i could see
it 's true -- i know her .
my soul was in danger i 'd fallen from grace
get moving . i 'm right behind you .
hurry , sister !
this is so exhilarating ! all week long , i ca n't wait till sunday , when we sing .
jackpot ! two buckets
that man -- who is he ?
what is it , mary ?
and we know that , even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite , the lowest slug of humanity ! we know that deep down inside , you 're probably even worse . and so you truly need our prayers .
we know you do n't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors . we 'll pray to find you some honest work .
because we 're
spring is here the sun will shine i 'll be his and he 'll be mine we 'll love until the end of time and we 'll never be lonely anymore
so use it . when we sing hymns , they 're usually about rejoicing , right ? celebration . most music is . so do n't hold back . let all that joy go right into your voice . make me happy . let me hear it . perk out . perk down .
all right , i am , i know it ! all my life , i 've just been ... upbeat . optimistic . perky . i ca n't help it . even when i was little , i remember my mother used to say , `` that child is pure sunshine . she 'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess . ''
am i ?
hold it . mary patrick , you 're a pretty cheerful person , are n't you ?
the dixie cups ? oh my . i was just a girl . of course . spring is here the sun will shine
mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups ?
it 's a rhythm section . the beat .
i know . it 's ancient .
that machine .
no way . we 're a choir , right ? headliners . the big room . two days a week wo n't cut it . every day .
two days . an hour or so .
the goods . the sound . the sale . let 's rearrange a few things . mary patrick , you re not a natural soprano , you 're an alto . get over here . mary robert -- with the sopranos .
chops ?
you see ? we 've got the voices . they 're just allover the place . i 've heard all of you , in the shower -- you 're decent . better than me . we just need charts -- harmony -- chops .
mary clarence , could you ? mary lazarus , you 're terrific , but ... could you help us ?
hold on .
sure is ! come on in , and sing a spell .
is this ... choir practice ?
i love my heddles . show me again .
shuttle , beat , shed . and watch your heddles .
you betcha .
just about . show me again .
is n't it lovely ? now i 'll demonstrate , and then you can hop right in . you just draw your beater in , keep it pressed against the pick , and open the shed . then pass your shuttle , beat , and open the next shed . shuttle . beat , beat , shuttle , beat , shed . keep tension on the warp . is that clear ?
oh , right . at my old place , we used to ... wash cars . groom dogs . so ... nice loom .
mary clarence . goose . we 're completely self-supporting . like all convents . like yours .
but do n't you get money ? from the vatican ?
to sell , of course . i hate to say it , but we 're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine 's . we need a new roof , the furnace is going , and there 's no money .
why ?
well , it all comes back , in just a jiffy . i 'm working on a wall-hanging , of the convent .
not in years .
the minute i saw you . i said to myself , she 's a weaver . have you ever used a loom ?
no . hey -- he knows that you been creating now you 're gon na get a beating
1961 ? '62 ? mary clarence , that 's when many of us took final vows . it 's the last secular music we recall .
i have n't heard that song in ages . the ronettes ?
where did that come from ?
right .
is n't it a glorious morning ? good morning , mary clarence . sleep well ?
sing !
just sing !
you re okay -- for a civilian .
hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one . why do i suddenly feel like snow white ?
you know ? about me ? about everything ?
van cartier .
that 's true , would n't that be great . of course , we never know when things are going to change . any one of us could be transferred to another convent , tomorrow .
we could cut a demo . look for a label .
well ... see , at my old convent , i was n't always ... real popular . i was sort of selfish and ... not real helpful . okay , i 'll say it -- i was n't much of a nun . but now , thanks to all of you ... maybe i 'm shaping up .
is there any syrup ?
what ?
she 's a pro .
again !
babies
amateurs 2
hopeless i
right , right , cross with the left , spin and turn !
do n't look at your feet , and i do n't want to see anybody counting . make it look easy . again !
tell me about it .
it 'll be hell .
a bunch of real mama 's girls .
wet behind the ears .
i do n't know . mary lazarus , what do you think ? they 're pretty raw .
i hear you . how many days a week do you rehearse ?
of course . i 'm a nun . four popes now . the lord hates a loafer .
mary lazarus , i get the feeling that you like discipline . hard work .
i knew that .
yeah , for one second . that was the blend -- you 've got to listen to each other . be a group .
mary robert .
very nice . sisters , have we learned our lesson ? i wo n't hold this little episode against anyone . i 'll try not to .
you 're a ringer . she brought you in to replace me . out with the old .
what ?
free-lance ? oh really ? you think i do n't see ? you think i took vows yesterday ? i know what you 're up to . you and reverend mother .
sure . kind of ... free-lance .
um , i do n't really know this one ...
mary clarence , are you with us ?
whatever .
soprano or alto ?
you know that song ?
shirelles .
i like my old convent , in vancouver . out in the woods . it was n't all modern , like here . no electricity . cold water . bare feet . those were nuns . it was hell on earth , but i loved it . this place is a hilton .
like this place ?
progressive convents . vanity . it sounds awful . it sounds just like this place .
what ?
enough jabber .
which convent ? it was , um , the little sisters ... of the moonlight . in vegas . everybody used to come to mass . frank . dean . sammy . right at ringside .
he said , sing the devil away !
what did he say ?
but the lord came to me
do n't you know it !
i was hell-bound , yes that 's what they say satan was waiting
it 's true !
i was downhearted
bless you .
mary clarence !
she 's got nothing to do with this . let her go .
but what do they want ? where are we going ?
again ?
run ! take off !
they 're from my old convent .
wait , this is n't the way . who are you ?
right to hell . just kidding . where is that bus ?
the council of cardinals ! i 'm so nervous ! what if i forget the words ?
oh no . we 'll always be together .
are you leaving us ?
a thank-you ? for what ? you 're the one we should be thanking .
it 's contraband . do n't ask . but i wanted to give you a treat . a sort of ... thank-you gift .
we 're nuns !
yes , prayer is the answer , and prayers free we 're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house .
honor thy mother and thy father too do n't kill , do n't steal , it 's bad for you
we 're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit , now do your part
give me a c. a c !
i do n't want to mess anyone up ...
mary robert , i 've watched you . you never really sing . you whisper . nothing comes out .
what ?
now stop that . you did n't shoot at me . you were only trying to help , to give me experience . i tried to explain that to reverend mother , but -- i do n't know if she understood .
mary robert , i am so sorry about last night ...
we could have been killed ! but you saved me ! thank you , mary clarence !
i do n't know , some people just do n't like nuns . i wish i had a ruler .
what was all that ? who was that man ? why would he shoot at us ?
experience !
oh my lord !
mary clarence !
goddamn it !
keep moving !
mary clarence !
well , you know , you do n't have to tell her everything . i mean , nothing really happened . we just ... took a walk .
i ca n't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences . i 've learned so much .
honey .
mary clarence ! you 're so ... different from the other sisters . sometimes , well ... sometimes you sound more like a layperson .
good point . especially that dude you were with . i 'd like to see him down front .
those people are wonderful ! why do n't we ever see them in church ?
you watch yourself !
i 'm getting experience .
this is your neighborhood . your turf . you should get to know 'em .
who are all these people ?
really ?
initiation . you understand . later on , we make her wear her underwear on her head .
i have to do this . so i can become a nun .
right .
experience ! right ?
bobs
it 's part of st. katherine 's new community outreach program . how old are you ? you should n't be smoking . have you ever seen a diseased lung ? hand 'em over .
we need experience .
now you .
mary clarence !
are you sure ?
we must ... get you some experience . we must ... leave this place .
of course ! we must do it ! it 's the will of god ! what is it ?
we must do this sacred thing , mary robert .
reverend mother says you need experience , right , in life . in order to make a responsible decision . this is going to be very painful for me . you know how much i love this little room . this whole convent . wait .
what ?
well , then there 's only one thing to do .
she said that ? reverend mother ?
she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i 'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .
she wo n't ? why not ?
oh . mary clarence , i 'm so unworthy . i want to take my final vows , i would do it tomorrow , but reverend mother wo n't let me !
excuse me ?
no , you do n't understand -- i do n't want to get out ! i want to get in ?
right , sure , but what 's the problem ? are they keeping you a prisoner here ? do they drug you ? did reverend mother like , kidnap your parents ? we can call the enquirer .
you have to help me
yeah , like a learner 's permit , right ? when do you hit the big time ? you know , when do you take the final vows ?
a novice .
three years . a rookie .
three years . sister .
so , bob , how long have you been in ? st. k 's ?
right . okay . bob . nice to know you .
mary robert . i 'm ... mary robert .
thanks . so which one are you ? sister bruce ? sister doug ?
an extra heel of bread . please take it , you need your strength . you 've been working so hard .
a cigarette ?
i ... i brought you something .
what ?
i ... i ...
what ? what does she want now ? i did the dishes . i oiled the pews . i dusted the hymnals . two hundred hymnals . why ca n't people share ?
five a.m. ?
it 's after five . we have to bathe .
what ? what time is it ?
come on , we 're late .
do n't push it .
really ? and maybe shorter habits , and women priests , and sleeping late ?
perhaps not . perhaps we can all use ... a little spandex .
what about me , reverend mother ? i think you were right . i 'm just a bad influence . sister show biz .
you have evidenced great maturity , mary robert . we shall have a serious discussion .
i do n't think so . what about skydiving ? a crank call to billy graham ?
very well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you .
then i guess you 're stuck . life sentence . no parole .
i 'm a christian .
you saved my life .
oh ?
reverend mother -- thank-you .
saving you . move !
what are you doing here ?
good day .
but ...
i am sorry , mary clarence . i seem to have misplaced my tambourine . good day , mary clarence .
okay , so i just got things started . but you could build on that . you could keep it going .
you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how ... fortunate .
a part of what ? mary clarence , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party .
but everything that 's happening is good ! you can be a part of it !
indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing .
but -- there 's so much more to do right here . and look , if it 's about me , i mean , i 'm gone .
i must go where i can be of use .
but -- why ?
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara . privately . i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible .
what ?
really . well , that makes two of us .
hey -- your prayers have been answered . i 'm leaving . in just a couple of days .
you have a phone call .
you sent for me ?
the majority has spoken .
but ... wait a minute ...
of course . mary clarence , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program ?
a vote ?
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote .
is n't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals ?
the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church . they command the utmost respect . your more ... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place .
what do you mean ?
and on such an occasion , i feel a completely traditional program will be best .
and i am refusing . as of tomorrow , mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir .
please let me try . i 'm begging you .
out of the question .
hold on . that 's not fair . i worked hard with them . they gave up their free time , and they loved it . those women are happy . and we can get even better . we can wake this place up .
through blasphemy ? you have corrupted the entire choir !
exactly . people like going to theaters and casinos . but they think church is for grandma -- we could change that . pack the joint .
and what next ? popcorn ? curtain calls ? this is not a theater . or a casino .
i was thinking las vegas . get some butts in those seats .
the choir , mary clarence . go for the gold .
not the choir , please , anything but that . the choir -- i mean , have you heard them ? i 'll do anything , scrub floors , toilets , you name it , but not that i
you 're my olympic event .
no . no .
you will sing , and you will sleep , ' that is your schedule until you depart . as almost no one attends mass , you will be unable to cause further damage .
you have , i believe , some minimal background in music . therefore , you are to join our choir .
what ?
you may stay . but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task .
i am ?
mary clarence , perhaps you are correct .
but you ca n't kick me out ! guys want to kill me ! you 're a nun ! a big nun ! are n't you supposed to have compassion ? for the wayward sheep ? i mean , i 'm a major sinner ! all-time great ! hall of fame ! are n't i , like , your dream come true ? your olympic event ?
clearly , you have learned nothing . and you present an ongoing threat , both to this convent and to yourself .
a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
mary clarence , i have given you every opportunity . to change . to make a decent life for yourself .
i know ! i 'm sorry i did n't mean for it to happen ! and i was the one they were shooting at !
mary robert 's life was in danger ! your behavior was inexcusable !
look ... i know i should n't have , i 'm incredibly sorry about mary robert , i was n't thinking , i did n't know that would happen !
i do n't believe we have anything to say to each other .
so ... hi there .
look , this is n't my kind of thing ! i was n't cut out to make little tapestries , or knit little sweaters ! i do n't do that ! i 'm a star !
months of work , and the loom , absolutely ruined !
i 'm sorry , i 'm not a weaver !
good . mary patrick , i need you in the office . mary clarence , carry on .
really catching on .
how to put it ... ah , of course , mary clarence . `` no pain , no gain . ''
in english ?
do your recall the words of saint peter , in ecciesiastes 1:27 ? he spoke unto a wastrel youth . he said , `` take up thy task , and know ye the path of contentment . ''
it never solves anything .
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
sometimes it 's not enough !
we are nuns . we seek solutions through prayer .
have you been out in those streets ? do you know what those kids are up against ? you should help them !
this is a convent , not a clinic . we offer moral guidance , not hardware .
those girls were asking questions . they 've got it rough . i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age . i wish somebody would talk to me about it now .
a balloon and a banana ! tell me , mary clarence , what were you thinking ?
mary clarence !
deal with it , sweet thing . it 's important , nowadays . you just practice at home , with a balloon and a banana .
come , sister .
i got it .
girls , this is sister mary clarence . she 'll be minding you until sister mary patrick 's return . mary clarence , please assign a biblical passage . do not attempt discussion . am i understood ?
yeah ?
from all i 've heard , just about everything . your singing career seems all but nonexistent , and your married lover wants you dead .
what 's wrong with my life ?
i 'm sure . if i were you , i would use this time , to think about my life . and its direction . or lack thereof .
wait . no . you 're kidding . lights out ? at nine ? my day 's just starting .
it is nine p.m. pleasant dreams .
right . so what do we do now ? ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?
your cell is more than adequate .
oh , i do n't know ... satan ?
and whom would you call ?
it 's like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?
useless distractions .
right , sure thing . but what about , like , appliances ? like a little color portable ? boom box ?
our lives are simple . we have little need for material possessions .
you were right the first time . is this like , solitary ? the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?
your cell . your room .
my what ?
this shall be your cell , mary clarence .
that 's tomorrow ! do n't you have any snacks ? machines ?
yes . until breakfast .
is this all the food i get ?
no food . not until sundown .
no food ?
a fast . to remind us of the poor , of those who must endure without enough to eat .
a what ?
as a new member of our order , i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast .
until sundown .
silence ? no talking ? all day ?
surely you are familiar with this practice , mary clarence . only when our lips are silent , can our prayers truly be heard .
a what ?
sisters , for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence .
i 'm outta here .
and the vow of chastity .
like to who ?
the vow of obedience .
no problem .
the mary is in deference to the holy mother , the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola . there are three vows that every nun must accept . the vow of poverty ...
mary clarence ? like a guy ? like a dumb guy ?
as of now , and until you leave , you are sister mary clarence .
but look at rites look at this ! i 'm a nun ! i 'm invisible ! i 'm a penguin !
normally dressed , you are a sore thumb , and you endanger us all . while you are here , you will conduct yourself as a nun . only i shall know who , and what , you truly are . you will not disrupt the convent . you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk . you will draw no attention to yourself in any way .
no ! no ! i ca n't do this !
can do .
excused . open the cabinet to your left . you will find appropriate attire .
would you like that ?
how about a robe ? one of those big terry cloth jobs , with like embroidery on the pocket . `` guest of st. katherine 's ''
deal .
before we do , you might like to freshen up . and you 'll certainly want to change
cool . is there a menu ? or buffet ?
of course . but it 's almost lunch .
fine . got it . look , the way i see it , i 'm stuck here , right ? i mean , i 'm here or i 'm target practice . so here 's the deal -- i do n't bug you , you do n't bug me . i 'll catch up on some sleep , watch some tube , lay back and lay low . so just get me a key and show me to my room , and do not disturb . capisce ?
check your driver 's license .
what 's a concubine ?
absolutely not . i mean the wicked . the heedless . and their las vegas concubines .
you mean black people ?
and all those like you .
are you talking about me ?
i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . spandex . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
what ?
it has come to pass .
your cigarette -- out .
what ?
miss van cartier .
what ?
sit down .
you see ? you see ? i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call . do n't you get it ? i 'm in a convent ! you 're a nun !
i see .
beats me ! what do you think ? smoking ! heavy petting , without a chaperone . heavy petting , with the chaperone . and wearing a black bra , under my uniform . the demon bra .
the reason ?
i was expelled ! when i was fifteen ?
you were unhappy ?
parochial school . akron . st. android 's .
st. anne 's ?
oh my god . this is n't happening , tell me this is n't happening . it 's a nightmare , i 'm back at st. anne 's !
very well .
that 's my real name ! currently i 'm a singer . sort of .
enough joking .
christy . christy van cartier .
your name ?
mother theresa . gandhi . do n't you understand ? this is all a mistake . i 'm the good guy . i 'm the witness . and i 'm being punished !
what is your full name ? your christian name ?
a convent ? they put me in a convent ? what 's the problem ? was n't there any more room in hell ?
yeah , like what ?
i do n't know . there 's only one way to be absolutely sure .
yeah , eddie , thanks a whole bunch . thanks for sticking me in a convent . so you think , after all this , maybe i really am a nun ?
that depends . sisters , you do n't know this , but reverend mother 's been making all sorts of noises about resigning . that 's bad news . i do n't know if we could sing , if we thought that was true .
do n't you have a concert to go to ?
even nuns have to pee .
what 're you doing ?
nuns ?
you do n't get it ! it 's a big thing for them , it 's like ... caesar 's palace . prime-time . they 're singing for the cardinals . it 's like ... `` star search . '' if first prize was a trip to the vatican . they 've worked really hard , they deserve this .
they need you ? a bunch of nuns ? for what ? moral guidance ? make-up tips ?
that 's not the point ! they need me !
i think they 'd understand .
eddie -- i 've got to go back . they wo n't sing without me . i 'm deserting them .
you 're gon na be singing for st. peter if you do n't get your ass out of here !
i 've got a show -- at st. matthew 's cathedral . we 're singing for the cardinals .
what ?
i ca n't go with you .
long story . his goons will be here any minute . we 've got to get you out of here '- now !
how ?
vince knows you 're here .
i know , i know . i 'll be careful . i 'll try .
just remember - you 're a target . do n't you think vince has a t.v . ?
i 've got to go .
you re sort of ... radiant . your eyes are shining . you 're rea1ly different ...
i have ?
no . most of the time i 'm thinking about you . and now ... you 've really changed .
you 're not ... seeing anybody ?
me too .
well.. thanks . i 've been thinking about you.. - sometimes . i mean , there are n't a lot of guys around here . i mean , sometimes i feel like ... a nun .
no -- worried about you . personally .
you mean -- worried about my testimony ?
i 've been worried about you .
really ? lieutenant ?
yeah . you look ... great . i mean it..
i am ?
jesus , look at you you 're glowing .
i know that . this is n't about me . it 's about the choir . you should hear them . they 're good . really good . and i taught them .
listen to yourself . this is n't a career opportunity .
i really ca n't talk about it now . the place is packed . sro . i 've got a show to do .
you 're supposed to be hiding out !
it was n't my fault ! they just showed up . it 's helping the convent .
what if i was vince ? you 'd be dead right now . what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?
eddie ! you scared the hell out of me !
go in and talk to her . it ca n't hurt . go .
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime ?
she 's counting on it . she 's concerned for your safety , but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you . or a carnival .
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?
you blew it -- big time . she does n't want you back .
what 'd she say ?
do n't call again . it 's not safe . i 'll be in touch .
do you hear that ? that choir ? eddie , in here , that 's what they call music !
but it 's a nightmare ! mother superior is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture !
i just need a few more weeks ,
you son-of-a-bitch !
keeping our witnesses alive . we hide them , but there 's a leak in the department , and they end up dead .
like what ?
calm down . look , i did n't want to tell you this , but we 've had some problems with our protection program lately .
but i 'm going insane ! all these people do is pray and work , work and pray ! i do n't get it -- when 's the weekend ? they have gruel , eddie , that 's what they call food ! gruel -- it 's like alpo for nuns ! i sleep in a cell , on a board , and i pray five times a days do you know what i pray for , eddie , do you have any idea ? check your crotch , eddie -- anything fall off yet ? get me outta her !
not again . you ca n't keep calling . somebody 's going to catch on to where you are .
eddie , you 've got to get me out of here .
pray .
i ca n't stay here ! i 'll crack up ! eddie , what am i gon na do ?
everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent . nobody knows you 're here but me . we 're trying to get a quick court date . a month , maybe two , tops . i 'll spring you as soon as i can .
but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they 'll be looking for me !
and one bullet . that 's all it 's gon na take .
with nuns ? with rulers ? no way . i 'm gon na go back , work things out with vince .
it 's a convent . all you have to do is shut up , behave yourself , and get along .
nuns , eddie . there are nuns here . everywhere . it 's crawling with 'em .
safest place in the world . you think vince would look for you here ?
i hate you . i totally hate you .
i 'm gon na put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you .
what 're you gon na do , put me in a bag and bury me ?
no nothing .
okay -- no limo .
jesus , what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune ? let me spell it out for you . you have to hide like you do n't even exist . you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight .
maybe hawaii .
okay , here 's what i want . i know about this stuff . a five-star hotel . with room service .
get a stenographer .
all right ! i get the picture ! i 'll do it ! i 'll testify !
you 'd lose . you 'd die . all over the sidewalk . and into the street .
ten flights ?
then-you run .
and if i do n't ?
screw you !
he did n't do you a favor .
i do n't know anything about bodies ! i mean , he did n't bring it home . he was good to me ... sometimes . he was sweet . he took care of me . who am i supposed to go out with ? he owns a casino . he let me sing .
i never said he was an altar boy , okay ? but he sent his goons after me ! they tried to kill me ! i 'm not kidding !
you could n't believe it ? vince the prince ?
right between the eyes ! down and out ! the guy was gone ! i ... i could n't believe it !
think again ! and get out of here .
information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
when are you gon na get off my case ? have you got a search warrant ? what do you want -- cheap thrills ?
a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?
he 's a businessman .
oh , yeah ? well , how do you think i felt ? you were singing in bowling alleys back then . i told people you were a hooker !
'cause you 're always out , arresting people . making trouble . i do n't know why i went out with you in the first place , it was embarrassing ! i could n't hold my head up , i used to tell people you were a security guard !
so i do n't shop .
yeah , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?
i used to buy.you , ..stuff . on your birthday . when we were seeing each other .
at least he 's not a cop . at least he can afford a decent gift .
from vince ? what a guy . doo-lang , doo- lang .
but -- wait .
really .
people throw stones . they call me names . i mean , really .
oh-huh .
jerusalem is a real drag . everybody hates me .
hail , mary .
hey , girls .
i would n't even tell the pope .
you wo n't even tell us ?
where 's who ?
vince is getting desperate . where is she , eddie ? where 'd you stash her ?
jesus . data-base hoods . it 's a wonderful world . beloved daughter missing . reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . please find our adored angel , we miss her so . dead or alive .
they open a window .
then one day they find you .
a hiding place .
we could put you into our witness protection program .
i 'm telling you !
a nun ?
that she 's a nun ! that chick you 're looking for -- she 's a nun !
we did n't tell you what ?
but you did n't tell me !
we 're the guys from vegas . you had christy last night , but you let her get away . it 's upsetting .
who are you guys ?
i 'm sorry -- i do n't know what gets into him .
you found him -- but we 're not open yet .
we 're looking for mike .
she 's a broad ! got it ! just some broad !
but , boss -- she 's still , you know , a nun .
where is she ?
joey ?
willy -- hit the lights .
i ca n't see anything in here !
which one ?
there she is !
which one !
get her !
maybe pants .
i 'm telling you , she 's not a nun ! get her out of the nun outfit , and put her in some clothes .
so , take it off .
right .
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot .
it did n't work , vince .
well ?
yeah ...
i ca n't believe this . okay , i want both you guys to go back there , and both of you shoot her at the same time .
it did n't happen .
but , vince , how do you know she did n't like , join up and become a nun when she was in that convent ?
what 's the problem ?
not ... totally .
it 's done ?
you know so much . they 've got christy , and we 've got to find her . get her 8x10 , from in front of the lounge . fax it to every contact we got .
it 's a bluff , vince .
he 's so damn cocky . this is different .
take care of it .
and if she runs ?
maybe .
vince -- is she ... okay ?
she 's praying .
what 's she doing ?
and then we can ice her . no nun , no evil eye .
a sweater .
for like , twelve zillion eternities ?
strip down a nun ? you want us to fry ?
that 's what i figured , too .
i figured if you were gon na , then i would n't have to .
neither did you !
you did n't shoot !
no smart-ass remarks or nothing .
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car .
forget her ! we got the one we need ! step on it !
she 's gettin ' away !
yeah , right -- when i see it .
so that guy in the bar was right ? she 's like ... some kind of nun ?
we ca n't leave it up to the feds !
we 've got to save her !
that should have tipped us .
look what she did with the choir . she made us sing beautifully .
we 're losing it .
we sound terrible we need mary clarence .
dress rehearsal at four , performance at 8:30. sharp .
it should be here any minute .
is it worth it ? a lot of witnesses here .
are you going to shoot us all , tough guy ?
measles .
however , we can also pray for other things .
peace on earth .
all right . it 's a beginning . las vegas , nevada .
she told us about one . the little sisters of the moonlight . in las vegas .
but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun ?
she should n't have come back . she knew she was in danger .
really ...
bless her ! there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve . that 's why many of us became nuns . it 's marvelous , reverend mother .
oh , she 's doing just fine , reverend mother -
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ?
i need to see you , at once . girls , please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments . mary clarence ?
yes ?
sister mary patrick ?
reverend mother , on behalf of the sisters , i 'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine 's .
yes , mary patrick ?
impossible .
not a note .
christy .
mary clarence -- you 're alive !
a benedictine .
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun ?
but how do we get there ?
the little sisters of the moonlight !
and what a lovely name . las vegas ...
it 's so beautiful ...
she 's our inspiration !
well , i do n't care who she is . we ca n't sing without her !
she was n't a nun ?
an ... entertainer ?
yes -- two men -- and they had guns .
you mean -- they kidnapped her ?
we 'll pray -- and she 'll be there .
we ca n't sing without her ! what should we do ?
it 's no use . she just is n't here .
mary clarence ! sister !
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us .
mary clarence , do n't be silly . you 're an example to us all . you 've taught us so much . we 're singing for the cardinals , and then -- who knows ? maybe the choir can travel -- to schools , and nursing homes .
mary clarence -- you should n't have . where did you get this ?
ice cream !
it 's brought people back to the church .
but , reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style .
it 's better than springtime .
it 's better than ice cream .
i 'd rather sing than do anything !
he 's kind .
he 's decent .
he 's not like other guys .
that was exciting !
we did it ! we actually sang a chord !
really , mary clarence ? were you a choirmistress ?
mary clarence has a background in music . that 's what reverend mother said .
which convent was that , sister ?
is this like your old convent ?
since mary clarence came to st. katherine 's , i 've been shot at , kidnapped by mafia hit men , and i 've tasted beer . is that enough experience yet ? for final vows ?
yes ?
reverend mother ?
but where ?
las vegas -- she 's here somewhere .
but ... she was a showgirl . she did n't have an old convent .
she said they were from her old convent .
calm down . think clearly . mary robert , do you have any idea who those men were ?
her whereabouts are unknown , and we must proceed without her . pull yourselves together .
i do n't understand . where is she ?
and you 'll face that danger head-on . as if i could stop you . and you have my complete support in this matter . anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing .
but , bishop , surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood .
i know .
i lied .
st. katherine 's is a benedictine order . you have taken a vow of hospitality . to all in need .
but , bishop ...
your small convent is in danger of closing , reverend mother . the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation .
we 're a small convent , bishop . surely there are ... more appropriate shelters .
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
but she 's been exposed to the underside of life . she is the underside of life .
we can save this young woman 's life , and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture .
absolutely not . i am very sorry , but no .
find 'em !
where ?
okay , so the problem is still the nun outfit , right ?
we both missed .
are you nuts ? she 's not a nun . it 's christy . she 's a babe !
she 's ... she 's a nun .
she 's acting weird , vince . ever since we picked her up .
and who are you to talk ? you were nothing . you could n't even sing . i must have been out of my mind .
i love you , chris . i always will . i gave you so much . my time . my affection . a big-time career . and how do you repay me ? what 's the thanks i get ? where 's the loyalty , huh ? where 's the love ?
she 's a nun , vince .
can you hold ? can you try ?
it 's that call you were expecting , vince .
soon , you gorgeous thing ... tell me ... how lonely ?
she did . bring her back . now . for a talk .
i mean , wo n't she talk ? she seemed kind of upset .
he came to me . he promised great violence . said i should cast you out for my own protection . i must speak honestly . there is no reason to think he will not meet with success .
how did you hear this ?
clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting . this time he is determined to have you forced out , or worse .
sarah has gone missing ... my servant girl . her things are gone . damn it . she has joined the migration out of town . what about breakfast , woman ? or , am i to starve to death ?
um ... i ... i did not ... no . why ?
well enough . your gathering does honor to the deceased .
hail , constable . how are you ?
these woods of yours sound a bit crowded , what with all the witches , ghouls and indians living there .
must have been the redman . a lenape indian lives in the western woods .
who took the meat ?
then , name one person who has seen him with their own eyes .
many have .
excuse me , gentlemen , but ... who has seen this horseman ?
this is not a time for frivolity , katrina , is it ? am i mistaken ?
if we could speak alone .
i say ... if the horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people , he 's solid enough to feel this ...
i hit him square .
you must have missed your mark .
i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing .
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side .
two days ... ? for murder ?
they spend two days in chains .
never . a shoe that size i would have remembered .
you are the blacksmith . ever shod a horse with a hoof this large ?
what the hell are you doing ?
well , unless your name is baltus , you should not worry over mine .
we have n't heard your name yet , friend .
excuse me , miss ... they have a laugh at your expense .
certainly not .
when this cut was made , this person was already dead . this is not lady van tassel .
what ?
no clotting or gathering of pus . no healing at all .
what of it ?
stains of blood .
would you stay , doctor ? i may need assistance .
... help yourself , you pompous ass . i will be in bed .
you will stay at her side ?
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves .
you need rest .
bring him .
you need to sleep .
bring young masbath here .
he is dead . you would be also , if your wound had not somehow shut .
... brom bones ...
keep still , constable . you were half-drowned when they found you .
in time , doctor . soon as i finish .
i do not care . you are welcome to use my work area , but i beg you ... return her to her resting place .
the wounds are the same . cauterized . no chopping or half-measures either . one stroke took the head . have you seen , doctor ... ? even the spinal bone ... sliced as smooth as butter .
a diseased monster .
he is a behemoth .
the lenape . he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time .
what are you spying on ?
we must be a curious sight to him .
this should have bled by the pint . yet , no blistering or scorched flesh . how ... ? whatever weapon was used ... it cauterized somehow ... .
what is that ?
no bleeding .
to place it inside its coffin .
why did you move the body , doctor ?
i was afraid of this .
i say , is there any one person suspect in these acts ?
excuse me ?
an honor , gentlemen . in time i will need every detail of the three murderings you 've had , but , for now , i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be ?
climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find , father . that is the closest you ever come to god .
you can not do this . i am a man of god !
you are so upset now ... and yet , you seemed in such good spirits last night .
he may . but , not soon enough for you , and not on your behalf .
damn you , sir ! god damn you to hell !
wallowing quite literally in blood .
they need guidance .
wallowing in sin and lust ...
i am the lord 's voice in this town .
it is only important what you are . an adulterer ...
are you a deist ? is that it ? a free thinker who does not believe in divinity .
oh ? far as i can tell , a rumor does not travel alone for long here .
no . you will not run me out . no one will believe a word of what you say .
only if i repeat them outside this room . and , i will if i must ... out there , for all to hear . or ... you may speak , as planned . but , you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures .
does that look like an animal hanging ?
for poaching . or , would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost ?
then , you should have left two days ago , because i have men willing to help me today .
your superiors are two days away !
protest to my superiors if you like .
i will not allow it . i will not !
i can not proceed without examining the previous victims .
it is sacrilege !
the heads were not found severed . the heads were not found at all .
all i know is three are slain , their heads found severed from their bodies ...
why not tell us what you have heard ? hmm ? how much have your superiors bothered to tell you ?
well ... that might be ... helpful .
perhaps , i could assist in finding them ?
master hardenbrook ...
damn ... damn ... damn ...
a fine idea .
maybe you should take this .
of course . you want them ... it shall not take long . wait here .
may we look at them now ?
hmm ? see them ?
may i see them , master hardenbrook ?
yes , sir ... but , do you have these ?
i have everything ... last testaments ... birth certificates , death certificates ... deeds .
do you have these persons ' wills ?
when a goblin leaps from the nether world , others follow . poltergeists of the air , water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations !
just a moment ... are you saying it is he ?
pardon me ?
taken . taken by the headless horseman . taken back to hell .
excellent . then , you are excused till morning .
i shall , gladly .
just so . granted . and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place . bring him here to face our good justice . will you do this for me ?
not for lack of trying .
these `` methods '' of yours ... there has been no practical application .
chosen me ?
there is a farming community upstate , constable ... ten days journey north in the hudson highlands . it is named sleepy hollow . within a fortnight , three persons have been murdered there . each with their head lopped cleanly off . the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me , requesting assistance , and now , just this very moment , i have chosen you .
not liberalism . equanimity .
for one who calls himself a federalist , your mouth reeks of republican liberalism .
even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused , often quite literally ?
very few , if any .
but , how many innocents rot here ? and , how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets ?
and , < u > with < /u > disrespect , constable , if jails and courts overflow , it is testimony to success , not failure .
without disrespect , look around you . we overflow . as do our courts .
have they nothing to fear presently ?
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence , but if we were more often able to ensure justice , after the fact , then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement .
must we again hear these heretical rantings ?
i could determine if he were dead < u > before < /u > he went into the hudson .
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health .
there are surgical ways of telling how he died ... by the water in his lungs ...
he drowned . anyone could see .
just a moment ... if i may . it is possible this man was murdered .
it 's not something people speak of openly . she did not remarry .
is that all you say ? look at her .
the widow windsor .
van ripper and his wife agreed to take him . they have children and a good home and good land .
tell me something . what becomes of young masbath ?
no , sir , no . if you ask me , i say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass .
more than enough , actually . i beg you , no more , please .
master crane , sir . i 'm glad we have time alone . you 've been told plenty about the horseman , i 'm certain .
at times i do .
no , you listen ! you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards ...
listen to what you say ... .
i know it .
we are farmers here , not lawyers or bankers , or even constables . every penny we earn comes from what we send down the hudson .
are you saying i should be frightened ? is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck ?
not more than a year ago , a mob hung a man for stealing a horse . for stealing a horse ! and , you dig up our dead .
well ... so much for common sense .
my talisman . it will , protect against the horseman if i show a brave face . but , i can not run . if i run in fear , it is worthless .
what is that you wear ?
believe ?
... found the body this morning . you do believe now , do n't you ?
he would not have gone into the western woods . no sane man would .
why would he flee this direction , with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover ?
and now jonathan masbath .
the van garretts died first ; a man and his son , survived by a wife and two infants . and the widow windsor was next ...
the militia ?
well , constable ... are you aware ... to be honest , you are not what we expected . we sent for the militia .
tired .
how are you ?
i doubt that 's the end .
what now ?
take the reins .
what can we do ?
i know . hold on .
lady van tassel ...
climb up !
i can not . you should not worry . van ripper and his wife will look after you . they will . you will be well cared for .
take me with you . there 's nothing left for me here .
this is farewell .
you do not know all that has happened . you can not understand .
why ... why are you like this ?
nothing . to hell with this place and all the people here .
wo n't you change your mind , sir ? what can i say to convince you ?
i need time for thinking . without you hanging on my coattails for a change .
she 's the one who controlled the horseman , is n't she , sir ? sir ?
things have become complicated . katrina is at the mill . ride ahead , find her and bring her to meet me outside the church . find her at all costs . quickly .
what now ? where is she ?
but , sir ... what books ? where are they ?
fiction plays and novels . baltus does not approve . now , come . it may not be long before lady van tassel returns .
what books ?
it is nothing . she comes to read books , so her father will not find her . it is absolutely nothing .
there are no other doors . this is as far as she could have gone .
no . they are all missing .
something i really wish i had not seen . never mind it . did you find the victims ' loan agreements ?
what was she doing ?
lady van tassel .
i was getting worried . who was it ?
there are none for magistrate philipse either . `` paasch , james '' `` pieter , thomas '' `` pos , william . ''
there is no masbath here . my father 's loan papers are missing .
yes . i rode with him on payment days .
did your father take a loan ?
baltus van tassel .
often in such cases , property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to . and , who in this town is owed a great many debts ?
what does it mean ?
intestate . your farm ... all the farms ... they belong to no one .
in test ... what ?
no one yet , far as i can tell . it has gone intestate .
but , if the farm is not mine , who stole it away ?
only the heirs were killed . proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment .
yes .
and it now belongs to you , according to baltus . i heard him say it .
my father had farm land . it was the only thing we owned of any value .
to discover what might have been taken from those who died , it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place .
what good is this ?
because , i serve a fine purpose alive . it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul . we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted . what was taken from them ... other than their lives ? who benefits by their deaths ?
if someone has the horseman 's skull ... if they control the horseman , then why have n't they sent him for your head yet ?
business , best hidden is hidden best at night .
all i saw was their lantern .
man or woman ?
someone left last night . looked like they headed to the square , but i lost them in the forest .
why this tree ?
we should go .
must be some sort of gateway . but , why this place ... ?
stay back .
what is it ?
good questions , deserving answers , of which we are in short supply .
then , who murdered the old crone ? and why ?
true enough .
well ... i 'm one of the few people who likes you .
you grow sharper by the minute , little man . it boggles my mind , but i begin to prefer your company over all others .
if the crone 's wound bled hard , that means she was not killed by the hessian . someone only tried to make it look that way .
`` let loose his silent shrieking . '' who knows , till we work at it ? i admit not being anxious to find out . `` he who holds the horseman 's desire will guide his reaping hand . '' whatever the horseman 's desire is , other than extinguishing lives .
what does it mean ... climb down to the horseman 's soulless place ?
we are far from the hollow . loath to say it ... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning .
should we go back ?
we should not go much further in this murk .
how could something named `` the tree of the dead '' fail to draw attention ?
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies . to the tree of the dead . maybe we passed it by .
what happened ?
we are leaving .
no crickets or cicadas calling . no bird songs .
i hear nothing .
listen .
what is it ?
witches do not exist . however ...
father said witches live there .
if the western woods are truly the devil 's glen , we will see for ourselves .
now , hold the bowl steady . back to business .
thank you .
i have others . all i need is this .
no , i could n't ...
yes ... i suppose it is . keep it .
it 's spectacular .
not for eating , i assure you . watch here .
what kind of nuts ?
are you familiar with magnets ?
look again .
the western woods .
out there . what do you see ?
it 's payment day . loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month . almost everyone borrows ... for tools or to hire workers .
what is it ?
up .
where are we going ?
his teeth . someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth . the lenape could not have done that for himself . someone out there cared for him .
how could he ?
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth .
we must discover it . the reason the murderer chose these persons .
i 'm sure i do n't know .
what is the common thread between these victims ?
i did not ask you to , did i ?
young masbath , i am sorry for your loss . it is a great and sad tragedy . however ... i can not be the one to look after you now .
i deserve to help you . do n't you see how much this means ? my father ... he ... he was a good man ...
i manage fine alone .
whatever . you still need a second to tend to your things .
i am not here for revenge . i am here to bring justice .
we have no choice .
i ... i ca n't do this .
the blades will carry us to the ground . face front and wait for me .
no . get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump .
quickly , close it .
keep climbing . i will follow ...
ichabod ...
his horse .
what was that ?
he moves too fast .
the church .
i do not know . away .
where are we going ?
speak the words , constable . what is stopping you ? what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality ?
katrina ...
call me a liar , then , and a murderess . say it , out and out .
the name van tassel is blackened . you share that name .
if you think i am behind this , say it .
what would you have me believe ?
yes , i have seen that , and i told you why i hid them .
the loans give the land to your father . it does not matter survivors are still on their farms . they could be thrown off ... tomorrow ... a year from now .
i have not been able to face him yet .
what did he say , katrina ?
he did not do these things . if you knew him , you would realize ...
and , what did he say ?
when ... when you spoke father 's name along with accusations , i could not believe it . i had to hide these ... at least till i could confront him myself .
it was you there ?
i have been reading your journal . i 'm sorry . i found it too fascinating to resist . i rode to catch up with you at the notary , out of curiosity . before i found you though , i overheard what you were said .
come with me .
what is so urgent ?
i 'm drawing bad blood from the wound .
what ... what are you doing ... ?
yes . i did notice that , thank you .
the skull is gone .
why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside ?
he ... he tries to take the heads ... they will not pass .
my god ... what has happened ?
just ... keep where you are .
what are you doing ?
what did you say ?
blood .
but , i am not alone , am i ? i only wished to see what you were up to , and ... to thank you .
a woman should not be out alone in these woods .
i apologize if i worried you .
katrina . why do you follow ?
it is only me .
i ... i do not know . i no longer know what i think or what i feel .
if you want me to go , i will . do you want me to leave ?
memories have come back . i had them forgotten , and wish i could forget them again ... but they are here now . lord , how i hate this place .
she died . her lungs were diseased ... two years ago . what is this about ?
what happened to your mother ? is she still alive ?
no , but ... why do you ask that ?
she is not your birth mother , is she ?
what ?
lady van tassel ... she is your stepmother , is n't she ? she bears so little resemblance .
what has happened ?
no , actually , you were not . every word you spoke had truth in it .
the things i said to you before ... i was wrong to say them .
what troubles you ?
allow me some time . i have spent every hour in the company of others . i need to be alone .
if it had been surgery on a living person , done to save that person 's life , you would not question it . not for a moment . so , let me be the first to tell you , dear girl ... on the other side of these sheltering mountains , a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours . and someday , no matter how much you fear it , that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber .
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it . ca n't you see ? you 'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it .
but , why ? tell me why .
to avenge his father , and the others .
take a lesson from young masbath 's desires , ichabod crane . he follows with you to avenge his father 's death . that i understand . but , what do you want ?
i have no solution for its meaning yet , but i could not just ignore it .
what is it then ? scientific method ? how can any of this matter in the slightest ?
it was not butchery .
and this gives worth to butchery ?
there was no blind stabbing . this singular thrust found its target omnipotently , as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother .
must i hear this ?
the child she carried was eight months grown at least ... near to birthing . the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly .
what are you on about ?
you are not regarding it in full . the widow windsor had been run through by a sword . i followed the bloodless wound , a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes .
i have misjudged you i think . i did not imagine you were so cruel .
no stone may be left unturned . it may appear harsh ...
why would you do such a thing ?
wo n't they still have that justice ? or , was it a vain promise ?
they have done nothing of the sort .
people have put their trust in you .
if these are the random stalkings of a monster , what good am i ?
you promised justice .
that would be a pity . those words might show you something you 've never seen before .
very well . but , it will only sit gathering dust .
i insist that you have it .
thank you . no . here ...
then , i also have a gift for you . true magic which even you will not be able to deny .
if you want . but ...
oh , you are hopeless . may i keep it at least ?
do n't you see why ? look closely a moment . put your intellect aside . ca n't you see what is inexplicable ?
yes , but listen . the illusion is easily explained . the eye retains each image , till they combine . and yet , some would call this toy magic .
you made this , and the drawings ?
he only appears to be inside the cage . the point being ...
yes , he does . may i try ?
here it is . a bird on one side . his cage on the other . now , stare at it . the bird seems to be in his cage .
it would be interesting to find out .
i have had them since childhood . i can not remember what from .
these scars . how did you get them ?
i , um ... i have something to show you , if you have a moment .
you pay great attention to small things . i hide these as i hide all my books . father would not approve , lest it were the bible .
may i ask ... why do you cover your book that way ?
you do not disturb me . please stay . having trouble sleeping ?
you are funny .
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions .
really ? then ... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom , or even in a teardrop ?
there is no such thing as magic .
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic , but not all magic is black .
are you so superstitious ?
not all think it is the horseman . many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons . some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer , offering death as tribute . and , still others believe none of it .
extra ordinary , yes . but first , you tell me about the headless horseman .
i 've read a great deal about your new york city . do be a dear and tell me all about it . sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life .
which may explain his temperament . to have asked twice means the answer was `` no '' at least once .
he has proposed to me twice .
the massive fellow ... brom . for someone you call `` friend , '' he misplaces a good portion of jealousy .
my suitor ?
perhaps it is because your suitor 's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat .
is it me , or are you this nervous around all women ?
it might have been more . might have been positively grand talk .
small talk .
other people ?
excuse me ... i should apologize . i , um ... i ... have no great love of ...
well , i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt , but it seems i 've made matters worse . i 'll leave you to your business .
feel free to form your own opinion . though it appears you already have .
you are horribly old-fashioned , are n't you ?
do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men 's beds ?
did they tell ? it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone . according to the elders , an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken , and spells cast then still linger to this day .
i ... i am looking for baltus van tassel .
forgive me , i did n't know .
yes ... yes . i think i will ...
let her go !
you can not kill what is already dead .
what ... ?
i know you saw me .
it is fine . now , i must ...
look closer . do you have anything to clean it with ?
it appears well . it has already clotted .
very little . i must be going ...
she has taken the last of our grain to be milled . you do have a background in the medical arts , do n't you , constable ?
where ?
no . she has gone out .
excuse me , lady van tassel ... katrina is not in her room .
as my husband says , a wife should be always like an echo , and at the same time , quite unlike an echo . like an echo , she should speak only when spoken to , and unlike an echo , should never try to have the last word , or , at least that is what he believes .
do you know ... i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here .
use caution .
yes , actually .
returning to the western woods ?
it is a prime tenet of science , philipse , that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical .
you said yourself . what mere man could have downed the belltower ?
yes . here ...
van ripper ... do you have a gun ?
turn around . now !
what did you say ?
van ripper , turn the coach about !
i did n't see none .
there was not much blood , was there ?
to the best of your recollection , where did the open wound fall ?
here ... in front of this oak , facing north . horrible ...
i can show exactly .
van ripper . can you show where the body lay ?
close your mouth ! keep silent .
what ... what are you doing ?
you want to see into the nether world ... i can show you . whatever you see , do not move or speak . i will hold him .
can you help ?
sit .
the horseman . yes .
i hear him . he rides to the hollow and back .
leave me . you are not welcome here .
the lenape who lived in these woods ... do you know him ? the redman ? i should tell you ... he has been murdered .
in a way , yes .
you are from the hollow ?
pardon . you did not answer when i knocked . are we intruding ?
this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon . but ... i am not going to kill you . not me ...
no one will believe your lies , whore .
imagine my surprise , finding him on a liason with a common servant . a girl who had apparently become his secret love .
he saw me thrown ... saw the horseman looming over me as i fled . things i wanted him to see . but , as long as i govern the horseman , he can not harm me . baltus did not stay enough to see that . he ran as a coward , unfettered by my fate .
father saw you die .
he rides tonight .
am i ? or , are you and young masbath dead along with me ?
you ... you are alive .
doctor , he is awake .
lay still , ichabod . do not move .
she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession . do you know what confession is ? all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul .
no .
she has confessed .
no , sir , please ... she is innocent ...
she is guilty .
she did not do it ... please listen ...
you do not want to be here . go home to your father .
may i see my mother ?
go home .
goddamnit , scooter , come on . pardon my language , ma'am .
i can go . you do n't have to . you do n't never go .
well , yeah it 's a classic . you know , karl , i got to thinkin ' about it last night and it 's just not christian of me to not let you have a key . i mean you been in lockup so long , you do n't need me keepin ' you locked up . you need to come and go as you please . here , take this key , it 'll get you in and out that back door . them french fries good ?
yeah , that 's a goodun . i believe you did tell me that one before . i 've heard that a bunch . long time ago .
there was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss , one old boy from california and one old boy from arkansas . old boy from california says , `` boy this water 's cold . '' old boy from arkansas says `` yeah , and it 's deep too . '' get it ? that 's a goodun .
i ca n't remember .
scooter , did i tell about the two old boys pissin ' off the bridge ?
karl , they 's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with . now there 's one more thing . the way we lock these doors at night , you ca n't get out . you did n't want to go anywhere , did you ?
wait up , i 'll leave with you and lock up .
all right then , i 'll see y'all later . karl you done a good day 's work . they right about you . scooter , he 's gon na knock you out of a job if you 're not careful . i 'll see you tomorrow .
scooter , let 's me and you go over to dairy queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime .
thank ye .
see there . thinks of the simplest thing first .
hit ai n't got no gas in it .
you done fixed it ? i 'll be damned . scooter told me it could n't be fixed . 'course scooter 's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be . you done fixed it . i 'll just be damned . see you tomorrow .
i fixed it . hit 's a workin ' pretty good .
all right then . i 'll see you bright and early . how you comin ' along on that garden tiller ?

i 'll let you off while it 's still daylight .
all right then .
well , i 'm gon na pay you today for this comin ' week , so you 'll have some walkin ' around money . when you get off this evenin ' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin ' up supplies to have back there . some hard candy and some magazines . somethin ' to keep you busy at night .
they give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose . i spent up some of it on ridin ' the bus and eatin ' french-fried potaters .
you got any money ?
yeah , they 's good all right .
if it works out and all , maybe we 'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to . see you later .
i do n't reckon .
yeah , me too .
i like them french-fried potaters .
we order from dairy queen at noontime usually . we can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little .
i 've tinkered around on 'em a little bit .
they say you 're a whiz on fixin ' lawn mowers and things .
now it 's minimal wage and there ai n't nothin ' but a army cot and a toilet back there .
thank ye .
okay , stop back by . do n't worry about your boy here , he 's doin ' good .
i 'll see you , bill .
sure .
can i see him ?
he 's gone to stayin ' over with that wheatley boy and his mama in their garage . i think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot . but he 's got a key here to come and go as he pleases . everything 's worked out good .
is him stayin ' here workin ' out ?
well , he 's pretty quiet . except for them rackets and breathin ' things he does . ai n't threatened me with a killin ' or anything . but boy you could n't of been more right about him fixin ' things . that son of a bitch is a regular eli whitney on a lawnmower . loves french fries . eats four larges and do n't even so much as belch . i 'm proud to have him .
just thought i 'd check on karl and see if everything 's working out .
doin ' pretty good . got a sick tiller here . what 's got you down this way ?
how are you , bill ?
how 'bout you , jerry .
good to know you , karl .
karl , come over here . i want you to meet your new boss . this is bill cox , runs this place . says you can work here and stay in the back .
well , i 've got a roomful of work for him to do . ca n't get scooter to do any of it .
he wo n't steal . i 'm tellin ' you he 's a pretty good ol ' boy . keeps to himself .
fine with me . if he steals anything , i 'll take it out of your pocket anyway .
he wo n't have anything to do with him . now you say it 's all right for him to stay out here in the back ?
that old man of his still livin ' over there on clark street i believe .
well , i ai n't scared of him workin ' here . you know me . i 'm a church goin ' man . forgivin ' man . when your time 's up the lord 's gon na come git you . you seared of him , scooter ?
he 's a regular whiz at it . that 's all he did when he was a kid .
do n't look much like he could . you say he can fix a small engine like nobody 's bidness .
i remember it real well . cut them folks to pieces . his mama one of 'em .
no , do n't guess i do . scooter , good to meet you . this is him , the one i talked to you about on the phone . now like i said , i 'll understand if you get nervous about it . i 'm not gon na lie to you now , he did get in that trouble but then he was real young .

french-fried potaters .
french fries . i like to eat them pretty good .
what do you like to eat here ?

they was a boy . we made friends .
... on the third day i washed her . she was n't very clean . i got all the right spots . she was the first one i ever kept for any length of time , you see i get bored easily , i have a short attention span . i ca n't say she enjoyed her stay , although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum . i do n't really like people who talk a lot . i like to do the talking . i guess that 's why i 'm so fond of you . you 're so easygoing , although i do sense a little tension in you sometimes . by the way , how was it out there ? did you have any fun ? make any new acquaintances ? tell me what it was like .
catch you later freddy !
you know better than that . we 're on duty . catch me in that camaro next week one night .
we run outta somethin ' to drink . goin ' to the county line . you want to race ?

you 're not stayin ' here tonight . go get sober before you come back . i 'm tired of my child seein ' this . now you get yourself straight or i 'll lock your ass out of my life for good .
you know better than to talk like that when i 'm hurtin ' . do n't make me knock the piss out of you .
this is not your house , doyle . this is my house and i 'll say who stays and goes . you 've got a house , why do n't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it .
i thought i told everybody to get out of my house . that includes cocksuckers and retards . get off your asses and go .
but honey , i 'll be good . i promise . i love you sweetie . i 'm just tryin ' to help these two be part of things .
he do n't want to doyle . do n't go vaughan if you do n't want to . you 'll wreck doyle , you 're drunk .
karl , you better clap your hands or he 'll just keep on .
okay ladies and gentlemen or both . it 's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band . over here on lead guitar mr. randy horsefeathers . come on hit a hot lick , randy . well , come on , y'all are supposed to clap now . come on !

well , it 's on ! we 're gon na rock . linda , call vaughan . tell him to get over here . i 'd like him to be here . i owe him a good time .
you do n't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low .
please do n't . not tonight . i 'm not up for it . they always stay till mornin ' . i 'm just give out , doyle .

you know what , by god ?
he does make some funny noises .
who could eat with him settin ' there makin ' that goddamn racket with his throat .
i just feel sorry for the poor thing .
well , i would n't let it get to you .
see , you made him somethin ' . hey vaughan , i was just goin ' on with you , jokin ' around , buddy .
let 's go , vaughan . frank , we 'll be back in a little while . i 'll bring you back somethin ' . you 're food 's in the oven warmin ' over .
frank , why do n't you go off and play in your room if doyle 's gon na talk nasty .
boy , ai n't you somethin ' else . talkin ' back and everything . it kinda makes me horny when you talk back .
you 're not crippled . get in there and make somethin ' .
ai n't that the sweetest thing . what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin ' around with that fag ?
he 'll be here in a little while , he 's takin ' me to get an ice cream .
you sure are hung up on people bein ' sweet . speakin ' of which , where 's your girlfriend ? i thought he was comin ' by here for something .
yeah , that 's right , frank , you better ask him . i mean , do n't hurt his feelin 's or anything , but it would be good to know . i 'm sure it 's nothin ' . he seems real sweet .
he had of went nuts and did somethin ' . they do n't put you in there for just bein ' a retard . they 's retards all over the place that ai n't in the nuthouse . do you know , frank ?
he 's just mentally retarded , i guess .
i ai n't sayin ' it 's right . i 'm just tellin ' the truth . what was he in the nuthouse for ?
doyle , you 're awful . you should n't be that way .
karl can stay if he wants to . mama said --
now here 's the deal . now that i 'm gon na throw my entire life away doin ' what i want to come live here with y'all , we have to get a few things straight . see , frank , me and you mama would n't have any problems if it wad n't for you . we 'd never have a bad word between us . but since you do exist , if i 'm gon na be here as the head of the household , we 'll have to live by my rules . and my rules are you do n't speak unless you 're spoken to . stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does . you 're a weird little shit . i do n't get you . so wake up . face what they call reality . we 're gon na be a family now . and it 's my family . i 'll be payin ' the bills so you got me . but i ai n't your daddy . you just treat me like i am . i 'm the boss , okay . and the other thing is your friend karl has to go . we ca n't have a normal family with him livin ' in the garage and comin ' in the bedroom at four in the mornin ' with hammers and shit . see ?
well , i hate you , too . no i do n't . i love your mama . nobody understands what i go through . i 'll leave . you bunch of freaks have fun . i 'll call you tomorrow honey . i 'm sorry . you can kiss my ass , really . you ever hit me again you little bastard and i 'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out .
i hate you !
okay , i 'll leave and sober up . everything 's botherin ' me , that 's all . i 'm hurtin ' linda . i love you .
that ai n't none of your damn bidness . besides that 's the way friends do one another . fuck it , i 'm gon na go call 'em . honey , find my guitar , i think it 's out there in the garage with that loony tune .
last time you got mad and run morris and them off and said to stay away from here .
i get nervous , that 's all i know .
what have you got to be nervous about ? you 're a damn kid . you ai n't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time .
do n't talk about daddy . y'all go on to the garage and let me be .
stop it , doyle ! do n't talk about daddy , you hear me !
you be quiet , frank , we 're talkin ' . the adults are talkin ' . were you in the lockup for cuttin ' somebody up with a hatchet ?
stop it , doyle !
goddamnit , i 'm talkin ' to the man . you set right there , karl .
come on , karl , let 's go out to the garage .
yeah , honey , let the kid watch t.v . hell , let 's all watch t.v . like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here .
i want to watch t.v .
you might want to find out . he might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin ' .
i ai n't sure .
no sir 's right . i 'm talkin ' to your mama . this is your mama 's decision , not yours . i 'm lettin ' it go on because she asked me , not you . now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that , 'cause i have trouble eatin ' around that kind of thing . just like i am about antique furniture and midgets . i ca n't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture . same thing with a droolin ' retard .
no sir .
now son , i wad n't talkin ' to you , was i ? was i ?
he 's real honest . he would n't steal nothin ' .
well , honey , i do n't guess i give a shit . i ai n't here half the time anyway . if you want a retard livin ' in the garage , i do n't guess i care . i 've got a good tool box and socket set out there i do n't want stol 'd . i guess i could take it home with me .
i thought i told you to keep out !
i 'm a witness . i heard you threaten her life .
that 's funny . you go to bed and take snot nose with you .
doyle , do n't you lay one hand on her .
i 'll kill you , you fuckin ' faggot ! you mind your own business . now get out ! now , before i get too mad to turn back .
it 's not your house , doyle , it 's linda 's .
we do n't have a goddamn band ! y'all just shut the fuck up ! we do n't need no practicin ' or managers cause we ai n't no fuckin ' band ! morris ai n't no genius and the rest of you are just losers . am i the only one sane human bein ' around here ? just get the hell out of my house and do n't come back !
if y'all do n't shut up i 'm gon na go out of my mind . and plus you 're liable to bust a spring in karl 's head . he 's already off balance .
i do n't really understand the meaning of the words .
what exactly do you mean by that ? i do n't understand .
you got that shit right .
sarcastic right ? you know the boys in the band are probably gon na stay over tonight . we 'd be glad to have you .
oh , yeah , i 'm thrilled .
i bet you like sittin ' between two men in a dual wheel truck do n't you ?
shhhh ! this is the national anthem .
are you sure you can drive ? you 've really had a lot of alcohol .
come on , do n't be a pussy . everybody has to work .
i 'd better go on home now , it 's late . i have to work tomorrow .
you enjoying yourself , karl ?
sure . it sounded like a number one tune all right .
you like that vaughan ?
that 's ridiculous . that 's just a total lie .
i heard you was more than friends . i heard dick rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin ' at it in the same room with poor , little , old mizz ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney .
i know albert . we 're friends .
hey , vaughan , you know what i heard ? i heard you been puttin ' it to albert sellers that works over at the funeral home .
do n't rush ever'body , honey .
sure , i guess .
i aim to kill you with it .
i told you to get away from here , did n't i ? i 'm tryin ' to relax and look at tv . what are you doin ' with that piece of iron ? i swear to god you 're the weirdest son of a bitch i ever heard of .
what numbers do you punch ?
pick up the fuckin ' phone and call 'em , i guess .
how does a feller go about gettin ' ahold of the police ?
where 's ever'body else ? you seen 'em ? i thought i told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway .
you shut up you , fuckin ' retard . get your shit and get out of here . that was a wake-up slap , frank . remember . reality , like i said . do n't forget any bit of what i said to you and we 'll be fine .
do n't hit that boy no more .
baptized ? well , get baptized then . i do n't give a shit . call a fuckin ' preacher , goddamnit ! i ca n't baptize you .
i want to be baptized .
karl childers just in from the state facility . make one of them gruntin ' sounds karl or whatever it is you do . oh well , karl 's a little retarded , he do n't know what the hell i 'm talkin ' about . and to vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients . now that takes balls . our number one tune for the folks , boys . kick it off johnson !

you 're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then . it would n't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ai n't afraid of shit . you think i 'm afraid for you to stay here . you 're just a humped over retard it looks like to me . not really , i 'm just jokin ' with you . welcome to our humble home , buddy . frank needs all the friends he can get . frank 's a real weak little kid . his daddy taught him how to be a pussy .
i ai n't never used no hatchet that i remember .
well , i ca n't understand none of it . this one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another . just how retarded are you ?
a good deal of it , i reckon . ca n't understand all of it .
you believe in the bible ?
different ones . the bible 's one of 'em .
what 's all them books ?
this and that . toothpaste and whatnot .
what 's in your bag ?
i 'm closing the door now . i told you , i 'll see you later .
but maybe just for awhile --
frank , i just like you as a friend . only at the secret place . okay ? i ca n't go there now . i 'll see you later .
can you go there with us now ? me and karl . we could just hang out . karl has some cool books .
here give me the flowers , i 'll do something with them . thank you . now you better go . maybe i 'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something . i have a boyfriend now you know . and we 're pretty serious . he gave me a ring .
he 's gon na be around a lot and i hope you are too , so ...
why ? hi , karl .
i wanted for you to meet karl , too . he 's my new friend . but i feel like i 've always known him . i thought you should meet him .
they 're from the dollar store . i 'm not an idiot . besides we have a garden full of flowers .
i wanted to bring you some flowers . they 're pretty good ones .
hey frank . you should n't be coming over here . my parents really do n't want you to .
okay .
ever'thing 's okay , boy . i kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then i 'm gon na go on and leave here .
okay . i give you my word . is ever'thing gon na be okay ? are you all right ?
do n't go home tonight and stay with that doyle . he 's got it in for ye tonight . i got me a feelin ' , too . feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean . ye mama neither . when you get up from here , i want you to go to that feller 's house . your mama 's friend . i want you to give me your word on it .
you know i would . whatever you want .
will ye do somethin ' for me if i ast you to ?
like something different . i do n't know . you 're leavin ' ai n't you , karl ?
reckon what kind of a feelin ' ?
i 've got a feelin ' today .
yes sir .
man . thanks . you know when you get a feelin ' and you do n't know why ?
i aim fer you to have 'em .
you do n't want to give away all your books .
maybe you can make more sense out of them than i can . i made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on christmas .
hit do n't make no difference where i was to be . we 'll always be friends . there ai n't no way to stop that . i aim for you to have these books .
i care for you , too . but you 'll be around , do n't say that .
i 'm tired , too , frank . if i ai n't around no more , it do n't mean i do n't care fer ye . i care for ye a good deal . i care for you more than anybody they is . we made friends right off the bat .
yeah , i guess so . i 'm real tired , you know that . a kid my age should n't be tired of things .
that feller 's a whole sight meaner than me . he 'd just whup the tar out of me .
karl , i ai n't tryin ' to say nothin ' bad about you , but why do n't you stop doyle when he gets that away ? you 're older than him . you 're strong , too . my daddy would n't let him do that to me and mama .
you 're just a boy . you ort not to use that sort of language .
you have to karl . you have to look out for me . you do n't let that son of a bitch run you off .
i 'm glad of it you was borned . i reckon i ai n't gon na be there in the garage no more .
just diggin ' . i ai n't ever gon na be happy now . not with that son of a bitch movin ' in for good . i wish me and you and mama could just run away . but she said he would find us wherever we went . he 's crazy . sometimes i think it would of been better if i wad n't ever born .
i knowed you 'd be here . what are you a-doin ' digging with that stob ?
hey , karl . how 'd you know to come out here ?
yes ma'am . i like a fried chicken leg .
yeah , i guess .
if i ai n't too stove up . i ai n't like you . i 'm old and give out . i 'm proud of ye .
can we play ever ' saturday ?
i wad n't thinkin ' about nothin ' else just like you told me i 'd do .
it was fun , anyhow .
no sir .
it do n't matter to me about us losin ' does it to you ?
you 're strong though . you let me make them touchdowns so i 'd feel good . my daddy used to do that kind of thing .
them boys was tryin ' to pull me down pretty hard .
i know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me .
we 're liable to win if we keep this up . for somebody like you , you sure run fast .
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you . i seen you over there follerin ' me .
way to go , karl . we got a touchdown . that was a good lateral , man . that was just like the wishbone .
yessir .
we 'll be on teams , me and you ?
yeah .
you will ? for sure ?
i 'll play ball with ye . i reckon if neither one of us is no count it wo n't make no difference .
is that right ?
bill cox is goin ' to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin ' up shop early .
make believin ' always made me feel good too from time to time .
i feel sad about karen cross , too . i just make like to myself she loves me . i know better , though . it just feels good to me when i imagine it .
i do n't reckon i know . i ai n't found no way yet and i 'm three or four times as old as you . might be that 's just the way folks is .
seems like doyle 's wormed his way back in . mama said he 's stayin ' over tonight and he 's talkin ' about movin ' in for good . we ai n't ever gon na be happy . we 'll always be nervous , wo n't we karl ?
readin ' on this book on how to work carpentry . i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times . i 've always been partial to wood buildin 's and cabinets and whatnot . these drawin 's they got here do n't make no sense to me so far . you seem like yore tails a'draggin ' a might . you got somethin ' wrong with ye ?
what you readin ' ?
i reckon .
she said she 'd see me later . that 's kinda good , right ?
yes sir , i reckon it does .
bible says the same thing about killin ' others , too .
i 've studied about it . the bible says not to or you end up goin ' to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades .
i did n't mean to say anything bad about you . i know you 're good . you did n't mean no harm . did you ever think about killin ' yourself on purpose like my daddy did ?
hits been hard thinkin ' about it . they ai n't a day goes by i do n't think about it . i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see . hit makes me sad , too . i have bad thoughts on it . i wished they was somethin ' i could of did , too . should n't no bad things happen to childern . all the ol ' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that 's growed up , the way i see it . i should n't of told you about that . a boy ort not hear about such things . it just kindly come out .
that makes me feel real sad . could n't you have done somethin ' , karl ? i would have . i wish i would of had him . he 'd be here right now . livin ' .
i wad n't but six or eight . i reckon i did n't know what to do . i did n't know how to care for no baby . mama and daddy did n't want him . they learned me to do what they told me to . these days i figure it might of been best to give him right back to the good lord right off the bat anyhow .
that do n't seem right . it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother .
i heared it cryin ' a little through that box .
it was still alive when you buried it ?
i did n't feel right about doin ' that . i takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there . that seemed more proper to me , i reckon .
you threw it in a trash barrel ?
a little ol ' boy .
a boy or girl ?
yes sir . right then it was .
it was alive ?
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin ' in it . i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin ' movin ' in it . hit was bloody-like around that towel . hit was a little ol ' bitty baby , no bigger than a squirrel .
so it died when it come out ?
hit was borned a little too early on . my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other . i reckon they changed their mind about havin ' another'n . i was about six or eight year old then and they did n't care too much for me so i reckon they did n't need somethin ' else to worry 'em with .
why ?
yeah .
why not ? it died ?
i had one there for little bit . hit did n't get old enough to play with .
'cause it 's fun . it do n't matter if you ai n't no good . it takes your mind off of everything else while you 're doin ' it . when you run real fast tryin ' to make a touchdown you do n't think about anything else . i ai n't no good , but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it . did you have any brothers and sisters growin ' up to play with ?
naw .
and then some people you do n't like right off . it 's funny . you know why i want you to play ball with me ?
i do n't reckon i know .
you do n't seem like a daddy . you seem like a brother . wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you do n't even know 'em like what happened with me and you .
he ai n't no count .
i kind of like you tellin ' me what to do and not to do . just like my daddy . i did n't mind him tellin ' me . i hate doyle to tell me what to do . mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us . that we ca n't leave him or he 'll try and hurt her .
you ort not to pull on yourself that away .
i did n't know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time . he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama . i tried it , but i felt funny thinkin ' about my mama . so , i switched over to thinkin ' about his mama and then what he told me would happen , happened . it sure tingles , do n't it ?
yes sir . you ort not know that language .
oh , jackin ' off ?
pull on your works . your privates .
what do you mean ?
that 's real good . you ort not to if ye ai n't married to somebody . bible tells you that much . hit tells some things that do n't seem right too , i reckon . i guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can , though . you do n't touch yourself , do you ?
and i do n't try to touch her . you know , in a bad way . foolin ' around , sex and all .
naw .
just 'cause i 'm not rich do n't mean i do n't love her .
they ort to . you 're a good boy .
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they 're home . reckon why they do n't like me ?
i bet he will . i got a little money if he do n't . i 'll get 'em for ye .
i ai n't got no money to get 'em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store .
if you want me to .
would you go see her with me ? i kind of thought i might take her some flowers like that woman done you .
yeah , i recollect it .
you know that girl i told you about . the one i love .
all right then .
i was wantin ' to ask you somethin ' .
hit was right thoughty of her .
yeah , me too . that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers .
yeah , i reckon they did . hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy .
boy , folks sure had it rough back a long time ago , did n't they ?
all right then .
i 'm gettin ' tired of readin ' for a while .
yeah .
you want to go with me ?
that 's than un on christmas i was tellin ' you about .
it 's name 's a christmas carol .
naw . you can look at all my books you want to .
i was goin ' to the secret place . i borried one of your books to take down there . you ai n't mad , are you ?
that gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin ' with her .
where 'd you get them flowers ?
yeah .
hey karl , you off work ?
i like the way you talk .
i like the way you talk .
i reckon it tastes pretty good to me .
i do n't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it 's made out of .
i reckon if you want me to . i got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some .
will you stay here with us for a long time ?
he ort not to talk that away to you neither . he ai n't no count . he 's mean to you and your mama . yore mama and that feller that 's carryin ' me to get somethin ' d'eat 's gon na be back here directly .
well , i hate him .
you ort not to talk that way . you 're just a boy .
i 'd like to kill that son of a bitch . i hate him .
it 's okay if you 're lookin ' out for yourself . if it 's self-defense . was it self-defense ?
i growed up and got taught it ai n't right to kill nobody .
maybe they needed it .
i thought they was .
were they bad people ?
two people .
who did you kill ?
yeah , i did .
'cause he did n't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to . that 's what the letter said . he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs . i thought he took care of us fine . karl , did you really kill somebody ?
why did he do that , reckon .
it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose .
yeah , i remember you a-tellin ' me that .
karl . you know when i said daddy got hit by a train .
she says it 's for the times when he 's good to her . she 's lonely since daddy died . she said sometimes she do n't know why . he threatened to kill her if she ever left him . my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama . vaughan , he 's real good to mama . vaughan that you met . but he 's not able to do anything to doyle , he 's funny you know . not funny ha , ha , funny queer . he likes to go with men instead of women . that makes him not to be able to fight too good . he sure is nice though . he 's from st. louis . people who are queer can get along better in a big town . he got transferred here to work . but mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him . for bein ' the way he is . i wish he liked to go with women . i 'd rather him be mama 's boyfriend than doyle .
how come her to keep bein ' girlfriends and all with him if he 's mean to her ?
i 've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died . sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here . my mama 's real good , but i wish i had both of 'em . when we went to memphis one time in the car , it was rainin ' so hard we could n't see the road . but i wad n't scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin ' nothin ' could happen to us . i feel that way about mama now . mama has a boyfriend now . his name is doyle hargraves . he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin ' . he still do n't help mama out with any money though . he ai n't no good . he 's mean to her . he do n't like me at all . mama says it 's because he 's jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him . he stays with us all night sometimes , but he 's got his own house . somebody told me it 's so he can still have other girlfriends . i like it on the nights when he ai n't at our house . i 'm not so nervous then .
you do n't need to know all of that . you 're just a boy . you need to think about good thoughts while you 're still a boy . they 'll be plenty of time for the other .
how did your mama die ?
he never did want to . i figure he ai n't changed his mind much .
how do you know ?
my mother 's dead . my daddy 's s'posed to be around still . he do n't want to have nothin ' to do with me though .
they still around , your folks ?
naw . did n't have too much . enough to scrape by on , i reckon .
this is what i call my secret place 'cause i come out here when i feel like bein ' by myself . i used to come here with karen cross . she 's kind of like my girlfriend , or used to be . she says she likes jerry maroney now . but i 'm gon na get her back 'cause i love her . we used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight . she did n't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause i do n't have any money . well , mama and me , i mean . she seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though . she said she loved me , too . out here . settin ' right on that stump you 're on . see , her daddy 's a dentist so they 're rich . so 's jerry maroney 's daddy . he owns the ice plant . was your folks well off ?
they sell some of everything . come on let 's go . i wo n't tell her about you bein ' in the state hospital for killin ' .
i was kindly needin ' to do some tradin ' . reckon they sell toothpaste ?
aw , come on . you 'll like her . she 's real nice . she 'll give us somethin ' if we ask her to . candy or somethin ' .
i do n't want to worry your mama with company .
wait a minute . you want to go with me ? you can meet my mama .
all right then .
well , anyhow , i was just fixin ' to go see my mama down at ben 's dollar store . she 's workin ' two till eight .
i ai n't no good at it . i just come by .
did you want to play ball with us ?
you told me to come by .
yeah . what you doin ' by here ?
yeah it is . your name 's frank .
hey there . i thought i heard somebody on the porch . was n't your name karl ?
me and the burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time . if you ever want to come by and play . we ai n't no good either . well , i 'll see you later .
i never was much count at it . i never did get picked out fer it .
do you like to play football ?
you do n't seem like you 'd kill nobody .
i reckon i feel all right .
are you well ?
they told me i was well . they had to turn me loose .
how come ?
yeah .
they let you out ?
i killed some folks quite awhile back . they said i wad n't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin ' me in jail .
why 'd you live there ?
i did live there in the state hospital .
do n't you live somewhere ?
ai n't got nowhere to set 'em down .
how come you 're carryin ' them around with you .
different ones . one 's the bible . one of 'ems a book on christmas . one of 'ems how to be a carpenter .
what are all them books ?
childers .
what 's you last name ?
we 've had a real hard life , too , mama .
i know honey . just remember what i said , we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think .
he 's lyin ' mama . he ai n't gon na do better .
well , at least he 's tryin ' . but who knows for how long .
i love you , too , mama .
i promise we 're gon na get away from him . the time has to be right , that 's all . i 'd rather him get tired of me and leave me . then he would n't want to hurt me . he would n't care then . we 'll be fine . i promise . you go to bed now . i love you .
doyle would n't really kill you , would he ?
yeah , honey , someday everything 's gon na be all right .
is everything gon na be all right someday ? i just stay nervous all the time just about .
huh ?
mama ?
i know he does .
i bet he do n't . karl likes me .
i guess . he went to the garage . poor thing , he 's probably never seen such a crazy mess . he probably wants to go back and live in mr. cox 's shop .
did karl go to bed ?
yeah , he has to go to work in a little while . i do too .
did vaughan go home ?
what are you doin ' up again , frank ? you need to get a little sleep .
no , honey , we do n't . i 'll make some coffee and start cleanin ' up this mess . karl , you want some coffee , huh ?
we do n't need to think bad thoughts , do we mama ?
i 'm fine , honey . let 's just try and forget about tonight .
you all right , mama ?
he ai n't ever okay to me .
he 's no more an indian than i am though . anyhow , doyle 's gon na try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends . just like he does to frank and me sometimes . you just ignore it . or stay out here away from 'em if he 'll let you . he 's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he 'll get drunk . i guarantee it .
they ai n't even no good . the only one can play is randy horsefeathers . he claims he 's an indian . his real name 's randy collins and he works at the feed mill . he can at least play guitar .
karl , now listen , there 's gon na be a party tonight here at the house . doyle 's invited his music-playin ' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio .
i 'm glad of it , honey .
i sure like the way he talks . it sounds like a race car motor idlin ' . it makes me not be nervous .
i do n't know . he just said he 'd eat out there .
how come karl wo n't eat here with us ?
naw , i do n't want to . me and karl got things we need to do .
maybe you and karl want to go with us ?
frank told me about your situation . and frank loves company . you know , especially after his daddy passed and all . there ai n't no sense in you stayin ' in that old greasy shop . he 's mentally retarded , poor thing .
hey karl , guess what . mama said you can stay with us . out in the garage . our car wo n't fit in there anyway . it 's real neat .
nice to meet you , karl .
oh , that 's karl . i met him at the laundrymat . karl , this is my mama . and vaughan , vaughan 's the manager . he lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they 're best friends .
hey , sweetheart . what you up to ?
hey , mama . hey , vaughan .
me , too .
flowers is pretty . i 've always thought that .
yeah .
a blister shore can hurt .
i ai n't really thought about it too much i do n't reckon .
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin ' . how far did you want to go ?
i reckon .
you walk fast , do n't you ?
i stay on my feet all the time at work . i just ca n't find shoes that 's comfortable .
i like walkin ' quite a bit from time to time .
well , when you like pricing items as much as i do , i guess it 's just bound to happen sooner or later .
yes ma'am , i reckon .
i told you , i ai n't got no boy , now get on out from here and let me be .
that grass out in the yard 's all growed up . i figured i might cut it fer ye .
they turned me aloose from the nervous hospital . said i was well .
i ai n't got no boy .
i 'm ye oldest boy name karl .
i ai n't got no boy .

well , i guess we better hit the road .
yes sir .
did n't you go to sleep at all , karl ? you been sittin ' there like that all night ?
yes sir .
karl , you up ?
he 's a-carryin ' me to look fer work in millsburg where i was borned .
she 's talkin ' about me , karl . that 's my first name .
i reckon i can just walk around till the mornin ' . or set and read me a book somewhere .
no , i mean your past . about why you were in here . i 'll take you first thing in the mornin ' . you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all ? i just ca n't let you stay here . it 's the rules . if something happened well , i 'd be liable .
i never was no good with history .
i ca n't promise he 'll hire you . i 'll have to tell him about your history .
i reckon .
i know , i 've seen it myself . would you give that a try ?
i 'm pretty handy i reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot .
listen , karl , the truth is i do n't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do . if it was up to me , i 'd let you stay here if that 's what you wanted . i 'm just doin ' my job . you follow me ? listen , i know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in millsburg . he used to go to church with me . you 're good workin ' on small engines and things . if i put my neck out for you with him , will you work at it if he 'll hire you ?
naw . never did know too much of nobody . not to he'p me out anyway .
your daddy 's still livin ' down there from what you told me . i guess he would n't help you any , would he ? i was n't thinking . you do n't know anybody ?
naw .
well , you have to learn . it 'll take some time . do n't you know anybody down there to help you out ?
i reckon i do n't care nothin ' about bein ' a free man . i do n't know how to go about it .
well , you ca n't do that . you 're a free man . you 've been let out to do as you please .
i want to come back and stay here .
karl , what in the world are you doing here ?
all right then .
you better go get 'em .
i ai n't got nothing but them books .
you better go get your things .
i reckon i 'm gon na have to get used to them lookin ' at me , too .
yes , i guess you are .
i reckon i 'm gon na have to get used to looking at pretty people .
thank ye . i 'm just getting around to tellin ' you , but i fixed your warshin ' machine .
we sure like havin ' you .
you 've been real good to me , too . it ai n't ever'body that 'd make biscuits in the middle of the night . you and that boy has give me a good feelin ' .
well thank you , hun . that 's real good of you to say . i would n't know what to do without him either .
you 're a good mama to that boy . you care for him . you work hard fer him to take care of him . you light him up in his eyes , i 've seen it . he would n't know what to do without ye .
yeah .
ma'am ?
all right then . well , i 'll see you later . if you see frank , tell him to come on back home . i do n't get to see him all day except sundays . he can play tomorrow .
he wanted to go off and play , i reckon . you go in there and you and that doyle eat ye dinner . you do n't have to worry yourself none .
where 'd he go ? what 's goin ' on ?
frank , he went off , too . he ai n't gon na be in there when you get indoors .
well , okay . i got you some .
no ma'am . i 'm a'goin ' off sommers .
where are you goin ' , karl ? did n't you want some chicken and things ?
i could shore use some . thank ye .
you 're a hell of a boy , frank . someday you 're gon na get all the good things you deserve . and karl here 's gon na get some more biscuits tonight . what do you think about that ?
all right then .
karl , why do n't you and melinda go take a walk . it 's nice out .
i believe you . i really do .
yes ma'am . i like your garage . i would n't never hurt you or your boy . i 'd lay my hand on the bible and say the same thing .
was that you ? i remember that . i was only three or four , but i always heard about it growin ' up . they say you 're well ?
i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon . i thought they was a-doin ' wrong . i was about your boy 's age . they say i 'm well now from it .
that 's okay . it 's not really my business . i have wondered though . why was it ? was it like a nervous breakdown ?
hit ai n't right for me to keep from tellin ' you how come me to be put in the state hospital .
i like frank . he 's a good boy . me and him 's made friends .
vaughan 's `` friend '' will be there , too . he works at the funeral home . and frank . you know frank likes you a lot . he says you make him feel calm .
i would n't mind a havin ' supper .
it 's all right . you know i was thinkin ' there 's this girl that works with me . she 's real heavy , but she 's cute in the face . well , you know , she 's slow . she 's a little bit , i think . she 's not retarded , just -- it do n't matter , listen to me . i thought you might like to meet her . vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her . would you like that ?
thank ye .
okay .
mustard 's good on 'em to me .
well , set down and i 'll make some biscuits and gravy .
yes ma'am .
well , it is nearly breakfast time anyway . i ca n't go to sleep . i have to be at work in three hours . you know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two , you feel worse than if you had n't slept at all ?
just whenever you take a notion to . i do n't aim to put you out .
right now ?
do you reckon you can make me some biscuits ?
i 'll be dog .
two fellers was on a bridge a takin ' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water . one of 'em came from arkansas , i believe .
no ma'am .
want to sit down ? did you need somethin ' ?
i did n't aim to .
you scared me .
karl , this is my boyfriend , doyle . frank , why do n't you and karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin ' . vaughan , you ready to go ?
tolerable , i reckon .
hey , vaughan . how are you , karl ?
i do n't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy . you 've been real square dealin ' with me . the bible says two men ort not lay together . but i 'll bet you the good lord would n't send nobody like you to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades . that boy lives inside of his own heart . hits an awful big place . you take care of that boy .
what about you , karl ? do you want to stay here ?
naw , not yet . i want ye to give this to mizz wheatley . hit ai n't much , but maybe there 's a little somethin ' to hep out . hits what i 've earned fixin ' lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill cox .
well , sure , okay . he has n't hurt them , has he ?
that dern doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin ' and bein ' mean to folks . will you give me your word you 'll do it ?
what 's wrong ? is everything okay ?
this evenin ' i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight .
okay .
i ai n't a-stayin ' . i need to ast you fer a favor .
karl , what are you doing here ? come in .
i ai n't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em . i ca n't understand a lot of what i try to read . my mind , hit wonders off to somethin ' else when i try to read .
i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually . you should see all the books he has . he must read constantly .
before that i was thinkin ' it 'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry .
oh . how about before that ?
i was thinkin ' i could use me another helpin ' of these potaters .
that 's what i thought . i hope i have n't offended you in any way . you seem like a thinker . you seem to always be in deep thought . tell me something . what are you thinking right now ?
i would n't never hurt them .
anyway , it 's hard to live gay , that 's the right way to say it , in a small town like this . i 've wanted to leave many times , but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we wo n't go into have kept me from it . anyway , i 'm rambling . if you 're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it wo n't be easy . doyle is a monster . not just a closed minded redneck , but a monster . a dangerous person . i 've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy . maybe even kill one of them . i see it in his eyes . i 'm very in tune , maybe even psychic . doyle will make your life hell . you 're a perfect target . when i first saw you i was afraid of you . not really afraid , i guess , just taken aback . but also , i felt a real sensitive feeling from you . and for some reason , frank has adopted you . much like a stray animal . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it like that . in a good way . anyway , i just want you to know what you 're in for . i have a good feeling about you . you 're good for frank . maybe it 's that he can have an adult friend on a child 's level . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it in a bad way . there 's one more thing . it 's none of my business why you were in the state hospital . everyone has something in their past , maybe you tried suicide , maybe you did something -- terrible . but what i see before me is a gentle , simple man . all i want you to promise me is that you 're capable of being around linda and frank . you know . you would never hurt them under any circumstances , would you ?
i 've heard it said that way .
well that 's a very offensive way to put it . you should n't say that . you were taught that , were n't you ?
not funny , ha , ha , funny queer .
homosexual . i like men . sexually .
i reckon not .
okay , karl , the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind . i guess i 'll put it right out on the table . where do i start . linda and frank are very important to me . they 're like family . my own family was never like family . they 're horrible people . as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die . i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him . now i just do n't care . you see , you and i are a lot alike , strange as that may seem . i mean not physically or even mentally really , just well , maybe emotionally or actually the hand we 've been dealt in life . we 're different . people see us as being different anyway . you 're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and i , well mine 's not as easy to see . i 'm just going to say it . i 'm gay . does that surprise you ? that i 'm gay . you know what being gay is , do n't you ?
okay , i 'll come by mr. cox 's and get you at noon .
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin ' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow . bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters . but i reckon he can lay off doin ' it tomorrow .
i mean tomorrow or the next day .
i done et just a little bit ago .
listen , before you get very used to staying here , i think you and i need to talk about a few things . can i take you to lunch ?
quite a spell , i reckon .
how long have you been standing here ?
naw , i ai n't .
did you knock on the door yet ?
that boy wants me to .
so , you 're really going to stay here ?
yes sir .
not really to speak of .
do you have family here ?
i reckon mr. woolridge got me hired on to work for bill cox 's outfit .
is that right ? are you going to be staying here long ?
they turned me loose from the state hospital .
why are you here now ?
what 's that you say ?
what brings you back ?
i 's horned and raised here up till i 's twelve year old .
it 's been here seventeen years . did you live here before or something ?
naw , i do n't believe you have . i do n't reckon i never been in here . this store did n't used to be here .
i do n't think i 've ever seen you before .
that 's very sweet of you vaughan . we care about you , too . do n't we y'all ?
listen everybody , i know this may sound corny , i 've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional , but i 'm going to say it anyway . it just came over me in a rush . i want you all to know that i care about each and every one of you at this table .
i 'm sorry .
vaughan , do n't get pushy .
karl , maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner . it 's a nice night .
hey karl , you know what ? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february . is n't that somethin ' ?
good . i have n't decided yet if i 'm a good cook .
karl is a guy guy ?
i do n't think he sees you as a guy guy .
what about me ?
he 's retarded 's all . you know he 's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ai n't a good one with his mean ass .
he 's been in the state hospital a long time , something must be wrong with him .
frank 's just crazy about him . he likes the way he talks . he helped him carry home the clean laundry .
are you sure it 's safe to let him around that guy ?
i know .
he just got out of the state hospital .
can i help you , sir ?
frank , do n't talk that way . who 's that strange lookin ' man behind you ? did he follow you in here ?
why wo n't he talk to women ?
i thought you 'd be happy to leave .
no , we have to get this story .
let 's just go , marsha .
yeah .
do you smell shit ?
hey , you 're the one that wanted to major in journalism . anyhow , was n't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it , it was twenty-five years ago , he probably does n't even remember it .
in a few minutes we 're gon na be in a room with a killer . that does n't bother you ?
i do n't know why you 're so weirded out , this is not san quentin , it 's just a nuthouse . most of these people do n't even know where they are , they 're not gon na hurt you .
as much as anybody else is , i guess . y'all have a good rest of the day now .
will he be supervised ?
wherever he wants to . i think he 's going back to millsburg where he 's from . it 's just about twenty miles from here .
where will he go ?
i hope the best for you , miss dwiggins , with your school and your paper and all .
i did n't mean that .
we 've got some paperwork to take care of . pretty soon . do n't worry , you wo n't run into him in the parking lot .
is he leaving right this minute ?
homicidal signs . oh , we 're gon na change the light in here for karl . i hope you can see to write .
signs ?
he 's free . his time 's up . that 's the rules . he 's been treated and reevaluated . he does n't show any signs any more .
can i ask you a question ? if he 's so troubled , why are you letting him out ? what if he does it again ? it happens all the time .
it 's the best you 're gon na get . i 'm sorry .
how am i going to conduct an interview if i ca n't ask him any questions ?
but , here 's the thing . he 'll only talk to you . he does n't want you to ask him anything . and you should n't stare at him .
one of his daddy 's bible lessons i imagine . y'all pull up a chair . i 'll go out and talk to him .
that 's really strange . what does it mean ?
i do n't think so . just period , i think . she told him ... god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of . karl has an entire book -- a notebook . on every page it says `` franklin chapter 1 verse number 1 . '' he wrote that a few years ago after he 'd learned to write . his father 's name was franklin .
before they were married ?
his mother told him that he was their punishment . hers and his father 's ; from god , for having sex --
i knew he slept in a toolshed .
you see , karl , growing up , only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it . he could n't really read but , well , neither could his mother . but , his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said . and she made sure karl knew . you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed , right ?
melvin , go get karl and take him down to the old classroom .
ca n't you talk to him ? maybe talk him into it . i 'm a real good interviewer . just get me in the room with him .
well , what do we do ? we drove all the way out here .
i do n't know what to tell you . i 'm sorry . i made myself pretty clear i thought . he probably got busy and was n't thinking . i know how that is . i used to teach shop and eighth grade science .
the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man . karl wo n't talk to women .
no thank you .
karl 's real sensitive about having his picture made . he would n't even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage . melvin , would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes ? you girls want some coffee ?
well , yeah , it 's for the school newspaper . but it has pictures . i mean it 's a regular paper , you know .
i think there must have been a little mix up . i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is , there could n't be any pictures . it 's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something , is n't that right ?
yes sir .
y'all have a seat . is this all of you ?
nice to meet you . i 'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans . she 's here to take the pictures .
my name 's jerry woolridge .
i think everybody at the store knows that already . they always talk about it . maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you ai n't allowed over at the first baptist church no more .
yes .
you mean about y'all bein ' together in `` that '' way ?
well , a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors . unfortunately , i have to keep certain parts of my life private .
why ?
also , melinda , please do n't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight , okay .
no wonder it 's such a screwed-up place .
i once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the united states have at least one relative who has lived in brooklyn at one time or another .
like me , too .
actually , i 'm his father .
and what are you , his chaperone ?
three 's a crowd . yes , i 'm aware of that . but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes . to make sure he does n't get himself into trouble .
ah-hah , i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go --
i would n't actually call it a party . it 's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday . the guest list is quite restricted . so far , there 's mr. benjamin and myself . if you accept , that would make three of us .
and how many people will be attending this birthday party ?
it 's my birthday .
and what 's the occasion of this celebration ?
an invitation ?
good . then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you ?
no ! at least i do n't think i am !
perhaps i should rephrase the question . what i mean to say is , are you married or seriously involved with a significant other ?
what !
wonderful . when your next book is published , maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i 'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up .
it 's coming along . at the rate he 's going , he 'll have a story finished by the end of the summer .
forty-one pages .
okay . i 'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow . it does n't seem to be too long .
uh ... actually , it might be better if you read the story first . call me when you 're finished , okay ?
i get off for lunch in ten minutes . can i treat you to a hamburger ?
good . i hope you like it . it was a long time in coming .
i 'd love to .
i finished my story . i thought you might want to take a look at it .
almost done . a week or ten days , and i 'll be there .
yeah , well , i 've sort of been out of commission . how 's melville ?
it 's been a while . i thought maybe you 'd be in touch .
i 'll tell you all about it ... ... but not here .
what happened ?
it looks worse than it is . i 'm okay .
jesus , what happened to you ?
which explains why this has n't been the easiest summer of my life .
not an easy book .
that 's the subject of my last chapter .
melville , huh ? it 's been a while .
of course i fool around . but not so much when it comes to my work , it 's true . have you ever read pierre , or the ambiguities ?
wow . you do n't fool around , do you ?
visions of utopia in nineteenth-century american fiction .
what else . of course , what else ? and what are you writing about for your thesis ?
american literature . what else ?
your dissertation ? what subject do you study ?
it 's just a summer job . something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation .
and the bookstore ? have you been working there long ?
just like me .
muncie , indiana . he and my mother met as students . but i 'm from brooklyn . my sisters and i were all born and bred right here .
and your father ? is he from new york ?
until she was twelve . she moved here in 'forty-nine .
so your mother grew up in shanghai ?
i keep waiting for the next novel to come out . anything in the works ?
i confess .
i thought i recognized you . you 're paul benjamin the writer , are n't you ?
better make it charge .
will that be cash or charge ?
thanks . i knew you 'd understand .
uh , sure , sol . anything you say . instead of saying , `` one corned beef sandwich , '' and then , `` another corned beef sandwich , '' i 'll say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . ''
it 's simpler , that 's what . it makes things go faster .
what 's the difference ?
next time , when you want two corned beef sandwiches , say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . '' when you want two ginger ales , say , `` two ginger ales . ''
what 's that , sol ?
do me a favor , will you ?
for me ? i 'll have the same thing .
what about for you ?
huh ?
and what about for you ?
uh ... my friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale .
what 'll it be , auggie ?
exactly . life just would n't be worth living , would it ?
shit . if you ca n't share your secrets with your friends , what kind of friend are you ?
i mean , it 's a good story .
what do you mean ?
yes , i suppose i do .
and now you 've got your christmas story , do n't you ?
i would n't say that . but at least you 've put the camera to good use .
anything for art , eh , paul ?
you made her happy . and the camera was stolen anyway . it 's not as if the person you took it from really owned it .
i lied to her , and then i stole from her . i do n't see how you can call that a good deed .
it was a good deed , auggie . it was a nice thing you did for her .
i guess so . i never thought of it that way .
which means that she spent her last christmas with you .
yeah , probably .
she probably died .
once , about three or four months later . i felt so bad about stealing the camera , i had n't even used it yet . i finally made up my mind to return it , but granny ethel was n't there anymore . someone else had moved into the apartment , and he could n't tell me where she was .
did you ever go back to see her ?
okay . so this is the story of how it happened . okay . it was the summer of 'seventy-six , back when i first started working for vinnie . the summer of the bicentennial . a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store . he 's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt . it was crowded around the counter just then , so i did n't see him at first ... .
every word .
okay . you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures ? well , this is the story of how i got my first camera . as a matter of fact , it 's the only camera i 've ever had . are you following me so far ?
i 'm all ears .
ready . any time you are .
so . are we ready ?
you got it .
i have to pee . if the waiter comes , order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale , okay ?
take over the register while i 'm gone , okay , jimmy ?
it does n't have to be true . it just has to be good .
good ? of course . are you kidding ? i 'll tell you what . buy me lunch , my friend , and i 'll tell you the best christmas story you ever heard . how 's that ? and i guarantee every word of it is true .
anything good ?
christmas stories ? sure , i know a ton of 'em .
yeah , great . the problem is , i have four days to come up with something , and i do n't have a single idea . you know anything about christmas stories ?
that 's a feather in your cap , man . the paper of record .
fine . or it was until a couple of days ago . a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story . they want to publish it on christmas day .
ah-hah .
yeah , i know , but i 'm trying to cut down . somebody 's worried about my health .
you usually get two .
uh , better make it one .
two , right ?
hi , auggie .
hey , man , how 's it going ?
we 'd better be . i have n't spent a night out of brooklyn in fourteen years , and i 'm not about to break my record now . besides , i 've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning .
it 's not a long drive . an hour , an hour and a half . we 'll be back in time for dinner .
it 's tommy 's . the sucker owed me a favor .
nice machine , auggie . where 'd you find it ?
nothing much . he said his socks and underpants were dirty , and would we mind driving up with his things . fucking kids , huh ? they take you for granted every time .
so what did he say when he called ?
or did n't . there 's no way of knowing , is there ?
that could be a good sign , though . it could mean that he got away .
i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago , but she has n't heard from him either . it 's beginning to get a little scary .
not a peep .
you have n't heard from rashid , have you ?
for once in my life i managed to keep my mouth shut . there 's something to be said for that , i suppose .
fuckus my assus . they did some number on you .
no . the ... uh ... the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens . but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull . assaultus interruptus .
cops ? you mean they nabbed those cruds ?
it could have been worse . if the cops had n't come , i might not be standing here now .
fuck you , kid .
it 's written all over you like a neon sign . now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better .
you 're right . i just was n't sure you knew .
no , he 's not . you are .
he 's crazy .
do n't be an ass , auggie . he 's trying to make it up to you , ca n't you see that ?
if he 's got something to tell me , why do n't he tell it to me himself ?
he 's got something to tell you , auggie .
yeah , well , i 'm sorry too . it took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks , and now i 'm broke . i ca n't hardly pay for this beer . not to speak of having my credibility destroyed . do you understand what i 'm saying ? my credibility . so yeah , i 'm sorry , too . about as sorry as i 've ever been in my whole fucking life .
the kid 's sorry , auggie .
hey , kid . you interested in a job ? i just got word from your employment agency that you 're looking for a position in retail sales .
i 'm thinking about the kid . i 'm sure he 'd do a good job for you .
help ? hmm . it 's possible . what did you have in mind ?
hey , auggie , i 've just been thinking . you would n't need some help around the store , would you ? some summer help while vinnie 's gone ?
how old , kid ?
it 's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little .
so , what brings you to a dive like this ?
this is april lee , auggie . april , say hello to auggie wren .
hey , man , good to see you .
it 's ellen . look at her . look at my sweet darling .
yeah . there she is . she 's in quite a few from that year . she must have been on her way to work .
yeah , that 's what i 'd recommend . you know how it is . tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , time creeps on its petty pace .
slow down , huh ?
they 're all the same , but each one is different from every other one . you 've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings . you 've got your summer light and your autumn light . you 've got your weekdays and your weekends . you 've got your people in overcoats and galoshes , and you 've got your people in shorts and t-shirts . sometimes the same people , sometimes different ones . and sometimes the different ones become the same , and the same ones disappear . the earth revolves around the sun , and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle .
but they 're all the same .
i mean , you 're going too fast . you 're hardly even looking at the pictures .
what do you mean ?
you 'll never get it if you do n't slow down , my friend .
it 's kind of overwhelming .
i do n't know , it just came to me . it 's my corner , after all . it 's just one little part of the world , but things happen there , too , just like everywhere else . it 's a record of my little spot .
amazing . i 'm not sure i get it , though . i mean , how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project ?
it 's my project . what you 'd call my life 's work .
i 've never seen anything like it .
that 's right . more than four thousand pictures of the same place . the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning . four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather . that 's why i can never take a vacation . i 've got to be in my spot every morning . every morning in the same spot at the same time .
they 're all the same .
it can be arranged . seeing as how i 've read your books . i do n't see why i should n't share my pictures with you . it would be an honor .
i 'd like to see your pictures some day .
well , let 's not exaggerate . i take pictures . you line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter . no need to mess around with all that artisto crap .
a photographer ...
taking pictures ? it 's a long story . i 'd need two or three drinks to get through that one .
how 'd you get started ?
that 's what people see , but that ai n't necessarily what i am .
so you 're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter .
i guess you could call it a hobby . it does n't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it , but i do it every day . rain or shine , sleet or snow . sort of like the postman . sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job , and my job is just a way to support my hobby .
i did n't know you took pictures .
it 's mine all right . i 've owned that little sucker for a long time .
it 's yours ?
yeah , i did .
looks like someone forgot a camera .
no problem . it 's not as though i 'm rushing off to the opera or anything .
do you think i could buy some before you leave ?
you run out of schimmelpennincks ?
are you closed ?
i would n't think of it . see you around , fellas .
seven eighty-five out of twenty . take care of yourself now , and do n't do anything i would n't do .
not elizabeth the second , elizabeth the first . did you ever hear of sir walter raleigh ?
the queen of england ?
definitely . i suppose it all goes back to queen elizabeth .
the boys and i were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars . some interesting connections there , do n't you think ?
two tins of schimmelpennincks . and throw in a lighter while you 're at it .
hey , man . good to see you . what 'll it be today ?
hey , auggie . how 's it going ?
anything , auggie . just name it .
there 's just one thing i want to know .
i 'm sorry , baby . i ca n't help it .
fuck this angel shit . just take the dough , ruby . but no bawling , okay ? i ca n't stand people who blubber .
i ca n't believe it . oh god , i ca n't believe it . you 're an angel , auggie . an angel from heaven .
for keeps .
for keeps ?
it 's all yours , baby .
and you 're giving it to me ?
five thousand bucks .
jesus god , auggie . there 's money in here .
why do n't you open it and find out ?
what 's this ?
no , bully for you .
bully for you .
remember that business venture i was telling you about ? well , my tugboat came in . i 'm flush .
are you calling me a liar ? i 'm telling you i 'm broke . i do n't even have insurance on my goddamned car .
no you 're not .
i 'd never be able to talk her into it . and even if i could , those things cost money . and that 's just what i do n't have . i 'm flat out dead broke .
not if you got her into one of those rehab programs .
dream on , auggie . she 'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday .
she 's just a kid . there 's time for more babies later . after she grows up .
yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that 's her business .
still , you ca n't just write her off .
i do n't have much choice , do i ? it 's pretty clear she does n't want me around .
so you 're just going to give up and go home ?
you told me you wanted to meet him . well , here he is .
jesus christ . this is all i need .
when i told her i was going to bring her father , she kind of melted . it 's the first time felicity 's talked nice to me since she left home . she 's dying to meet you , auggie .
cut it out . just cut it out , okay ? it 's starting to get on my nerves .
she looks just like you .
and what 's that supposed to mean ?
wait till you see her , auggie .
look , i 'm not saying you do n't have a daughter . it 's just that she 's not my daughter .
that i was n't bullshitting you , sweetheart . at least you 'll know i 've been telling the truth .
yeah , like what ?
relax , okay ? you do n't have to do anything . just go in there and pretend . it wo n't kill you to do a little favor like that . besides , you might even learn something .
i think you 'd better stop the car and let me out .
it was the only way , auggie . otherwise , she was n't going to let me see her .
you what ?
i told her she was going to meet her father .
dammit , auggie , do n't ask so many questions . just get in the car .
where to ?
just get in and shut up . i 'm not asking you to do anything . i just need you to come with me .
you do n't give up , do you ?
get in , auggie . i 've got something to show you .
i know you think i 'm lying to you , but i 'm not . every word i told you is the god 's honest truth .
you 're a cold-hearted bastard , are n't you ? how 'd you ever get so mean , auggie ?
nice try , old girl . i 'd like to help you out . you know , for old time 's sake . but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture , and i have n't collected my profits yet . too bad . you caught me at the wrong time .
i thought i could handle it . i did n't want to bug you . i thought i could handle it on my own , but i could n't . she 's in real bad , auggie .
fifteen years ago ? it wo n't wash , pumpkin . no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he 's a father . i was n't born yesterday , you know .
who the hell knows ? he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago .
good old frank . and how is fat mr. grease monkey these days ?
then why do you think i married frank ? i was already pregnant , and i did n't have much time . say what you like , but at least he gave my kid a name .
you 're conning me , sweetheart . i ai n't responsible for no baby .
and that 's how felicity came into the picture . during one of those two seconds .
a couple of moments , i 'll grant you that . a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity .
it fizzled , baby . that 's the way it goes . but we had our times , did n't we ? it was n't all bad .
you were n't so lukewarm yourself . at least at first .
it was over with bill before you ever came home . maybe you do n't remember it now , but you were pretty hot to see me back then .
yeah , well , i lost my pen . by the time i got a new one , i was clean out of paper .
you did n't write to me for more than a year . what was i supposed to think ?
that 's what you told me when i shoplifted that necklace for you . you remember , baby , do n't you ? the judge gave me a choice : either go to the can or enlist . so , instead of going to college , i wind up in the navy for four years , i watch men lose their arms and legs , i nearly get my head blown off , and you , sweet ruby mcnutt , you run off and marry that asshole , bill .
why would i lie to you , auggie ? you think it was easy to come here and walk into this place ? why would i do it if i did n't have to ?
you 've suckered me before , darling , remember ? why should i believe you now ?
i do n't know who else to turn to , auggie .
i know what it means . that still do n't make it a good name .
it means `` happiness . ''
stop it , already . just stop all this crap right now . was that your idea to call her felicity ?
her name is felicity , and she just turned eighteen . she ran away from pittsburgh last year , and now she 's living in some shit-hole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico . strung out on crack , four months pregnant . i ca n't bear to think about that baby . our grandchild , auggie . just think of it . our grandchild .
our daughter ? is that what you said ? our daughter ? i mean , you might have a daughter , but i sure as hell do n't . and even if i did -- which i do n't -- she would n't be our daughter .
do n't rush me , okay ? you 're jumping to conclusions before i 've even said anything . and besides , it 's not for me . it 's for our daughter .
help , huh ? and i do n't suppose this help has anything to do with money , does it ?
like what you 're doing . i 'm not going to eat you up . i need your help , and if you keep staring at me like that . i might start screaming .
like what ?
do n't look at me like that . auggie . it gives me the creeps .
all right , sugar , what 's on your mind ?
you heard her , pipsqueak . the lady and i have private business to discuss . go outside and stand in front of the door . if anyone tries to come in , tell 'em we 're closed . you got that ?
this is private , auggie . just between you and i .
talk away , lady of my dreams . i 'm all ears .
i 've got something to talk to you about , and the least you can do is listen . you owe me that much . i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you , and i 'm not going until you 've heard me out .
at least i 've stayed true to myself . which is more than i can say about some people .
you always were a son-of-a-bitch , were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook ?
i do n't want to talk about it . if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed , auggie , and it never gave me nothing but grief .
no i 'm not . i look like shit . and so do you , ruby . you look just awful . what 's with the patch , anyway ? what 'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin ?
you 're looking good , auggie .
is that all ? i thought it was about three hundred .
eighteen and a half years .
christ , ruby , it 's been so long . i figured you were dead .
okay , my man . love to the wife and kids , et cetera , et cetera . drop me a postcard if you can remember the address .
i 've got to get moving . terry will bust my chops if i 'm late . see you in september , auggie .
they come in , they go out . i 've got it planned to the last detail .
suit yourself . but do n't keep the boxes around here long .
it 's the law that 's buying . that 's what 's so beautiful about it . i mean , when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail ?
no thanks . i do n't care what you do , but just make sure you do n't get caught , okay ? the last i heard , it was still illegal to sell cuban cigars in this country .
it 's all set . my guy in miami said he 'd have them within the next few weeks . are you sure you do n't want to go in with me ? five thousand dollars outlay , a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return . a consortium of court street lawyers and judges . they 're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine cuban cigars .
speaking of which , are you still going ahead with that deal on the montecristos ?
tobacco today , sex tomorrow . in three or four years , it 'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers .
they catch you smoking tobacco , they 'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you .
enjoy it while you can , vin . pretty soon , they 're going to legislate us out of business anyway .
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do . the fuckers are going to kill me one day .
i try not to , anyway . it 's better for your health . i mean , look at you , vincent . you 're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on long island . you 're the guy with the white shoes and the white caddy and the white shag carpet . but you 've had two heart attacks , and i 'm still waiting for my first .
you do n't take anything seriously , do you ?
she made a play for me after i got back , but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration . every time we got into a clinch , i 'd start thinking about that hole in her head , that empty socket with the glass eye in it . an eye that could n't see , an eye that could n't shed any tears . the minute i started thinking about it , mr. johnson would get all soft and small . and i ca n't see getting married if mr. johnson is n't going to be in tiptop shape .
lovely .
she upped and married some other cat after i joined the navy . by the time i got my discharge , though , she was divorced . her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel .
sounds like another one of your stories to me .
ruby mcnutt . my one true love .
yeah , i know . to that girl who moved to pittsburgh .
i almost got married once .
shit . you should have been married to someone by now . you know , settled down somewhere with a kid or two , a nice steady job .
i do n't know . maybe because i love you so much , boss .
it 's pretty crazy , do n't you think ? i mean , a smart guy like you . what do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for ?
i do n't know . thirteen , fourteen years . something like that .
how long you been working for me , auggie ?
no problem , vinnie . everything 's under control . i could run this store in my sleep .
okay . i think everything 's set . you 've got the number for cape cod , right ? just in case something goes wrong .
what difference does it make ?
come on , come on , you yellow belly . the whole thing . first name and last name .
you 're a dumb , whacked-out little fuck , do you know that ?
to look at the dirty magazines . i can see all the naked women i want , and it does n't cost me a cent .
your job ? you 've got five thousand bucks . what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for ?
so i can get my job back .
and why the hell would you give me money ?
what do you care where it comes from ? it 's yours .
shit . i do n't want your money , you little twerp . it 's probably stolen anyway .
no , it 's five thousand dollars .
what is this , some kind of joke ?
open it .
for me ? and what am i supposed to do with a paper bag ?
it 's for you .
this way , gentlemen . let 's retire to my office , shall we ?
a little . not much .
sure thing . see you later .
i 'll be back in about an hour . watch the register while i 'm gone , okay ?
ten o'clock tomorrow morning . i 'll be there .
come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we 'll talk about it , okay ? we 'll see what we can work out .
a job ? i definitely would n't turn down a job .
good . keep it up , and maybe one day you 'll grow up and become a great man like me .
definitely . i 'd say you 've hit the nail on the head .
seventeen ? i remember when i was seventeen . christ , i was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when i was seventeen . is that what you are , son ? one little whacked-out crazy fella ?
seventeen .
i thought maybe he was pretending .
of course it hurts . what does it look like ?
does it hurt ?
jesus , man , you 're one fucking mess .
sure , auggie . i follow . when you do n't know nothing , it 's like paradise . i know what that is . it 's after you 're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels .
... if it happens , it happens . if it does n't , it does n't . do you understand what i 'm saying ? you never know what 's going to happen next , and the moment you think you know , that 's the moment you do n't know a goddamn thing . that 's what we call a paradox . are you following me ?
okay , auggie , i got it . you do n't have to yell .
when i tell you it 's open . it 's open when i tell you it 's open !
sure , auggie , i got it . the store 's closed . and when do i tell them it 's open ?
i just do what you tell me , auggie . you tell me to sweep , so i sweep .
that 's how it is with sidewalks . people come , people go , and they all drop shit on the ground . as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next , the first spot is dirty again .
huh ?
it 'll never be finished .
good , auggie . real good . all finished .
how 'd you do out there , jimmy ?
damned if i know . but it has a nice ring to it , do n't it ?
what does that mean ?
any time . and congratulations to you and your wife . just remember , though , in the immortal words of rudyard kipling : `` a woman is just a woman , but a cigar is a smoke .
thanks for the tip .
it 'll keep them fresh . if they get too dry , they 'll break . and you do n't want that to happen , do you ? tobacco is a plant , and it needs the same loving care you 'd give an orchid .
the refrigerator ?
a good choice . you would n't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers , would you ? remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out .
i think i 'll take them .
forty-four . they 're on special this week from the canary islands . a real bargain .
and these ?
fifty-six . that girl had on a corset .
and these ?
seventy-eight dollars . the girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties .
and how much are these ?
they do n't come cheap , son . these little honeys are works of art . rolled by hand in a tropical climate , most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on . little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage . the smooth , delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another ...
henry told cyrus he 'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again . when henry makes a threat like that , people tend to take him seriously .
and he 's never tried to get in touch with his son ?
no , i do n't suppose it has . he was broken up like nobody 's business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead .
it ca n't have been easy on him . walking around with that on his conscience all these years .
jesus had nothing to do with it . if he 'd been involved . he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did .
jesus .
do n't put words in my mouth . what i 'm saying is she drove off in cyrus 's car and went to the five-spot lounge with him for a drink . what i 'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car , he was in no shape to drive . but he drove the car anyway , and before he could get her back to where she lived , the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck . louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed . cyrus lived , but he came out of it a cripple . his left arm was so mangled , the doctors had to cut it off . small punishment for what he did , if you ask me .
you mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind ?
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born . louisa was henry 's younger sister , and she and the baby moved in with us . four or five years go by , and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue , tail between his legs , wanting to patch things up with louisa . i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door . they 're both big men , those two , and if they ever started to tangle , you 'd see some teeth jumping on the floor . i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet . and the poor girl never came back .
those are pretty hostile words .
and nothing . thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said , `` i do n't have a father . as far as i 'm concerned , that son-of-a-bitch is dead . ''
and ?
i figured he had a right to know .
and you told your nephew about it ?
well , one thing i suppose , but i do n't think it has anything to do with this . a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill .
has anything happened lately ? anything unusual or unexpected ?
no thank you .
do you want something to drink ? a beer ? a glass of water ?
he 's in trouble , all right . but i do n't have any idea what it is .
i was about to get run over by a car , and your nephew pulled me back . he saved my life . i sensed he was in trouble , so i offered to put him up for a few days . maybe i should have pressed him a little more , i do n't know . i feel pretty stupid about it now .
which brings me back to my original question . what was he doing here in the first place ?
i should n't have let him go .
his mother 's dead , and he has n't seen his father in twelve years .
and his parents ?
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn .
he does n't go to the trinity school ?
i always knew that boy had an imagination , but now he 's gone and made up a whole new life for himself . do you mind if i sit down ? he 's been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby . and we do n't live in manhattan . we live in boerum hill . in the projects .
that 's what he said . he told me he lived with his mother and father on east seventy-fourth street .
his parents ? is that what he told you ? his parents ?
as far as i know , he went back to his parents .
i just want to know where he is .
look , lady , that 's enough . if you do n't calm down . i 'm going to throw you out . do you hear me ? right now !
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?
well , whatever his name is , he 's not here anymore . he left two days ago , and i have n't heard from him since .
rashid ? rashid ! is that what he told you his name was ?
you mean rashid ?
thomas cole . thomas jefferson cole . my nephew .
i 'm telling you . i do n't know anyone named thomas .
do n't give me any of that . i know he 's been here . you ca n't fool me , mister .
thomas ? who 's thomas ?
i 'm looking for my nephew , thomas .
the damn lock 's broken again . and so you just barge in on strangers , is that what you do ? is that your game ?
what do you mean , how 'd i get in ? i pushed the door and walked in . what do you think ?
how the hell did you get into the building ?
i just want to know what your game is , mister , that 's all .
what can i do for you ?
is your name paul benjamin ?
you shut your mouth ! you shut your mouth now !
louisa vail . remember her , cyrus ?
i do n't like this . i do n't like it one bit .
are you making fun of me ? i wo n't be mocked . do you hear me ? i wo n't let no punk kid stand there and mock me !
thomas cole . my name is thomas jefferson cole .
thomas .
paul . rashid . thomas . which one is it ?
thomas .
that 's how we met . we 're members of the international same name club . believe it or not , there are 846 paul benjamins in america . but only two in the new york metropolitan area . that 's how paul and i got to be such good friends . we 're the only ones who show up at the meetings .
yeah , but he 's my son . nothing strange about that . he 's my own flesh and blood . but here you got the same name as this man here , and you 're not even the same color .
well , you and junior have the same name , too , do n't you ?
that 's funny . his name is the same as yours .
say hi to paul .
hi there , little brother .
and this one , in case you have n't guessed , is junior .
it 's only temporary . on a freelance basis .
that boy 's one in a million . a real tiger .
you named the kid after yourself , huh ?
i do n't know . i try . every day i keep on trying , but it 's no easy task for a man to change his nature . i 'm off the booze , though . have n't had a drop in six years . and now i 've got me a wife . doreen . best damned woman i 've ever known . and a little boy , too . cyrus junior . so things have definitely improved since i got fitted with this hook . if i can just turn this goddamn garage around , i 'll be in pretty good shape .
and have you mended them ?
an ugly piece of hardware , is n't it ? i 'll tell you what happened to my arm . i 'll tell you what happened . twelve years ago , god looked down on me and said , `` cyrus , you 're a bad , stupid , selfish man . first of all , i 'm going to fill your body with spirits , and then i 'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car , and then i 'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you . but you , cyrus , i 'm going to let you live , because living is a lot worse than death . and just so you do n't forget what you did to that poor girl , i 'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook . if i wanted to , i could rip off both your arms and both your legs , but i 'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm . every time you look at your hook , i want you to remember what a bad , stupid , selfish man you are . let that be a lesson to you , cyrus , a warning to mend your ways . ''
i do n't mean to be nosy , but i was wondering what happened to your arm .
paul . paul benjamin .
the name is cyrus cole .
five dollars an hour ? i 'll take it .
i 'm afraid we 'll be working on a strictly freelance basis .
you know , health insurance , dental plan , paid vacation . it 's not fun being exploited . workers have to stand up for their rights .
benefits ?
is there a benefits package , or are you hiring me on a freelance basis ?
five bucks an hour . that 's the going rate , is n't it ? it 's a quarter past two now . my wife 's picking me up at five-thirty , so that 'll give you about three hours . if you ca n't finish today , you can do the rest tomorrow .
what 's your offer ?
i 'll tell you what . you want to work . i 'll give you a job . nothing permanent , mind you , but that upstairs room over there -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess . it looks like they 've been throwing junk in there for twenty years , and it 's time it got cleaned up .
yeah , well , do your thinking somewhere else , michelangelo . i got work to do .
it was just a thought .
not a one . not one customer all day . i bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago , and if business do n't pick up soon , i 'm going straight down the skids . what do i want to be hiring someone for ? i ca n't even pay my own wages .
not a one .
do you have eyes in your head , or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles ? you 've been sitting here all day , and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas ?
i just tell it like it is , mister . if i 'm getting on your nerves , though , you might want to think about hiring me .
son-of-a-bitch . you 're some piece of work , are n't you ?
once you look at it , you 're going to want to buy it from me . that 's guaranteed . and that 's the price : five bucks . so if you 're not willing to spring for it , you might as well not bother to look . it 'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable .
five bucks ! you mean you 're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it ?
it 'll cost you five bucks .
it 's rundown , all right . but drawing a picture wo n't improve the way it looks . let 's see what you did , rembrandt .
i 'm working on a sketch . that old garage of yours is so rundown , it 's kind of interesting .
just passing through . a lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view . there 's other places to roam , kid , that 's all i 'm saying . you do n't want to make a nuisance of yourself .
just passing through .
i do n't know what you look like , boy . as far as i can tell , you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night . you live in this town -- or on your way from here to there ?
i 'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?
let me give you some useful information , son . there 's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you 've put in casing the joint so far , you wo n't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains . however you slice it , that 's a losing proposition .
it 's a free country , is n't it ? as long as i 'm not trespassing on your property . i can stay here till kingdom come .
why do n't you pick some other spot ? it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning .
i do n't know . i have n't decided yet .
you going to sit here all day ?
an abortion , stupid . i had an abortion the day before yesterday . so you do n't have to bug me about that shit anymore . bye-bye , baby !
what are you talking about ?
yeah , well , there ai n't no baby in there now . you dig ? there 's nothing in there now .
your baby . the baby you 're carrying around inside you .
baby ? and what baby is that ?
you can do whatever you want with your own life . we 're thinking of the baby , that 's all . we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby . before it 's too late .
help ? what the fuck do i need your help for ? i 've got a man , do n't i ? that 's more than you can say for yourself , hawkeye .
be nice , sweetie . we 're just here to help you .
i do n't got no daddy , you dig ? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass .
i do n't know . hello , mom . hello , dad . something like that .
what do you want me to say ?
are n't you going to say anything ?
well what ?
well ?
it 's me , honey . it 's mom .
yeah ? who is it ?
i do n't know , tommy . you think anyone gives a rat 's ass about kuwait ? i read something about the head sheik over there . he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday . you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that ?
of course there 's gon na be a war . you think they 'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun ? i mean , there 's plenty of beach , but not a hell of a lot of water . half a million soldiers . it ai n't no seaside holiday , you can bet on that .
i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes . they came with a free gift coupon in every pack .
sure . he 's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle .
they did n't have to do a thing , that 's all i 'm saying . the team was good , the best fucking team in baseball . but then they had to screw it up . they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge . a mess of porridge .
jesus , tommy , it ai n't science , you know . you got your good trades and your bad trades . that 's how it works .
okay , joke about it . i do n't give a shit .
management . those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses .
yeah ? and why is that ?
i 'll tell you why they 're not going anywhere .
twelve-eleven . twelve-twelve . twelve-twelve .
so what 's the time ?
tick-tock , tick-tock .
you still have that watch auggie gave you ?
huh ?
hey , jimmy . you got the time ?
now ask him who his mother was .
like it or not , cyrus , that 's my name . cole . just like yours .
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time . in my own time ... .
if it does n't make any difference , why not just say it ?
it 's all right . i really do know them .
we came here to deliver some clean laundry .
research . i worked the scene right into my story . that makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible .
wow . they sure did a job on you .
hi , kid .
good . i 'm glad that 's settled !
fuck you , too , you white son-of-a-bitch .
do n't worry about it . you 've got friends now , remember ? just behave yourself , and everything will work out .
i pay auggie , and i 've got nothing . eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city .
you 'll do it , all right . you fuck up , you 've got to undo the damage . that 's how it works , buster . if you do n't do it , i 'm going to throw you out of here . do you understand me ? if you do n't pay auggie what you owe him . i 'm finished with you .
i 'm not going to do it .
i 'm serious , all right . you 've got to square it with auggie . since you wo n't give the money back to the creeper , you can use it to make things right with auggie . that 's probably better anyway . better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies .
what are you talking about ? you ca n't be serious .
here 's what you 're going to do . you 're going to open up your backpack , take out your bag of money , count out five thousand dollars , and hand it over to auggie .
he was out five thousand bucks , he said ... . he kept saying it over and over ... . five thousand bucks down the drain ... . he would n't stop ... . five thousand bucks , five thousand bucks ... . he was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks ... .
no wonder he was angry .
i suppose so . he never told me about it .
cuban cigars . you mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys ?
the water was dripping , see ... i turned it off , but it was still dripping , and then auggie had to go out , and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well , later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded . his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know , soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits ... .
if you do n't tell me what happened , how do you expect me to know that ? i need facts , not opinions .
it was n't my fault .
well ?
it was more complicated than that . there was a reason .
so you lost the job . is that what you 're telling me ? he just up and fired you ?
keep up with that attitude , and you wo n't have a future . seventeen is a hell of an age to die . is that what you want ?
that money is my whole future .
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you .
no way . there 's no way i 'm giving that money back . it 's my money now .
yeah , well , you have to be nuts to do what you did . if you want my opinion , you should give this money back to the creeper . just give it back and tell him you 're sorry .
that 's it . in a nutshell .
so you robbed the robbers , and now the robbers are after you .
six thousand dollars . five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars , to be exact .
you have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble , do n't you ? so how much does it come to ?
that 's just it . i did n't think . i just did it .
good thinking .
and started to run .
and started to run .
yeah , i picked it up .
christ . you did n't just see what happened . they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up .
not exactly . i mean , there was more to it than i told you .
so you 're saying it was n't like that at all .
here , catch .
yeah , it might be .
is it yours ?
i do n't know .
you do n't believe me , huh ? look , i 'll show you . it 's all in this book .
nice try . you had me going for a second , but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that . would he ?
his only copy . i mean , if you think you 're going to die , what 's more important , a good book or a good smoke ? and so he huffed and he puffed , and little by little he smoked his book .
his only copy ?
it 's 1942 , right ? and he 's caught in leningrad during the siege . i 'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history . five hundred thousand people died in that one place , and there 's bakhtin , holed up in an apartment , expecting to be killed any day . he has plenty of tobacco , but no paper to roll it in . so he takes the pages of a manuscript he 's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes .
absolutely . we would be honored .
yes , an invitation . i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute , but mr. benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight , and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us . is n't that right , mr. benjamin ?
excuse me for asking , but you are n't married , are you ?
uh , actually , i tend to shy away from that kind of thing .
pick two or three . now that the coffers are open , you might as well take advantage of me .
here we are . rembrandt 's drawings . edward hopper . van gogh 's letters .
i mean earlier . we could have planned something .
i just did .
hey , hey . happy birthday . why did n't you tell me ?
it 's my birthday . i 'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago , and i think i should celebrate having made it this far .
celebrate ? what for ?
no , not the end . the beginning . his son was just a little boy at the time , but the years passed , and when he grew up , he became a skier , too . one day last winter , he went out by himself for a run down the mountain . he gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock . just as he 's unwrapping his cheese sandwich , he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet . he bends down to take a closer look , and suddenly he feels that he 's looking into a mirror , that he 's looking at himself . there he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact , sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation . he gets down on all fours , looks right into the dead man 's face , and realizes that he 's looking at his father .
the end .
all right . listen carefully . about twenty-five years ago , a young man went skiing alone in the alps . there was an avalanche , the snow swallowed him up , and his body was never recovered .
no way .
yeah , right . the inspiration . it 's a true story anyway , so i do n't suppose it can hurt , can it ?
the inspiration .
okay , just a little hint . i ca n't tell you the story , but i 'll tell you what gave me the idea for it .
come on , just a little hint .
if i tell you , i might not be able to finish it .
that 's logical . and if you do n't sleep , you do n't need a bed . saves you money , too . so what 's this story you 're working on , anyway ?
if you do n't sleep , you do n't dream . if you do n't dream , you do n't have nightmares .
just so you do n't overdo it . you do n't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish .
once a story gets hold of you , it 's hard to let go . besides , i 'm making up for lost time .
you work too hard , you know that ?
i do n't know . two or three . it was pretty late .
what time did you get to bed last night ?
thanks .
one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open .
ah , coffee . smells good .
fair enough . we would n't want to get carried away , would we ? now call your aunt em and let her know you 're alive .
let 's not get too idealistic .
maybe . or maybe it 's the other people who do n't belong .
that 's because we do n't belong anywhere . you do n't fit into your world , and i do n't fit into mine . we 're the outcasts of the universe .
it looks like they 've met in this apartment .
it might not be far , but it 's another galaxy . black is black and white is white , and never the twain shall meet .
what makes you think you 'll be any safer around here ? it 's only about a mile away from where you live .
the man has friends . and they 're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him .
if they put this creeper in jail , then you 'd be safe .
you 're joking , right ? i mean , that 's your way of trying to be funny , right ?
why do n't you go to the police ?
i just happened to be walking by ... all of a sudden , the creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands ... they just about ran smack into me . the creeper recognized me , and i knew he knew i recognized him ... if the guy from the check-cashing place had n't rushed out then screaming bloody murder , he would have shot me . i 'm telling you , the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk . but the noise distracted him , and when he turned around to see what was happening , i took off ... one more second , and i would have been dead .
so that 's the something you were n't supposed to see , huh ?
i crossed paths with him . that 's why i 'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood . to make sure i do n't run into him again .
and ?
okay , okay . it 's all so stupid . there 's this guy , see . charles clemm . the creeper , that 's what people call him . the kind of guy you do n't want to cross paths with .
i do n't , huh ? and what makes you such an authority on what i want or do n't want ?
you do n't really want to know .
close the door . sit down in that chair . now listen carefully . your aunt em came here a couple of days ago . she was sick with worry , out of her mind . we had an interesting talk about you , thomas . do you understand what i 'm saying ? your aunt thinks you 're in trouble and so do i. tell me about it , kid . i want to hear all about it right now .
i do n't have much time .
cut it out , will you ? just cut it out and come back here .
business appointment . i 'm seeing my broker at three o'clock .
where the hell do you think you 're going ?
i bought it . twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at goldbaum 's tv and radio . well , that just about takes care of it , i guess . you 'll be able to watch the ball games . you know , as a little break from your work .
where did you get that thing ?
i do n't know . for helping me out .
appreciation for what ?
i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation .
hey , it 's you .
you too . and make sure the light is green before you cross the street . oh , by the way , i liked your book . i think you 're a hell of a good writer .
take good care of yourself , okay ?
not a penny , not a stitch . i 'm cool , man .
do you need some money ? some extra clothes ?
absolutely . the world is my oyster . whatever that means .
are you going to be all right ?
you do n't have to apologize . the coast is probably clear now anyway .
no hard feelings , okay ? it 's a small place , and i ca n't get my work done with you around .
i 'm sorry i messed up . you 've been very kind to me ... but all good things have to come to an end , right ?
it sounds like our time is up , does n't it ?
two or three nights .
and how long did i tell you you could stay ?
three nights .
how long have you been here ?
i did n't ask to come here . you invited me , remember ? if you want me to leave , all you have to do is say so .
it just wo n't do , will it ? i go two and a half years without being able to write a word , and then , when i finally get started on something , when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again , you show up and start breaking everything in my house . it just wo n't do , will it ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry ... i was trying to reach for one of the books up there ... and then , i do n't know , the sky fell on top of me .
if you want to steal it , that 's your business . at least i wo n't have you around here making noise . it might be worth it .
twenty dollars is a lot of money . are you sure you can trust me with it ? i mean , are n't you afraid i might steal it ?
the world is going to end pretty soon if you do n't learn fast . look , why not make yourself useful ? i 'm just about out of smokes . go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias .
i 'm a teenager . all teenagers are clumsy . it 's because we 're still growing . we do n't know where our bodies end and the world begins .
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice , do n't you think ?
i 'm sorry . they just ... they just slipped out of my hands .
jesus , do you make a lot of noise . ca n't you see i 'm trying to work ?
you 'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator . cereal in the cupboard . coffee on the stove . take whatever you want . but it 's time for me to get started in here .
eight-thirty ?
eight-thirty .
what time is it ?
time to wake up . hey , kid , time to wake up . rashid ! up and out . i have to work in here . the slumber party is over .
yeah , sometimes . i like to dabble , too .
is that what you do ? draw pictures ?
drawing 's a good thing .
twelve , thirteen years ago . actually , he died with his sketch pad open on his lap . up in the berkshires one weekend , drawing a picture of mount greylock .
he 's dead ?
no , he was a schoolteacher . but he liked to dabble .
is your father an artist ?
it 's strange , though , is n't it ? looking at yourself before you knew who you were .
yeah , i can believe it .
my father did . believe it or not , that little baby is me .
nice drawing . did you do that ?
i listen on the radio . i can see the games just fine that way . the world is in your head , remember ?
but then you do n't get to watch the ball games . you told me you were a mets fan .
i used to have one , but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it . i 'd just as soon not have one anyway . i hate those damn things .
this is the first house i 've been in without a tv .
that 's it . just the two rooms .
same here . but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon . you know , to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture , and he said it would be okay .
i did n't expect to see you again .
suit yourself . but if you change your mind , here 's the address .
i can take care of myself . do n't worry .
in case you 're wondering , i like women , not little boys . and i 'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights .
thanks , but i 'll manage .
i 'm not `` people . '' i 'm just me . and i do whatever i goddamn want to do . got it ?
people do n't do that kind of thing . not in new york .
but your body is in the world , is n't it ? if someone offered you a place to stay , you would n't necessarily refuse , would you ?
the material world is an illusion . it does n't matter if they 're there or not . the world is in my head .
except that there 's no bed , is there ? and no breakfast either .
yeah , that 's right .
uh-huh . one of those cozy bed and breakfast places , probably .
here and there . around .
you ca n't be more specific than that ?
the what . i 've kind of run away from home , you see . it has nothing to do with my parents or money . i saw something i was n't supposed to see , and for the time being it 's best that i keep myself out of sight .
the what ?
that 's where the what comes in .
then what are you doing in park slope ? it 's a little far from home , is n't it ?
of course . where else ?
in manhattan ?
east seventy-fourth street .
and where do momsie and popsie live ?
oh no . momsie and popsie have oodles .
that 's true . but i also owe you something , and i 'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job . what is it ? family problems ? money problems ?
you do n't know me from a hole in the wall .
you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to , but i might be able to help .
mostly what .
cocktail hour is over . the young man would like to order a hamburger .
well , maybe just one . to be polite .
look , kid , it 's okay with me . you do n't have to play games . if you want a hamburger or something , go ahead and order it .
just one bottle . i believe in moderation .
yeah , sure , and i bet you had lobster last night . along with two bottles of champagne .
i mean breakfast .
you must eat lunch pretty early . it 's only eleven o'clock .
that 's okay . i 've already had lunch .
are you sure you do n't want some food to go along with it ? it might help to absorb some of that liquid . you do n't want to slosh around too much when you stand up .
rashid . rashid cole .
good . lemonade it is . i 'm paul .
i do n't drink coffee . on the other hand , since you insist , if you offered me a cold lemonade . i would n't say no .
come on . at least let me buy you a cup of coffee .
that 's all right . if i think of something , i 'll send my butler over to tell you .
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance .
well , if you put it that way ...
yes it is . it 's a law of the universe . if i let you walk away , the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years .
it 's okay , mister . no big deal .
i owe you something .
i just happened to be there . the right place at the right time .
no , wait . you ca n't just walk off . you saved my life .
no harm done . everything 's okay now . i 've got to be going .
i ca n't believe i did that ... christ . i 'm walking around in a fog ...
watch out , man . you 'll get yourself killed like that .
i do n't mean to pry , but i see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back , and i begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions are n't stowed in there . are you in some kind of trouble or what ?
if you 're lucky . then again , it depends on what you call living .
i 'll take the iced coffee . you only live once , right ?
everything is real in here , honey . as real as the color of my hair .
do you have real iced coffee , or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes ?
hot coffee or iced coffee ?
yeah , give him another one . and i 'll take a cup of coffee while you 're at it .
you want another one of these , too ?
yes , please .
lettuce and tomato ?
yes , please .
fries ?
medium rare , please .
how do you want that cooked ?
did n't say i was buyin ' did i ? what you want down ? just bein ' curious , is all .
$ 1200 an acre , that 's what i paid ole , wo n't take a dime less . you got no choice on that .
hid it from my mom . caught a mess a sea runs . damn thing 's still in my closet .
oh , yeh ?
i am a bastard . i 'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch . and i still got your bamboo fishing rod .
... < u > might < /u > do the same . i have to warn you 'bout that , chief . i 'm not screwed together like i used to be .
the battery 's in , that 's done with . besides , you 'd do the same for m ...
what are you sellin ' 'em for ? why do n't we start there .
seven acres . i 'm wonderin ' what you 'd pay for 'em . just curious , is all .
keep it tonight . we 'll catch fish . i 'll see ya back on the docks ...
do n't know how long it 's take to get a charge ...
... or from the cut on his hand . which is more probable ?
i 'm a hemotologist , not a detective .
with no bone or scalp or hair present . would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man 's skull ...
you do n't .
i do n't know .
i 'm a hemotologist , sir , i was asked only t ...
well , if the blood got < u > onto < /u > the gaff by crushing a man 's skull ...
none .
no bits of bone , no particles of scalp , no strands of hair ?
bits of blood and wood . what else would there be ?
you scraped the dried blood from the < u > butt < /u > of the gaff . where a fella 's < u > hand < /u > goes . and what did you see under your microscope , besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings ... ?
that 's obvious .
and the blood could < u > not < /u > have belonged to defendant . seeing that his type is o negative .
no , but as i say , the type is rare . ten percent of caucasian males .
but you ca n't say with any certainty that the blood was his .
carl heine 's type .
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all . it was < u > human < /u > , yes ? type b positive .
did he see some < u > danger < /u > from defen ...
that he 'd keep an eye on miyamoto . watch out for him .
when your son came back from the war , what did he say about all this ?
well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he 's starin ' at me with these narrow eyes . givin ' me his mean face .
what do you mean by 'dirty looks ' ?
just showed up at my door , big as life and twice as mean . wanted to talk to my son .
and when he came home . did he write you about this ? or phone , perhaps .
in the war . europe , i believe . they could hardly send him to the pacific , could they ?
now defendant 's father had also died by that point . where was the defendant ? when you sent his family their equity .
their kids was born here . so when the oldest , that one there , was twenty ... last payment gets made , and he could own it .
why ? if they could never take title .
carl held it < u > for < /u > 'em . called it a lease . they make payments every june and december ...
but back in '34 , japanese-born could not < u > own < /u > land . so ... ?
they fished t'gether . went to school . carl junior treated him like a white person . like any friend .
so the defendant knew the deceased , your son , even then .
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land . lived in a picker 's cabin at first .
you done your math right .
it is .
is that your third question ?
so that makes what would have been $ 4500 into $ 7000 , does n't it ? if you sent the equity back , you had a profit of $ 2500 .
a thousand .
second question . what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre ?
tried to . defaulted on their payments .
just three questions . the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $ 4500 ?
well , it does seem mighty warm in here . specially for mr. hooks .
thank you , mr. gillanders . thank you for coming down , in this cold weather .
now , how is miyamoto gon na know in < u > advance < /u > ? that carl loses two batteries . must happen once ever ' 20 years or so .
well , what if ?
you mean miyamoto followed him out there , and sucker-punched him ?
all right , what if the defendant < u > heard < /u > ? so carl < u > let < /u > him aboard , to help . and < u > then < /u > the fishing gaff ?
compressed air horn , most likely . hope to god some man hears you in that fog .
course , if carl lost both batteries , dead in the water , his radio would n't work . so how would he signal for help ?
boat has two batteries . lose one you run off the other til morning . carl musta lost both , so miyamoto there gave him one a his .
no sense to have < u > any < /u > at all. , even the right size . it 's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car . nobody does .
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl 's well was carl 's own spare . even though it was too large f ...
could n't get on the boat . i 'd just < u > shoot < /u > the feller . < u > then < /u > tie up , throw him inta th ' drink . and skip bein ' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding .
so the fishing gaff method would n't make sense ?
i 'm sorry about that . it was n't mine in the first place .
it 's a joke . maneuver up to carl 's boat ? tie your lines fast ? come aboard ? all against carl 's will ? it 's the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of .
now if you wanted to kill a man . think you 'd try boarding against his will , and hitting him with a fishing gaff ?
unwritten rule of the sea . we do n't bother each other , stick to ourselves . ask anybody .
now , mister gi ...
i said . no further questions .
you 're implying th ...
question withdrawn , you may step down .
it seems human . to me .
does n't it seem to < u > you < /u > , mrs. miyamoto , that your mistake was in being deceitful ? concealing information during the course of a sheriff 's investigation .
well , it seems to me ...
we were afraid . silence seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake .
so you hid the truth . deliberately .
trials are n't only about truth , mr. hooks . even though they should be . they 're about what people < u > believe < /u > is true .
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .
why not ?
we discussed that . and decided not to .
up in the air ? was < u > that < /u > your reaction ?
yes , and then , what was there to call about ? everything was up in the air .
and then , something did . carl heine was found dead . with his head crushed .
of course not . we 're just not quick to run and boast . in case something went wrong .
you thought the deceased might ... break his promise ?
so , five hours . plenty of time for a call . he was 'excited ' , you say . in the sense of being 'overjoyed ' .
closer to eight .
your husband returned at , what , seven o'clock ?
we hear how carl ... passed away . only a few hours later .
so , then , you ... and your husband ... must have called friends , relatives , to tell them the amazing news . yes ?
happy for him . and relieved .
you were ... overjoyed yourself , to hear the news ?
i said 'excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .
it 's not for the . they only get to convict him .
i did . but the jury wo n't s ...
did you write that column ?
look , i < u > want < /u > to forget you , i do . i think if you hold me , just this once , i can walk away and never speak to you again .
you have to hear this , i can never touch you , ishmael . not once , not ever . there 's no half- way . as much as i know it hurts you , you have to let this go .
there 's no one here , and i 've < u > got < /u > to talk to you .
i 'm married , ishmael . it is n't right for us to be alone . people will t ...
the japs did it .
i 'm sorry about your arm . kabuo and i. are very sor ...
i could n't say anything . i just stood there , hating her .
i do n't mean everyone . just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them . or run a newspaper .
we all expect the world to be fair . as if we have some right t ...
look at my face . it 's the face of the people who did that . my father hardly speaks english . we 're in bad trouble , you have to see that .
it 's just pearl harbor . people are a little crazy , right n ...
it 'll be over soon . i can get you money .
my father ca n't get our money from the bank . we have a few dol ...
i lie to my parents every day . and every night .
there ca n't be any wrong in this , ha ...
well , i do n't do it for just anybody .
i can just feel my spirits soar .
why ? we 're only talking .
my mom . would be the problem .
we 're japanese , not mexican , ishmael . he 'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword .
your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .
the best part was that there was a 'this ' . to debate the wrongness of .
easy . slow is best .
i told myself that was good . that it made our friendship special . and did n't mean she was ashamed of it . necessarily .
at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .
he 's still got a good grip . we need to dig more .
... but he found you .
your father fought at belleau wood , it took him years to get over it . nightmares , tears , b ...
those are n't the facts that matter .
they 're not his neighbor , like you are . he is a husband , a father , he risked his < u > life < /u > for < u > their < /u > country . the same as you .
seattle boys think he 's guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
they only arrested that poor soul because he 's japanese .
you 've been busy with that trial , i suppose . such a travesty ...
i felt milholland 's report in my pocket . and wondered why i was n't telling her . telling someone . what i 'd found .
agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve , ma . we just do n't pretend we know .
you do n't believe in god anymore .
oh , in a heartbeat .
and your evaluation of the defendant ? could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff ? so quickly , there would be no sign of struggle ?
what else ? i had the boy teach me kendo . including ... the importance of the bow .
well , what then , sergeant ?
more than eager . he was out to make a point .
so . wide cross-section of men to evaluate . and the day that the defendant volunteered for this ... demonstration . did you find him eager ?
it was my specialty , sir , i trained several thousand over the years .
and you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat .
they were japanese-american boys , yes sir .
pretty darn clear .
and replaced it later with the new one . that 's your inference ?
you bet . and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off , he coulda left this line behind on carl 's boat .
so if defendant had tied up to deceased 's boat . with that last one . would those cleats have lined up ?
found on carl 's boat , too . starboard side , second cleat from the stern . but it does n't match carl 's lines . it matches miyamoto 's . perfect .
and the last ... ?
from carl heine 's boat . all his were like this one , three-strand manila , new condition , braided in loops . not bowlined like miyamoto 's .
and the next one ... ?
... comes off third cleat from the stern , port side . and it 's brand new . unlike the rest .
these are fishermen , alvin . they do n't talk at all to each other and less to me . specially gossip .
so , no ... immediate suspicion , no ... general talk of enmity between the two .
nossir . i 'd gone to tell the wid ... to tell mrs. heine .
and you were n't there , when the coroner examined the wound .
japanese stick-fighting . they 're trained as kids , y'know . to kill with sticks .
could you tell me what 'kendo ' is ?
well , i was a doctor in the jap theater , in the war . i saw those kendo wounds , < u > many < /u > times . looked exactly like this one .
and why . is that ?
i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes ... i 'd maybe look for a ... japanese person . with a bloody gun- butt . a right-handed fella , to be precise .
did you say more ?
he said , 'could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , 'you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? '
... so when the sheriff returned , you showed him the injury to the deceased 's head .
tht was summation , your h ...
your honor , < u > all < /u > of this is speculation . including mr. hooks ' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call .
objection !
you 're a hard man to trust , sir . you sit before us , with no expression , keeping a poker f ...
all right . what did your son < u > say < /u > to that effect ?
objection . asking witness to speculate about deceased 's state of mind .
my gosh , alvin , was i supposed to object every time you did that ?
objection , asking the witness to speculate .
as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man , and an assailant strong enough to subdue him ... that leaves only a < u > single < /u > overturned < u > cup < /u > in its wake ?
no , sir , i ca n't . not beyond a reasonable doubt .
< u > were < /u > you , sir ? can you < u > prove < /u > one word of all your fancy story ?
that 's curious . i was < u > appealing < /u > to their intelligence .
and i would n't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful . at a tactic that insults their intelligence .
that 's how journalists . answer questions .
i asked you a question , you 're writing a tract , h ...
he did n't want to lose any more .
greedy .
like you could n't believe .
your line of work . you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth .
oh , yes .
but is n't the < u > truth < /u > that there are < u > several < /u > other ways to explain < u > each < /u > of these twelve pieces .
then putting them together . so truth is revealed .
my expertise . is that i 'm a journalist .
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork . what is your expertise , sir , are you a detective of sorts ?
twelve .
well , the freighter . the twine . the blood . the knife . the cup . the watch . the second battery . the phantom lantern . the fishing gaff . the cracked gunnel . the skull wound . the blond hair . that 's < u > eleven < /u > things ...
i 'm sorry , was there a question in there ?
< u > everything < /u > had to happen < u > just < /u > right . for your little story to fly . i mean , a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a < u > lot < /u > of reasons .
objection ! speculation .
maybe it went . where carl went . over the side .
he said he did n't want that life no more . he 'd been saving to buy a farm . he was sorry i got sick . but pretty excited to get back his father 's place .
but carl was a fisherman . and successful at it .
carl heine came .
and then your stroke came this summer . and you put your property on the market , i believe you said september 7. which , remember , is < u > eight < /u > days before carl heine died . and who comes spetember 7 , wanting to buy ?
oh , yeh . but this is nine year ago , i had my healt , i was n't wantin ' to sell .
mr. jurgensen . did he offer to < u > buy < /u > the seven acres from you ?
oh , yeh . he said someday he would get his land back .
robbed . he was angry .
i had a spare battery in my shed . i brought it down , and put it in just before the sheriff showed up .
well , the sheriff found < u > two < /u > batteries in your well . if you left one with carl heine , how is that possible ?
yes .
did n't go anywhere else ? no errands , no purchases ? just straight to the boat . that 's the truth .
i slept til one-thirty , when my wife woke me up with the news . we talked for a few hours . i left at six and went straight to my boat .
i see . now what happened the day carl heine was found ? before your arrest .
you mean , this morning . the new story , the battery story . that one is the truth ? that 's a question , sir .
i have told the truth .
my apologies . do you regret not telling the truth ?
should have told 'everything ' . meaning , you should have told the < u > truth < /u > .
i should have told everything right away . i know that now , and i regret it .
well , 'initially ' is an interesting word , sir . you 'd < u > been < /u > arrested , you < u > had < /u > a lawyer , and you < u > still < /u > claimed ignorance !
yes . initially .
but even < u > after < /u > you had an attorney . you still claimed to know < u > nothing < /u > . claimed < u > not < /u > to have seen carl . am i correct ?
sheriff said right off , i was under suspicion . i did n't have a lawyer ...
actually , she said you had decided . decided < u > not < /u > not come forward .
as my wife testified , we were considering it .
some seaman 's loast report . stuffed in a cabinet , good as lost forever . no one knows .
they got transferred that day . out to cape flattery .
no , night of the 16th , morning the 17th . we replaced two guys named miller and milholland .
you mean , early morning the 16th ?
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16 .
how long you have this detail ?
shorthard the radio transmis- sions , write 'em up , file 'em in a cabinet . nobody ever looks . just take up space .
and you keep the records , or contribute to 'em .
since september . last guys got transferred .
you have the night watch ? on the radio .
do n't prove there was two lanterns . coulda been the one in the cabin .
it 's on the twine , too . but it 's not r ...
you 're right . i better use two .
you gon na climb that with one arm ?
have a look . at nothing .
here now , what are you fixin ' to do ?
it 's public record . if the public cares enough to read it .
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place .
wo n't take two .
you said three minutes .
three kids . what 's she going to do ?
i did . boy .
it 's a rare thing . takes a turning point .
we do n't let go , you s ...
naw , i 've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes .
you ever been strangled by a single hand ?
if i whistle . those boys 'll see you , and come runnin ' . < u > you 're < /u > the story today .
i 'll take two . one for later .
cigarette ?
well , anything coulda caused that .
the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely . we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel . just below the mast .
you think so ?
he hit his head . on the way in .
still and all . carl was a strong swimmer , he m ...
the freighter started through at 1:42. the sea water seeped into carl 's watch and stopped it . at 1:47 .
still a coincidence . timing and all .
the knife . what knife ?
then where 's the lantern ? and where 's the knife ?
but you < u > could < /u > be wrong . he < u > could < /u > have climbed up earlier .
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio , which is now working . same report milholland heard . and < u > that < /u > makes him get the lantern fast . before the freighter 's wake can bang it around .
maybe ... ?
coincidences happen . you run a yellow light < u > just < /u > as a car comes out of nowhere . split-second tragedy happens every day . or maybe ...
just as the freighter comes through ? is n't that quite a coincidence ?
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there . so he climbs up . to cut it down .
still lashed to the mast .
miyamoto gave him the battery , and left . carl 's boat was running , he goes back to fishing . but at some point , he thinks of the lantern ...
fell .
that 's when he fell .
because the second lantern , the one on the mast . was never found . so we have to ask ...
well , why does it ?
that 's what mr. miyamoto reported , and he 'd have no reason to lie . he could n't know that it would help his case .
now you believe there were < u > two < /u > lanterns when defendant arrived . one in carl 's hand . the second lashed to the mast .
well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong . it was < u > carl 's < /u > boat that was dead in the water . or he 'd never have put up the lantern .
tell us why that lantern would be so significant .
to my father . everything counts .
he 's looking down . and he 's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday . he 's proud of the man you are tonight . that 's what counts .
yes , he was .
your daddy . was quite a feller .
i 'm wondering how the judge is gon na like my waking up his old bones . in the middle of the night .
you 're wondering why i held it .
this tastes horrible , hmmn ?
no , you do n't .
it 's the way it happened , i know it is .
look , no way i 'm lettin ' you out there . in a half hour you could be in canada .
sheriff , i ca n't afford not to fish toni ...
sure . blood gets all < u > over < /u > your hand , sheriff , ask any fisherman .
you gaff with the < u > hook < /u > end . blood 's on the butt . where your hand goes .
sure you did . help me with this hold cover , willya ?
naw , i had that around for a while .
see you replaced a mooring line , lately . this one 's new .
i was checking the cables .
you always run with the well open ?
we have a warrant . to search your boat .
what for , sheriff ?
and what do you believe ?
i told your wife . trials are n't always so much about actual truth . as about what folks < u > believe < /u > is true . that 's sad . and it 's real .
you think that < u > is < /u > the truth .
i want you . to tell the truth .
you want me to say that .
you wo n't hear that from hooks . because the charge is < u > first < /u > -degree murder , which requires premeditation . he ca n't change the charge .
i 'm more a hot-blooded killer , huh ? like a soldier . like a samurai .
that you came upon carl by accident . like you said . gave him the battery . like you said . asked him about the seven acres . like you said .
and what 's that ?
i should show them an american ?
so every time you think about showing that jury strength . or honor or composure . or dignity .
mr. gudmundsson , we < u > know < /u > what that jury is looking at .
now this jury is gon na be lookin ' at the evidence with one eye . and at you with the oth ...
you 're wonderin ' ... how come i never ask . if you did it .
you would n't even see it move .
sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . right above your left ear .
bet there 's a few things you could teach me . kendo , for one .
i think you like learning .
you must think i like losing .
you mean , do i like to take the offensive ? or hang back and wait .
white or black ?
your daddy played . i asked , down at the japanese community center . you smoke cigars ?
what makes you think i play ?
< u > you < /u > said that . that was < u > your < /u > testimony .
even though a d-6 is too big , and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in . which makes it a peculiar choice . for a spare .
what else could it be ?
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6 , which must have been a spare .
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well . and a dead d-8 on the deck .
the damage was considerable . but she 's insured . thanks , again .
and her farmhouse ... ?
she 's alright , nels , thanks for asking .
how < u > is < /u > your mother-in-law ?
possible . but not darn likely .
operating this winch you 'd rarely operated before , doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds ... is it < u > possible < /u > . possible that he struck his head < u > after < /u > death . possible ?
you do n't . < u > remember < /u > .
he was heavy , but we were real careful . but i do n't remember him hitting anything , anywhere .
you do n't . < u > think < /u > so .
i do n't think so .
is it possible his head struck the transom , or the stern gunnel , or the net roller , as you were bringing him in ?
now you 've testified that the deceased was a heavy man , and hard to bring out of the net .
i believe so .
i 'm curious . the d-6 that was refitted into the deceased 's well . was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant 's ?
apparently .
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with < u > no < /u > spare battery , hmmn ?
no .
no spare .
two d-6 's . that 's the kind his well was fitted for .
sheriff , how many batteries and what size did you find on < u > defendant 's < /u > boat ?
it was dead . we had it tested . maybe the d-6 was the spare and he had to use it .
but he had a spare d-6 , you said . right there . why not use that ?
he 's done some on-the-spot refit- ting . you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d-6 .
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery . a d-6 is one inch wider than a d-8 . it would be too large for the deceased 's well .
it is .
you found three batteries , you say . a d-6 and d-8 in the well . and a spare d-8 on the cabin floor . correct ?
you have to wonder .
a little . yes . you have to wonder .
does it now ?
did n't think about it at the time . so no , it did n't strike me odd .
and yet you started the engine right up . with all those lights drawing all night , the batteries had that much charge . did that strike you odd ?
yessir , there 'd been real heavy fog .
i think you testified < u > all < /u > the lights were on . cabin , mast , net lights , picking lights ...
maybe .
right . in the middle . of the floor .
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin . and forgot the cup .
< u > yes < /u > , i 'm sure .
are you absol ...
absolutely not . probably one or two hours . four at the most .
yes , you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased 's right hand . the report says 'recent origin ' . how recent ? as much as 24 hours before death ?
can i say something , here ?
for the third time , yes .
but you are < u > certain < /u > that he died by drowning .
for certain , no .
< u > and < /u > that you ca n't say for < u > certain < /u > whether the head injury was sustained before or < u > after < /u > death ?
i already said that , b ...
is it fair to say that you do not know for < u > certain < /u > which it was .
sure , anything 's poss ...
is it possible ?
if the head was moving fast enough , but i do n't see how it could be .
so if his head struck something narrow and flat , the gunnel of a boat , a net roller , a fairlead , could that have ...
the same .
can you tell whether an object moved against the head , or the other way around ? or would both look the same .
obviously .
in your motorcycle example . those injuries are produced by the head being propelled < u > against < /u > an object . rather than the reverse , yes ?
your report says death by < u > drowning < /u > , which means he went into the water alive and breathing . and the report is accurate ... ?
well ...
meaning that he was n't murdered first , say on the deck of the boat , and then thrown overboard .
that 's < u > why < /u > the autopsy report identifies < u > drowning < /u > as the cause of death .
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that .
so this ... foam you found in the lungs . how does it get there ?
that 's all he said .
the question is more about the < u > defendant 's < /u > attitu ...
carl said he did n't like kabuo much anymore .
sorry about that , mrs. heine . shall i repeat the ques ...
you can speak for what he < u > said < /u > . just like you did for mr. hooks ...
i ca n't speak for him .
carl ever say < u > he < /u > got one ?
he had no reason to .
those 'dirty looks ' . defendant ever aim one of those at you ?
of course not . but it was emotional . a friend 's plea set against his mother 's attitude .
carl never lied .
i guess you 'd have to guess . not having been there with them . having to guess whether your husband 's report was word for word accurate .
so the defendant was encouraged to hope . or could have been .
not in those words .
well , he did n't say 'no ' , did he ? did n't say no hope existed .
i would n't say encouraged .
so your husband said he 's think it over . encouraged mr. miyamoto to believe he might sell to h ...
whatever the latest jargon is . mekum much better , much higher . for example , where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality , these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination . it 's < u > all < /u > aggression . sloan < u > real < /u > men ! church at ease , lieutenant . what if they fought ? a sudden silence . sloan raises her eyebrows , gives rubrick a look . frowning thoughtfully , mekum looks up . mekum you mean up there ? church go ahead , rube . tell todd to take him . mekum no ! they all look at mekum . is this the chink in the armor ? the new soldiers ca n't fight ? church `` no '' ? mekum not fair . no contest . send two more of your old ones up . now church , rubrick , and sloan are stunned . they exchange a glance . mekum go ahead .
spirit ? oh ! you mean `` aq '' ... '' aggressive qualities '' ?
melton , on the double ! up a chain ! melton sir ! melton takes a few easy strides , gracefully catches a chain mid- stride , and smarts up , climbing easily and twice as fast as todd . church , sloan , and rubrick crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters . three quarters of the way up , melton comes even with todd , then passes him . mekum , watching , smirks . church is watching too , and he 's still not satisfied . his brow is knit , something 's bothering him . angle high above , among the girders stonefaced , melton is resting an a `` platform '' on the chain , sixty feet up , beneath the girders , swaying gently . his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a `` platform '' on an adjacent chain ... only three feet away . their eyes meet , todd and melton alone together sixty feet up , three feet apart . neither man blinks , neither man flinches , neither man reveals anything at all ... low angle , looking up church considers the men high above , then to mekum . church what about ... spirit ?
maybe we could run some tests . kind of a comparison , the old and the new ...
such as ?
the sweep is just routine , not even police action . i 'd like to see some sort of ... meaningful evidence ...
that 's up to you field guys . h.q . wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in january .
well , the soldiers we 've got now , they 've been through all kinds of heavy shit ... and they 've always got the job done . now these new ones , these `` hot shots '' of yours ... what kind of action have they seen ? they < u > are < /u > battle-tested , are n't they ?
i ... see . i 'm not sure i quite get your ... point ...
... he used to say , `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
mmmmmm . weeell , you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying ...
as i said , in every way . physically and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you 99.4 .
improved ... how ?
never mind leaving your door open - i got a passkey .
beat it , buster .
it 's from satchel mouth at table seven . this is from me to you , doll .
bull fiddle .
which of you dolls is daphne ?

get lost , will you ?
wan na see my driver 's license ?

because i 'm working the night shift - and i got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there 's a lull -
why ?
listen , doll - what time do you get off tonight ?
bye .
forget it , doll . after all , you work here - i work here - and believe you me , it 's nice to have you with the organization .
i suppose you want a tip ?
okay , doll .
yes . and that one , too .

i do n't know - but i can feel it right here . that 's one good thing about ulcers - it 's like a burglar alarm going off inside you .
funny ? in what way ?
you know , bienstock , there 's something funny about those two new girls .
all right , girls - from the top again .
i beg your pardon .
all right , girls . who does this belong to ? come on , now . speak up . sugar , i warned you !
i thought i made it clear i do n't want any drinking in this outfit .
yes , sue ? what is it ?
clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
hi , mary lou - rosella - okay , dolores , get a move on - how 's your back , olga ?
me ? i 'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman .
those idiot broads ! here we are all packed to go to miami , and what happens ? the saxophone runs off with a bible salesman , and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant . i ought to fire you , bienstock .
my suitcase - with all my resort clothes .
a what ?
you girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials ?

pardon me , mr. bienstock - can i have my flask back ?
now cut that out , girls-none of that rough talk . they went to a conservatory .
no -- - how does it go ?
fresh !
upsy-daisy .
it 's entirely mutual .
you 're welcome .
thank you ever so .
you 're in berths 7 and 7a .
hey , she 's ticklish !
cut it out , girls . stop it . joe - josephine - help !
the one-legged jockey said - 'do n't worry about me , baby . i ride side-saddle . '
what did he say ?
- so the one-legged jockey said -
manhattans ? this time of night ?
okay .
it 's private . go away .
this a private clambake , or can anybody join ?
where were you guys ?
me and tiny , we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle .
what happened ?
they would n't be caught dead in chicago - so we 'll finish the job here . come on .
those two musicians from the garage !
same faces - same instruments - - and here 's your valentine 's card .
like i was telling you - little bonaparte is getting soft . he does n't have it here any more . used to be like a rock . too bad . i think it 's time for him to retire .
he even got charlie 's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated .
stop , or i 'll burst out crying .
say , boss - i been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that little bonaparte is real sore about what happened to toothpick charlie . him and charlie , they used to be choir boys together .
we 're not on the pier yet -
it 's all fixed ! osgood is meeting us on the pier -
there 's a convention , all right . there 's also the ladies ' morgue .
elope ? but there are laws - conventions -
tell him you 're going to elope with him .
what 'll i tell him ?
yeah , but they 're not watching yachts . come on - you 're going to call osgood .
did you hear that ?
first thing we got to do is get out of these clothes .
all right - so what do we do now ?
there you go with that we again .
we 'll walk . and if we have to , we 'll starve .
you crazy or something ? the place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you 're making like diamond jim brady ! how are we going to get out of here ? how are we going to eat ?
no tricks , no mirrors , nothing up my sleeve . it 's on the level this time .
what did we do ? joe , you 're not pulling one of your old tricks .
do n't worry . we did the right thing with it .
all right . what happened to our bracelet ?
what do you mean , your bracelet ? it 's our bracelet .
wait a minute - my bracelet . what happened to my bracelet ?
yeah - lets shove off .
i do n't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here .
i may throw up .
hello , my dearest darling . so good to hear your voice again .
hello , room 414 ? this is the ship-to-shore operator - i have a call for miss sugar cane .
drop her a postcard . any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
that 's when i was a saxophone player . now i 'm a millionaire .
since when ? usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth .
we ca n't just walk out on her without saying goodbye .
telephone call ? who 's got time for that ?
what do you think you 're doing ?
get me room 414 .
sugar ?
there 's our shaving stuff - and there 's sugar .
joe , if we get out of this hotel alive , you know what we 're going to do ? we 're going to sell the bracelet , and grab a boat to south america and hide out in one of those banana republics - the way i figure is , if we eat nothing but bananas , we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is , if we get out of the hotel alive . did we forget anything ?
but they 're from osgood . he wanted me to wear them tonight .
not that , you idiot .
okay , joe .
shut up and keep packing .
i tell you , joe , they 're on to us . they 're going to line us up against the wall and - eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames , and they 're going to take us to the ladies ' morgue , and when they undress us - i tell you , joe , i 'm just going to die of shame .
what ?
joe -
nag , nag , nag . look , we got a yacht , we got a bracelet , you got osgood , i 've got sugar - we 're really cooking .
what are you giving me with the omelette ?
so ? it 's going to break sugar 's heart when she finds out i 'm not a millionaire . that 's life . you ca n't make an omelette without breaking an egg .
it 's just going to break his heart when he finds out i ca n't marry him .
get it while you 're young . and you better fix your lips . you want to look nice for osgood , do n't you ?
i feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses .
daphne got a proposal tonight .
that 's some nerve !
wait a minute - lets not be hasty . after all , we do n't want to hurt poor osgood 's feelings .
naturally . you think my fiance is a bum ? now i guess i 'll have to give it back .
hey - these are real diamonds .
what engagement present ?
i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - i wish i were dead - i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - what am i going to do about my engagement present ?
look , jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you 're a boy !
but joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire !
jerry , listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it 's just not being done !
then we 'll get a quick annulment - he 'll make a nice settlement on me - i 'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
oh .
like right after the ceremony .
like when ?
oh , i do n't expect it to last . i 'll tell him the truth when the time comes .
you 're out of your mind ! how can you get away with this ?
we 've been discussing that . he wants to go to the riviera - but i sort of lean toward niagara falls .
like what are you going to do on your honeymoon ?
like what ?
jerry - there 's another problem .
his mother - we need her approval . but i 'm not worried - because i do n't smoke .
i 'll say there is !
look , stop treating me like a child . i 'm not stupid . i know there 's a problem .
jerry , you 'd better lie down . you 're not doing well .
security .
but you 're not a girl . you 're a guy ! and why would a guy want to marry a guy ?
why not ? he keeps marrying girls all the time !
jerry ! you ca n't be serious !
you think he 's too old for me ?
what are you talking about ? you ca n't marry osgood .
osgood proposed to me . we 're planning a june wedding .
what ?
i am .
congratulations . who 's the lucky girl ?
i 'm engaged .
what happened ?
have i got things to tell you !
hi , jerry . everything under control ?
i 'm just borrowing them . you 'll get them back tomorrow .
what are you doing with my flowers ?
oh , no . i 'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy .
tell him you get seasick on a yacht . play miniature golf with him .
do n't give me the musketeers ! how 'm i going to keep the guy ashore ?
because we 're pals - buddies - the two musketeers .
why do i let you talk me into these things ? why ?
come on , you can do better than that . give him teeth - the whole personality .
remember - he 's your date for tonight . so smile .
you can both go take a flying jump .
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you .
oh , no ! not tonight , josephine !
that 's right .
with me ?
he 's going to be ashore with you .
and where 's he going to be ?
no . i 'm going to be on that boat with sugar .
you 're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man ?
of course , you 're not . i 'm going .
fat chance ! you call him right back and tell him i 'm not going .
just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and rudy vallee .
oh , he does !
you got it made , kid . fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
what message ? what motorboat ?
yes , mr. fielding - you 'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what 's that you said ? oh - zowie ! i 'll give her the message .
i 'm a push-over for whom ? what is it ? who 's on the phone ?
and what are you trying to do to poor sugar ? putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent - nobody talks like that ! i 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
wise guy , huh ? trying to louse me up -
daphne , you 're bothering us .
you know - the old shell game .
daphne - go on - tell me all about him .
he 's not only got a yacht , he 's got a bicycle .
yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate .
i heard a very sad story about a girl who went to bryn mawr . she squealed on her roommate , and they found her strangled with her own brassiere .
this happens to me all the time in public .
you - you -
what is it , young lady ? what are you staring at ?
do n't get burned , daphne .
yeah - let her soak . come on .
yeah ? well , i 'm your fairy godmother - and i 'm keeping an eye on you .
what are you talking about ? sugar and me , we 're just like sisters .
i watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other 's lipstick -
me ? after sugar ?
what are you giving me with the flying fish ? i know why you want to stick around - you 're after sugar .
what 's the beef ? we 're sitting pretty . we get room and board - we get paid every week - there 's the palm trees and the flying fish -
all right , all right ! but how long can we keep this up ?
so you got pinched in the elevator . so what ? would you rather be picking lead out of your navel ?
but this is so humiliating .
listen , stupid - right now spats colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country .
we can get a job with another band . a male band .
how can we ? we 're broke .
you promised - the minute we hit florida , we were going to beat it .
blow where ?
i 'm tired of being a flag . i want to be a bull again . lets get out of here , joe . let 's blow .
they do n't care - just as long as you wear skirts . it 's like waving a red flat in front of a bull .
and i 'm not even pretty .
well , now you know how the other half lives .
i got pinched in the elevator .
what happened ?
you would n't hit a girl , would you ?
male and female - the moth and the flame - i ought to slug you !
break it up , girls ! daphne ! come on , help me !
it 's not my fault . i did n't invite them .
what 's going on here ? daphne - daphne -
good night , josephine .
good night , daphne .
then pull the emergency brake !
but suppose i lose ? suppose it 's an emergency ?
fight it .
but suppose i got to go - like for a drink of water ?
i just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive . there 'll be no buzzing around tonight .
what are you doing ?
i 'm a girl . i 'm a girl . i 'm a girl -
steady , boy . just keep telling yourself you 're a girl .
we would be caught dead with men . those rough , hairy beasts with eight hands - they all want just one thing from a girl .
oh , you do n't have to worry about that .
men ?
you tore it again !
look - no butter , no pastry , and no sugar !
boy , would i like to borrow a cup of that sugar .
forget it . one false move , and they 'll toss us off the train - there 'll be the police , and the papers , and the mob in chicago ...
how about the shape of that liquor cabinet ?
down , daphne !
bye , sugar . we been playing with the wrong bands .
polish ?
i changed it . it used to be sugar kowalczyk .
now you tore the other one .
this way , daphne .
you better come help me .
you 'd better go fix it .
tore off one of my chests .
done what ?
now you 've done it !
not there - that 's the emergency brake .
listen , stupe - no butter and no pastry . we 're on a diet !
when i was a kid , i used to have a dream - i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
watch it , daphne !
how about that talent ? this is like falling into a tub of butter .
i 'm josephine . sax .
hello , everybody . i 'm the bass fiddle . just call me daphne .
i never did like the name geraldine .
daphne ?
and i 'm daphne .
my name is josephine .
this time i 'm not going to let you talk me into something that ...
what are you afraid of ? nobody 's asking you to have a baby . this is just to get out of town . the minute we hit florida , we 'll blow this set-up .
who are we kidding ? look at that - look how she moves - it 's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor . i tell you it 's a whole different sex .
the name is josephine . and it was your idea in the first place .
it 's no use . we 'll never get away with it , joe .
with those legs ? are you crazy ?
i feel so naked . like everybody 's looking at me .
quit stalling . we 'll miss the train .
and it 's so drafty . they must be catching colds all the time .
must be the way their weight is distributed . come on .
how can they walk on these things ? how do they keep their balance ?
shave our legs , stupid .
shave ? at a time like this ? those guys got machine guns - they 're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave ?
we are going out of town . but we 're going to shave .
we got to get out of town . maybe we ought to grow beards .
the police ? we 'd never live to testify . not against spats colombo . wabash 1098 .
you going to call the police ?
that 's not far enough . you do n't know those guys ! but they know us . every hood in chicago will be looking for us -
as far away as possible .
where are we running , joe ?
not yet . but if those guys catch us , there 'll be blood all over . type o .
you do n't see any blood ?
they got the bull-fiddle .
i think they got me .
no - nothing . besides , it 's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
we did n't see anything - - did we ?
knock it off , will you ?
we could 've had three weeks in florida - all expenses paid . lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish ...
i 'll think of something . do n't crowd me .
it 's a hundred miles , joe - it 's snowing - how are we going to get there ?
it 's twelve bucks . we can get one of the overcoats out of hock .
all the way to urbana - for a one night stand ?
josephine and geraldine ! come on !
now you 're talking ! we pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves josephine and geraldine -
you 've flipped your wig !
but , joe - three weeks in florida ! we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
no . and he ai n't been eating so good , either . he 's got an empty stomach and it 's gone to his head .
yeah , that 's what he means . good old nellie ! i ought to wring her neck !
you mean it 's a girls ' band ?
we 're not too late , are we ?
nellie told us about it .
- type o .
right . we have the same blood type ...
so i had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion ... right ?
it did ? boy , did it ever !
do n't you remember ? he has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
with me ?
with you .
yeah - where were you ?
look at the bull fiddle - it 's dressed warmer than i am .
i thought you were n't talking to me .
greased lightning ! why do i listen to you ? i ought to have my head examined !
look , stupid , he 's ten to one . tomorrow , we 'll have twenty overcoats !
but we 'll freeze - it 's below zero - we 'll catch pneumonia .
i told you - it 's a sure thing .
sam the bookie ? nothing doing ! you 're not putting my overcoat on that dog !
shut up , will you ? i wonder how much sam the bookie will give up for our overcoats ?
of course , the landlady is going to lock us out - moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we ca n't borrow any more from the girls , because they 're on their way to jail -
quiet - i 'm thinking .
well , that solves one problem . we do n't have to worry about who to pay first .
do n't look now - but the whole town is under water !
suppose lake michigan overflows ?
hey , joe !
suppose mary pickford divorces douglas fairbanks ?
jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black ? suppose you get hit by a truck ? suppose the stock market crashes ?
but suppose it does n't ?
what are you worried about ? this job is going to last a long time .
but suppose he loses ?
look at those odds - ten to one . if he wins , we can pay everybody .
what are you giving me with the rabbit ?
he 's a shoo-in . i got the word from max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
you 're going to bet my money on a dog ?
first thing tomorrow we 're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on greased lightning .
we 're not ?
no we 're not .
first thing tomorrow we 're going to pay everybody a little something on account .
of course i am .
you 're right , joe .
how can you be so selfish ? we owe back rent - we 're in four eighty-nine bucks to moe 's delicatessen - we 're being sued by three chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we 've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
it 's just a little inlay - it does n't even have to be gold -
dentist ? we been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week 's pay on your teeth ?
because i lost a filling in my back tooth . i got ta go to the dentist tomorrow .
yeah . why ?
i mean , we get paid tonight , do n't we ?
i 'll say .
say , joe - tonight 's the night , is n't it ?
that 's what i call a louse ! if i were you , sugar , i 'd throw that bracelet right back in his face .
he 's going to south america to marry some other girl - that 's what they call high finance .
thirty-four .
junior gave it to me . it must have at least thirty stones -
i always did .
you like it ?
how did you get that bracelet ?
and talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries .
what for ?
of course not . as a matter of fact , it was just the other way around . you see he needs help .
did he get fresh ?
i know what you need - a slug of bourbon .
i thought i heard voices - and i just had to talk to somebody . i do n't feel like going to sleep .
yes .
no !
yes . he wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he 's going to pick me up at the pier .
no !
what do you think , josephine ? what does it say in your crystal ball ?
i hope so .
what do you mean , maybe ? i saw the way he looked at you . he 'll be there for sure .
i met one of them .
oh , come on - you can do better than that .
that 's it . something tells me she 's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit .
do you suppose she went out shopping ?
yeah . this is one for ripley .
believe it or not - josephine predicted the whole thing .
no , no , sugar - wait . i have a feeling she 's going to show up any minute .
well , i 'll come back later .
that 's funny . josie - i ca n't imagine where she can be .
i guess she 's not in here .
josephine -
oh yes , we do !
we do n't have to run .
neither can i. come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now .
will she be surprised . i just ca n't wait to see her face -
yeah - josephine .
if i 'd been watching my step , i never would have met him . wait till i tell josephine .
sugar , dear - let me give you some advice . if i were a girl - and i am - i 'd watch my step .
now look , daphne - hands off - i saw him first .
well , i 'll be - ! how about that guy ?
come on , daphne .
oh , please do come . do n't disappoint us . it 'll be such fun . and bring your yacht .
or was it bryn mawr ?
i 'm a what ?
it sleeps twelve . this is my friend daphne . she 's a vassar girl .
his yacht ?
vanity fair ?
i recognized him too - his picture was in vanity fair .
okay .
run along , daphne - i 'll catch up with you .
come on , sugar - time to change for dinner .
you 're so flat-chested . clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me .
what 's that ?
but there 's one thing i envy you for .
that 's from carrying around the bull fiddle .
i mean , your shoulders - and your arms -
you should have seen me before i went on a diet .
you know , daphne - i had no idea you were such a big girl .
just a little trick i picked up in the elevator .
what do you think you 're doing ?
she 'll rub it on me - and i 'll rub it on her - and we 'll rub it on each other - bye .
oh , i have some suntan lotion .
we 'll rent some at the bathhouse . how about you , josephine ?
see ? she does n't have one either - you do n't ?
you betcha .
a bunch of us girls are going for a swim . want to come along ?
here you are , sugar .
thank you , daphne .
i 'll carry the instruments .
i 'm just going to get some ice .
not you , sugar .
oh , sugar . you 're going to spoil my surprise .
and bring the cocktail shaker .
we have some bourbon - lets make manhattans .
who needs vermouth ?
no fair guessing .
here . this 'll put hair on your chest .
we better have a drink first .
when ?
uh-uh . not yet .
what 's the surprise ?
so spill it . spills , thrills , laughs , games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party .
i may spill something .
no - no lights . we do n't want anyone to know we 're having a party .
you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing .
i tell you - this is the only way to travel .
half-full .
how 's the bottle ?
i 'm fine .
you all right ?
i know where to get some . do n't move .
you got some ?
look , sugar , if you feel you 're coming down with something , the best thing is a shot of whiskey .
i have a very low resistance .
i 'm not that sick .
maybe i 'd better go before i catch something .
i 'm a very sick girl .
what did you say ?
i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl -
let me warm them a little . there - is n't that better ?
is n't that ridiculous ?
and you 've got cold feet .
that 's ridiculous .
and your head is hot .
that 's ridiculous .
why you poor thing - you 're trembling all over .
no , no .
anything wrong ?
interesting .
when i was a little girl , on cold nights like this , i used to crawl into bed with my sister . we 'd cuddle up under the covers , and pretend we were lost in a dark cave , and were trying to find out way out .
no . it 's nice and cozy .
i 'm not crowding you , am i ?
stay as long as you 'd like .
i 'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep .
we wo n't tell anybody - not even josephine .
i do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots .
sssh . sweet sue .
and that 's one of them .
oh , i can think of a million things -
if there 's anything i can do for you -
it must be freezing outside . when i think of you - and your poor ukulele -
if it had n't been for you , they would have kicked me off the train . i 'd be out there in the middle of nowhere , sitting on my ukulele .
it 's nothing . i just think us girls should stick together .
i wanted to thank you for covering for me . you 're a real pal .
oh - sugar !
honey - she called me honey .
good night , honey .
good night , sugar .
see you around , girls .
i 'll say .
are my seams straight ?
i do n't want you to think that i 'm a drinker . i can stop any time i want to - only i do n't want to . especially when i 'm blue .
we 'll take a rain check .
i do n't really have much of a voice - but then it 's not much of a band , either . i 'm only with 'em because i 'm running away .
she sings , too .
i 'm sugar cane .
that 's us . i 'm daphne - and this is josephine .
that 's all right . i was afraid it was sweet sue . you wo n't tell anybody , will you ?
terribly sorry .
oh !
i 'm sorry . i was having a nightmare . something i ate . i 'm not at all well . see ? hot water bottle .
what 's the big idea ?
i was it .
i thought you said three years .
yes . for a whole year .
did n't you girls say you went to a conservatory ?
oh - those . i do n't know . mice ?
how did those holes get there ?
oh - here and there - and around .
where did you girls play before ?
this is our manager , mr. bienstock . i 'm sweet sue .
brand new .
look , if william morris does n't come through -
hello , mr. morris ? this is poliakoff , in chicago . say , you would n't have a couple of girl musicians available ? a sax player and a base ?
what 's with him - he drinks ?
wait a minute , joe . lets talk this over . why could n't we do it ? last year , when we played in that gypsy tearoom , we wore gold earrings . and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band ? grass skirts !
yes , i 'm holding on .
we could -
- and you got to be girls .
we could dye our hair .
- you got to be blonde -
we could pass for that .
you 're the wrong shape . goodbye .
what 's wrong with us ?
the florida job ?
it 's about the florida job .
well - nobody 's perfect .
but you do n't understand ! i 'm a man !
we 'll adopt some .
and i can never have children .
i forgive you .
and i have a terrible past . for three years now , i 've been living with a saxophone player .
i do n't care .
and i smoke . i smoke all the time .
it does n't matter .
well , to begin with , i 'm not a natural blonde .
why not ?
oh , no you do n't ! look , osgood - i 'm going to level with you . we ca n't get married at all .
we can have it altered .
osgood - i ca n't get married in your mother 's dress . she and i - we ' not built the same way .
i called mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it 's white lace .
flower girl .
another bridesmaid ?
come one !
pleased to meet you .
this is my friend josephine - she 's going to be a bridesmaid .
sorry .
you 're leading again .
yes , osgood ?
daphne ...
you 're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself .
you know something , mr. fielding ? you 're dynamite !
they got a cuban band that 's the berries . why do n't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn ?
about that roadhouse -
who ?
well , i 'll be - ! he does have a bicycle .
well , then , why do n't we go dancing ? i know a little road-house , down the coast -
i 'll throw up !
but it 's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
no , thank you . i 'll walk .
please . it wo n't happen again .
oh , you do n't get off that easy .
this is where i get off .
goodbye ?
goodbye , mr. fielding .
she does n't approve of girls who smoke .
why ?
my last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know , sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - zowie ! - but mama broke it up .
wan na bet ?
you must be quite a girl .
most of the time i slap it .
fascinating . do you use a bow or do you just pluck it ?
bull fiddle .
oh , of course . which of these instruments do you play ?
sorry . i 'll be on the bandstand .
if i promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight ?
well , pull in your reel , mr. fielding . you 're barking up the wrong fish .
so this year , when george white 's scandals opened , she packed me off to florida . right now she thinks i 'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing .
i 'm not surprised .
mama is keeping score . frankly , she 's getting rather annoyed with me
you 're not sure ?
no - it 's showgirls . i 've been married seven or eight times .
you invest in shows ?
yes , indeed . it 's cost my family quite a bit of money .
you do n't say .
you know , i 've always been fascinated by show business .
personally , i 'm type o .
it certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here .
thank you . are n't you a sweetheart ?
let me carry one of the instruments .
me too . bye now .
if there is one thing i admire , it 's a girl with a shapely ankle .
i am cinderella the second .
i am osgood fielding the third .
help yourself .
just a moment , miss - may i ?
that 's good thinking . daphne 's a push-over for him .
oh , that 's all taken care of . i 'm giving them shore leave . we 'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and i checked with the coast guard - there 'll be a full moon tonight - oh , and tell her i got a new batch of rudy vallee records -
just the two of you ? what about the crew ?
the new caledonia . that 's the name of it . the old caledonia went down during a wild party off cape hatteras . but tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us .
got it . supper - yacht - after the show - i 'll tell her . your yacht ?
well , it is to me . will you give her a message ? i 'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight .
this is her roommate . daphne ca n't talk right now . is it anything urgent ?
oh , no !
i do n't mean to be forward - but ai n't i had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before ?
you wo n't breathe nothing ' - not even air .
we wo n't breathe a word .
i do n't like no witnesses .
you ai n't going nowhere .
to urbana . it 's a hundred miles .
wait a minute . where do you think you 're going ?
we 're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - nellie weinmeyer 's car - there 's a dance tonight - come on , jerry .
do n't i know you two from somewhere ?
my car ? why , you -
good ! then you wo n't be needing your car .
yes , joe .
and you 'll be in all evening ?
i 'm not doing anything . i just thought i 'd go home and have some cold pizza -
because i got some plans -
why ?
please , jerry - that 's no way to talk . nellie baby - what are you doing tonight ?
it 's three weeks in florida -
what 's the job ?
the minute we get a job , i 'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
you 're making it up pretty good so far .
nellie baby , i 'll make it up to you .
oh ?
what a heel ! i spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled , i buy me a new negligee , i bake him a great big pizza pie ... - and where were you ?
now look , nellie - if it 's about last saturday night - i can explain everything .
thank you .
oh , it 's you ! you got a lot of nerve -
anything today ?
you got it . it 's six dollars a man . be on the campus in urbana at eight o'clock -
we 'll take it !
look , if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight - at the university of illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a st. valentine 's dance .
william morris !
no , we could n't !
you got to be under twenty-five -
what kind of band is this , anyway ?
it 's not the backs that worry me .
the wrong shape ? you looking for hunchbacks or something ?
the instruments are right , but you are not . i want to speak to mr. morris .
you need a bass and a sax , do n't you ?
what are you - a couple of comedians ? get out of here ! long distance ? get me the william morris agency in new york .
nellie , get me long distance . what is it ?
hey , sig - can we talk to you ?
there are two things i will not put up with during working hours . one is liquor - and the other one is men .
we got time off for good behavior .
all right - lets take it from the top . and put a little heat under it , will you ?
we got it second-hand .
would you mind rejoining the living ? goose it up a little .
no - funerals .
hey , sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances ?
yes , we 're the new girls .
you two from the poliakoff agency ?
well , here we are .
that 's right - pour it on . talk me out of it .
do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
i know . every time !
you do n't want me , sugar - i 'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you 've been running away from -
i told you - i 'm not very bright .
sugar ! what do you think you 're doing ?
how can i ? no matter where i go , there 'll always be a shell station on the corner . i 'll bring this back when it 's empty .
you 'll forget him , sugar .
he was the first nice guy i ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything .
daphne -
i do n't know . all of a sudden , i 'm thirsty .
what 's the matter , sugar ?
goodbye , my darling .
well , anchors aweigh , you have a bon voyage . and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding , we 'll be through here in a couple of weeks .
oh . the navigator just came in - we 're ready to cast off .
i did n't do anything . it just happened .
not always . but i want you to know i 'm very grateful for what you did for me .
real diamonds . they must be worth their weight in gold . are you always this generous ?
what 's what ? oh , that . just a little going away present .
yes , they 're here . oh - white orchids . would you believe it - i have n't had white orchids since i was a debutante . what 's this ?
smart move . oh , by the way - did you get my flowers ? you know , those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over long island , and they flew them down this morning .
but you have . you 've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow i 'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of venezuelan oil .
i only wish there were something i could do for you .
i knew you would .
oh , of course . i understand . at least , i think i do .
according to our tax advisers , she 's only so-so . but - that 's the way the oil gushes . a man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
oh - that kind of a merger . is she young ? pretty ?
it 's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter , and -
you 're not ?
quite a while . as a matter of fact , i 'm not coming back at all .
a merger ? how long will you be gone ?
you see , we have those oil interests in venezuela - and i just got a cable from dad - the board of directors decided on a merger .
where to ? south america ? oh . that is unexpected .
not tomorrow , either . you see , i have to leave - something unexpected came up - i 'm sailing right away .
tomorrow night ?
i 'm afraid not . i ca n't make it tonight .
i 'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show .
yes . now about our date for tonight ...
that 's funny - i never slept better . and i had the most wonderful dream . i was still on the yacht , and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and i was the crew - i kept a lookout for icebergs , and i sorted your shells , and mixed your cocktails , and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when i woke up , i felt like swimming right back to you .
daphne has a beau - i have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you .
me ?
that 's wonderful . poor josephine .
from a rich millionaire .
really ?
i 'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - i think he 's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve .
gee , i wish i 'd been there .
nice ? it was suicidally beautiful .
did you have a nice time ?
oh , no . i 'm off that stuff - for good .
let 's make it an even million .
eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
how much do i owe the milk fund so far ?
good morning .
good night .
oh , you know - junior league - charity bazaars - i used to sell kisses for the milk fund .
where did you learn to kiss like that ?
mineral baths - now really !
they told me i was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you 're making a chump out of all those experts .
thank you .
i never knew it could be like this .
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up .
i think you 're on the right track .
lets throw another log on the fire .
i got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame .
i 'm not quite sure . try it again .
well - ?
so inhale !
it 's like smoking without inhaling .
you 're not giving yourself a chance . do n't fight it . relax .
look , it 's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it 's no use . i think the light switch is over there - - and that 's the radio . it 's like taking somebody to a concert when he 's tone deaf .
would you like a little more champagne ? and maybe if we had some music - - how do you dim these lights ?
i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .
anything this time ?
all right - if you insist .
i may not be dr. freud or a mayo brother or one of those french upstairs girls - but could i take another crack at it ?
what is it ?
would you do me a favor ?
if i ever found a girl that could - i 'd marry her like that .
do n't talk like that . i 'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
i have . spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back - - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i were n't such a coward , i 'd kill myself .
maybe if you saw a good doctor ...
thanks just the same .
is that anything ?
why ?
have you ever tried american girls ?
my family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston - imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money !
is it that hopeless ?
what else is there for me ?
how can you think about food at a time like this ?
yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it ? mint sauce or cranberries ?
you poor , poor boy .
ever since then - numb - no feelings . like my heart was shot full of novocaine .
talk about sad .
yes . eight hours later they brought her up by mule - i gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - type o - it was too late .
oh , no !
well , it was my freshman year at princeton - there was this girl - her name was nellie - her father was vice-president of hupmobile - she wore glasses , too . that summer we spent our vacation at the grand canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge , watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - i took off my glasses - i took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
oh , you could n't possibly .
i do n't want to bore you .
what happened ?
not anymore . i was in love once - but i 'd rather not talk about it . how about a little cold pheasant ?
you mean you ca n't fall in love ?
oh , it 's not your fault . it 's just that every now and then mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve . something goes wrong inside .
that makes me feel just awful .
complete washout .
nothing at all ?
see ? nothing .
have i ? i 'm trying all the time .
have you tried ?
it 's more like a mental block . when i 'm with girls , it does nothing to me .
you mean - like frigid ?
they just sort of leave me cold .
what thing ?
well , i do n't know how to put it - but i have this thing about girls .
harmless - how ?
oh , it 's not that . it 's just that i 'm - harmless .
well , of course , i 'm sure you 're a gentleman .
you 're flattering me .
it 's not the icebergs . but there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this .
oh , it 's perfectly safe . we 're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the coast guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around .
you know , i 've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean .
completely .
you mean we 're alone on the boat ?
it 's the crews ' night off .
what 's on thursdays ?
yea , of course . now where could they have put it ? on thursdays , i 'm sort of lost around here .
where 's your shell collection ?
i 'll say . i had two ponies drowned under me .
water polo - is n't that terribly dangerous ?
trophies . you know - skeet-shooing , dog-breeding , water polo ...
look at all that silverware .
bon voyage .
down the hatch - as we say at sea .
i do n't mind if i do .
champagne ?
they shrink when they 're marinated .
a herring ? is n't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars ?
oh - a member of the herring family .
what is it ?
caught him off cape hatteras .
what a beautiful fish .
it 's all right for a bachelor .
it 's exquisite - like a floating mansion .
of course . on thursdays , they always serve me in the small salon .
oh - in here .
yes - that 's our hurricane cellar .
oh , you have an upstairs and a downstairs .
yes - now let 's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up ?
love it . which way ?
well , that depends - on whether you 're coming or going - i mean , normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that 's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne ?
my dad is more interested in railroads . baltimore and ohio . which is the port and which is the starboard ?
mother keeps hers in southampton - and dad took his to venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line .
three ?
just regulation size . we have three like this .
it looked so small from the beach - but when you 're on it , it 's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer .
it 's not how long it takes - it 's who 's taking you .
do you mind riding backwards ? it may take a little longer -
looks like they 're on the wrong track .
i just got this motorboat - it 's an experimental model .
it 's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean , shell oil and everything -
i seem to be out of gas .
it 's the thought that counts .
i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in .
thank you . and thank you for the flowers .
it 's not how long you wait - it 's who you 're waiting for .
been waiting long ?
oh , josephine - just imagine - me , sugar kowalczyk , from sandusky , ohio , on a millionaire 's yacht . if my mother could only see me now -
you heard her - yes .
for me ? it 's shell oil .
well , you know how those millionaires are . these came for you .
i guess he 's not going to show up - it 's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot ?
because he said he 's coming to hear us play - maybe .
i am ?
anyway , you 're going to meet him tonight .
shells ? whatever for ?
oh , i 'm not going to let this one get away . he 's so cute - collects shells .
maybe you 'd better go after him - if you do n't want to lose him .
well , he 's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he 's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers .
you do n't say !
shell oil , junior . he 's got millions - he 's got glasses - and he 's got a yacht .
one of whom ?
they repealed prohibition ?
guess !
what ?
the most wonderful thing happened -
oh , i did n't hear you come in .
josephine .
if it 's at all possible -
and you will come to hear us tonight ?
it 's been delightful meeting you both .
well , i guess i 'd better go -
yes , you 're in the way . he 's waiting for a signal from his yacht .
would you mind moving along , please ?
please - no names . just call me junior .
shell oil ?
yes . so did my father and my grandfather - we 've all had this passion for shells - that 's why we named the oil company after it .
you collect shells ?
it 's on the account of the shells . that 's my hobby .
oh ?
i only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out .
why ?
i 'd like to - but it may be rather difficult .
i thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play .
tonight ?
maybe i 'll tell you when i know you a little better . what are you doing tonight ?
what theory ?
you see , i have this theory about men with glasses .
i beg your pardon ?
you 're very kind . i 'll bet you 're also very gentle - and helpless -
you know , it 's amazing we never ran into each other before . i 'm sure i would have remembered anybody as attractive as you .
- and always the same four hundred .
- riding to hounds -
- opening of the opera -
- inauguration balls -
they do indeed . daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent , but i do n't care . it was such a bore - coming-out parties , cotillions -
good school ! and your family does n't object to your career ?
so do i. as a matter of fact , i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music .
oh . well , i guess some like it hot . but personally , i prefer classical music .
yeah . real hot .
syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz ?
oh , yes . quite . you know - vassar , bryn mawr - we 're only doing this for a lark .
you 're society girls ?
well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel . sweet sue and her society syncopators .
for your own amusement ?
no - the ukulele . and i sing .
could be . do you play the market ?
i 'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a hundred thousand dollars .
up , up , up .
how 's the stock market ?
that 's very interesting .
well , i 'm not .
i 'm not interested at all .
no , my cocktail steward . look , if you 're interested in whether i 'm married or not -
and who mixes the cocktails - your wife ?
no , my flag steward .
i quite agree . tell me , who runs up that flat - your wife ?
certainly not . with all that unrest in the world , i do n't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve .
which one is yours - the big one ?
you have a yacht ?
they run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it 's time for cocktails .
your view of what ?
would you mind moving just a little ? you 're blocking my view .
that must be it .
possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - vanity fair -
your face is familiar .
not at all .
are you staying at the hotel ?
not very likely .
have n't i seen you somewhere before ?
now , really -
who are you ?
thank you .
well , do n't worry . i wo n't sue you - no matter who you are .
because usually , when people find out who i am , they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer , and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars .
why ?
i wish you 'd make sure .
i do n't think so .
you 're not hurt , are you ?
my fault .
oh , i 'm terribly sorry .
she does n't need one . i do n't have one either .
wait a minute , daphne . you have n't got a bathing suit .
just my feminine intuition .
what makes you so sure ?
forget it , sugar , will you ? forget about saxophone players . you 're going to meet a millionaire - a young one .
what else ? and was i ever crazy about him . two in the morning , he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad , so i brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face .
saxophone player ?
414 - that 's the same room number i had in cincinnati - my last time around with a male band . what a heel he was .
so do i. but do n't worry - we 'll be seeing a lot of each other .
i wish they 'd put us in the same room .
seventy-five . that 's three-quarters of a century . makes a girl think .
i 'll bet there is n't one of them under seventy-five .
well , there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at .
good night , sugar .
thanks , honey .
not at all .
would you mind terribly ?
want to switch berths with me ?
bienstock . he snores to beat the band . we cut cards to see who sleeps over him , and i always lose . would n't you know ?
why not ?
i might as well stay in there . i wo n't be able to sleep anyway .
okay , sugar - all clear . you better go back to bed .
search me . i mean - i 'll see .
what 's happened ?
i hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop .
happy days .
they get those weak eyes from reading - you know , all those long columns of tiny figures in the wall street journal .
well , now that you 've mentioned it -
men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless . have n't you ever noticed ?
glasses ?
i want mine to wear glasses .
yeah . with money like rockefeller , and shoulders like johnny weismuller -
maybe you 'll meet one too , josephine .
you 're entitled .
oh , i do n't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste .
going to catch yourself a rich bird ?
millionaires . flocks of them . they all go south for the winter . like birds .
what 's in florida ?
about the future . you know - like a husband ? that 's why i 'm glad we 're going to florida .
about what ?
that 's a quarter of a century . makes a girl think .
you are ?
you know i 'm going to be twenty-five in june ?
i can tell you one thing - it 's not going to happen to me again . ever . i 'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop .
brains are n't everything .
so you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job , and the next saxophone player , and it 's the same thing all over again . see what i mean ? - not very bright .
men !
then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone , and all that 's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste , all squeezed out .
you do n't say ?
you do n't know what they 're like . you fall for them and you love 'em - you think it 's going to be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin - and the next thing you know they 're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
yeah .
that 's why i joined this band . safety first . anything to get away from those bums .
yeah .
but you 're a girl , thank goodness .
you know - i play tenor sax .
every time !
that so ?
especially tenor sax . i do n't know what it is , but they just curdle me . all they have to do is play eight bars of `` come to me my melancholy baby '' - and my spine turns to custard , and i get goose-pimply all over - and i come to them .
really ?
you see , i have this thing about saxophone players .
bingo ?
i ca n't trust myself . the moment i 'd start with a new band - bingo !
you ca n't trust those guys .
i 'll say .
rough ?
that 's what i 'm running away from . i worked with six different ones in the last two years . oh , brother !
me ?
have you ever been with a male band ?
afford it ?
i used to sing with male bands . but i ca n't afford it any more .
then why did you take this job ?
no , just dumb . if i had any brains , i would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band .
i would n't say that . careless , maybe .
i 'm not very bright , i guess .
if bienstock catches you again - what 's the matter with you , anyway ?
better keep a lookout .
sugar , you 're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble .
put it here .
all the girls drink - but i 'm the one that gets caught . that 's the story of my life . i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop .
we understand .
do n't get me started on that . want a drink ? it 's bourbon .
running away ? from what ?
i play the ukulele . and i sing too .
oh .
on the baltimore and ohio .
where did he conduct ?
yes . i come from a very musical family . my mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor .
if they catch me once more , they 'll boot me out of the band . you the replacement for the bass and the sax ?
tell what ?
show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three .
where are they holding the wake ? i 'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers .
please !
that 's because i 've been on the wagon .
i do n't believe i 've seen you at any of our services before .
i come to the old lady 's funeral .
good evening , sir .
some people got no respect for the dead .
who 's going to raid a funeral ?
better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided .
sorry , sir . that 's reserved for members of the immediate family .
have n't you got another pew - not so close to the band ? how about that one ?
make is scotch . a demitasse . with a little soda on the side .
scotch coffee , canadian coffee , sour-mash coffee ...
coffee ?
sorry , sir , we only serve coffee .
booze .
what 'll it be , sir ?
you boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses ?
me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over chicago .
you and who else ?
quit kidding . you did that vulcanizing job on toothpick charlie - and we know it .
i sleep with my spats on .
you shave with your spats on ?
i cut myself shaving .
because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them .
why ?
ever hear of the deluxe french cleaners on wabash avenue ?
clark street ? never heard of it .
where did they play it - in a garage on clark street ?
that 's an opera , you ignoramus .
what 's his first name ? and where does he live ?
me ? i was at rigoletto .
say , maestro - where were you at three o'clock on st. valentine 's day ?
big joke !
i heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so i thought i better be around in case anybody decides to sing .
hello , copper . what brings you down to florida ?
well , spats colombo - if i were saw one .
these are my lawyers - all harvard men .
if you want to , you can call your lawyer .
you 're wasting the taxpayers ' money .
toothpick charlie ? never heard of him .
from who ? toothpick charlie , maybe ?
we got different information .
mozarella ? never heard of him .
come on , spats - we know you own this joint . mozarella is just fronting for you .
me ? i 'm just a customer here .
embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof .
big joke . who 's the rap this time ?
you 'll like it there . i 'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped !
i never join nothin ' .
a little country club we run for retired bootleggers . i 'm gon na put your name up for membership .
go where ?
okay , spats - the services are over . lets go .
goodbye , charlie .
look , chief - i better blow now , because if spats colombo sees me , it 's goodbye charlie .
okay , charlie .
if you want a ringside table , tell 'em you 're one of the pall bearers .
thanks , charlie .
i come to grandma 's funeral . here 's your admission card .
that 's very refreshing . now what 's the password ?
spats colombo .
refresh my memory .
i already told you .
and who runs it ?
yes , sir .
all right , charlie - this the joint ?
orders from little bonaparte .
what for ?
yeah . you never know who 's going to be next . okay , spats . report to the sergeant- at-arms .
well , we all got to go sometime .
we thought you was all broken up about toothpick charlie .
why would n't i ?
hi , spats . we was laying eight to one you would n't show .
no , spats - no , no , no - no !
too bad , charlie . you would have had three eights . goodbye , charlie !
honest , spats . i had nothing to do with it .
so now i got all those coffins on my hands - and i hate to see them go to waste .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
oh , i would n't say that . you were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends ...
you do n't owe me no nothing .
just dropped in to pay my respects .
what is it , spats ? what do you want here ?
hello , charlie . long time no see .
yeah . most important day of my life . whatever . listen , i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons : i love you , youre my favorite , and only , half-sister , blah blah blah . but the main reason i picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years , i knew you wouldnt outshine me . but here it is , my big day . my big day . and something doesnt feel right . maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night , i dont know , but your misery just isnt working for me anymore .
wow . you look beautiful .
sure , disappear . weve been walking away our whole lives .
you know what ? im not having this conversation right now .
hey .
hey .
you practically bribed him with your erector set .
so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat . he wanted to play with me .
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day , tony walked me home from school . he was my first boyfriend . i was fourteen .
im fine . i promise .
are you sure youre okay ?
i should get going .
what ? why ? what do you mean ?
god , kat ! please . dont be nice to me . i can take anything right now but you being nice to me .
but i do . i will . youre my sister .
when i freaked out at the pub ? that was nothing , just nerves . dont worry about it .
do you want to come in for a minute ? we could talk about --
the wedding . i am so , so bad ! i dont think i should be allowed to get married .
pub golf ?
i dont think i can go through with this .
bacardi 151 .
why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole ?
drunk isnt the same thing as happy , amy .
oh , shut up and be happy . its always this or that . youre never happy , you frowny-faced grumplestilskin .
christ , amy .
did amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed ?
did kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath ?
but im not taking your name , buster . im a feminist ! i need icey ! mr. husband-man , get me more icey !
except its scotch .
perfect . all ginny .
exactly ! todays my day . tomorrow will be my day . and the day after that ? my day .
theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you ?
you know what i love about all this ?
and she wonders why i swim to the bottom of a lemondrop every time i see her .
or kat ... .
if ed ever found out ... .
still --
it was such a long time ago .
actually , i do .
you know all that if these walls could talk stuff ? do you believe it ? that a place has a memory ?
to make sure youre okay .
what for ?
sorry to interrupt . your dad sent me .
its not me . i swear . its her . shes magic .
fred astaire and whats her face !
last night ?
jeffrey told her last night .
does kat know ?
i knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together . i never in a million years would have dreamt it was jeffrey .
say something . please .
your probably best off pretending youre asleep .
whatever you do , dont mention italy . or politics . or baby buggies . or edith piaf .
youd better get going . my parents will be round to cart you off to the country .
so she flirted with tony , and you got mad and sent him away . who did that leave ? you and amy . reunited .
she did ?
anyway , when that boy came over , it was the first time you ever did anything without her . and amy wasnt just jealous ... she was sad and lonely . she missed you .
mom , please .
before tony , you and your sister were best friends . i couldnt split you up . if your sister ate the spinach , you ate the spinach . if you threw up -- .
trust me . this is bigger than tony pee-pants .
theres a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story , you know .
i was pretty hard on her last night . and now shes getting married .
whats going on with you two ?
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door , i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches .
im an american and in america , people sue . so to prevent a lawsuit , i baked a tart . and i dont bake .
it was just after we moved here . my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they havent made up since .
she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything . the fall of the british empire , the cold war , the internet .
why should this be any different ? besides , i have to initiate nick into the family .
oh , no . she tells this story at every major holiday .
i blame tony pee-pants !
oh , dont be that way .
id be happy to . youre welcome .
sir , yes , sir !
im sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces . oh , and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcher-wootens .
moms refining her strategy for dday .
im not as square as my daughter thinks .
huh ?
my mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture . she thinks its --
why , with you .
wheres nick sleeping ?
yeah .
i figured you could pick up your car tomorrow .
you heading to the train station ?
yeah , kind of .
i look like a total wanker , dont i ?
dont be ridiculous . its late and the place is empty . just take my car .
ill just check into a hotel .
fair enough , but im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like ...
i had to say something to get you here .
i thought you said you were crap .
im a hooker .
i think i love you , mate . how do you know so much about so much ?
its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute , need a prostitute . you did the right thing .
just because some slags been paid for , doesnt mean youve got to ... you know .
you are taking the piss ?
um , just about everyone .
whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding , honestly ?
doesnt look like nothing .
nothing .
and you do now ?
i didnt deserve her back then .
lasik surgeon , actually .
oh , shut up . youre an optician .
thats when i realized i wanted to be a doctor .
but , somehow , it was kats arse that was stung by nettles . and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf .
and kat was fully clothed .
oh , yes . right . the rat and parrot .
it was before you started going out . we had lunch at that inn on the lake .
no .
remember when we went hiking in the lake district and amy was wearing that little bikini thing .
no , thats not it .
other than , hes shagging your exgirlfriend ?
theres something about him thats just a bit odd .
what ?
whats his problem ?
no , i cant . were late for a dance lesson . i guess youll have to finish up later .
sorry , can you give us a moment ?
hey , man .
you yanks and your therapy . its great . its all a bit too touchy-feely for me .
no , tell me .
nothing , nothing .
what ?
crikey .
shrink , actually .
ah , a philosopher .
oh , hello .
hey .
i shagged amy . two years ago . thats why i ended it . and then , after you left , sod it , we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad . and , you know , morally wrong . then there was that one other time . and that was it .
im sorry ?
i slept with your sister .
its the past . its nothing but ghosts . so just get it off your chest , then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu .
well , it was a big deal . as late as ... yesterday . or this morning . but not anymore .
brilliant .
relax . take a breath and just say it . its no big deal . i promise .
bollocks , im sorry . i had no idea this would be so difficult .
when we were together i was too here , now im not here enough .
youre not even listening .
its not supposed to be anything , kat . its just my rather feeble attempt to ... . oh , i dont know . you see , i thought i could deny my feelings --
is this supposed to be an apology ?
well , we had a lot of good years , but then ...
not for a dog .
right . seven . christ , thats a long time , isnt it ?
seven if you count the on-and-off years . which i do .
you were so good to me . i swear i never meant to hurt you . we were together what , five years ?
i should have told you why i broke up with you . i was a coward . you deserve to know .
so , whats your point ?
it was . and it took your sister getting married to get you back here .
that was a long time ago .
kat , stop it . you do . you cant even look me in the eye . you went back to the states when we split up .
um , news flash : i dont give a shit .
kat , wait . i dont want you hating me . weve never had this talk . you know how crap i am at this .
is that why you brought him ? because of me .
its called character . god , youre predictable .
kat , we must talk . this guy , theres something not quite right .
whoa , jeffrey . slow down . you and me , were the past . im not sure if you noticed , but im here with someone else .
i have regrets .
so , tell me , hows unmarried life ?
maybe not her least ... theres always --
let me guess . amy presumed id forget the rings . i think im her least favorite person . you know , i am sorry .
hey , you !
hey , yourself . i see youve met my ex .
hey , kat .
yeah ?
seeing you again ... .
hello , katmandu .
why , jeffrey . hello .
thank you .
nice speech . i thought it was touching ... and funny .
i have to . im the best man .
what ? ! no , no . you cant --
i should go .
hi .
hi .
go ahead , kat . hate me . you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing . maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship .
youre right . i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie . and after all that ? the only one who ended up falling for it was me .
youre judging me ? ! oh , thats a good one . youre lying to me , youre lying to your family , and youre lying to yourself . but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me ? the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend ?
you let me make a fool of myself ! you lied to me ! i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do . its your job . its who you are . how would you even know if something were real ?
yeah ! for all i know , come monday morning , well go back to the real world and ... and youll be hiring me for your best friend !
youve always got that to hide behind , dont you ? its just business !
besides , you hired me for my discretion .
so whats with the nickname ?
he bled a bunch , but no , there was no peeing .
and thats when he peed in his pants ? after the tart ?
i didnt say he was worth it .
fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set ?
yeah .
yeah . you ?
spontaneously combust ?
what would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think ?
make out with you for free .
what would you do if you were n't an escort ?
desperation ?
there was something in your voice on the phone that day .
so , whyd you say yes to me ?
when i said id never done a wedding before , i didnt say that no one ever asked . i just never said yes .
sure , but its never easy . they say theyre okay with it , and they are ... for a while . then one day , theyre not .
you have had girlfriends ?
its my job .
im sorry i was such a bitch . i really appreciate your doing this .
you paid me for a lot of reasons . closure wasnt one of them .
he was about to un-stick me ! i paid you to help me get closure .
i just hate seeing you so stuck .
oh , cut the crap !
hello , goodbye , i want you , i hate you . its all just words . none of it means anything . what matters is what you do . you either stay put or you walk away . if you look back , youre not walking away !
yup . thats why you get to keep your money .
but nothing did .
believe me , if anything had happened , that would have been one of the highlights . for you .
what ?
no , no . the three hundred is for you doing it to me .
and what if i didnt want you to ... to do that to me ?
not dollars . pounds .
so youre telling me . if something had happened last night ... it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars ? thats a down payment on a ford focus !
not if you take an advance on your credit card .
dont they have a limit at those machines ?
if i was going to charge you , i would have told you beforehand . i thought i explained that .
of course not . how ... how could it be ? nothing happened .
is this for last night ?
we kissed . made out a little . then you passed out .
are you sure ?
ive got this bad taste in my mouth . what is it ? i think its the words : morally repugnant .
come on .
show me .
its hard to explain .
i disappear . its not about me .
subtle ?
oh , come on . youre like the yoda of escorts .
i swear . i dont have a signature move .
okay .
dont stop asking questions , okay ?
this is awkward for me . talking about it makes me feel better .
i love that youre asking questions , but do you really want to get into all of this ?
my sixth-grade science project was entitled , love hurts : the heartbreak of human papillomavirus . trust me , im careful .
theres a guy on 81st and madison . you get your results in 24 hours . do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them ?
what do you think ?
i guess so .
are you asking me if im gay for pay ?
when youre ready to let go , to be unsingle and unmiserable , you will . until then ... .
what ? !
yes .
first of all , its never out of the blue . and second of all --
so ... what was i ... oh , yeah . do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable ? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart .
admit it . you were disturbed , but ultimately moved .
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries ?
i have a different story for every woman who asks . i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me .
you shit !
yeah . as an adult , i needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex , but with rules that couldnt be violated .
oh , no .
the real story is that my mother was a hippie . and a stripper . she was insanely inappropriate with me . she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater . while i was still in the bath .
shampoo , got it !
would you grab my shampoo ?
if it makes you feel any better , to get your number , i had to cough up two round-trip tickets to amsterdam and a case of mini-baileys .
your friend guaranteed my anonymity .
i have a friend at the magazine .
how did you know that was me ?
well , happen , in the sense that i picked up the phone , tracked you down , flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401k .
this happened to you ?
sorry . im a little nervous . i never thought something like this would happen to me .
thats right . imagine facing it alone .
not you . youre not disgusting . youre lovely . just the idea that theyd bring an escort . i mean , a stranger who , um , didnt ... who never ... . i mean , someones dead .
i think thats disgusting .
not the way youre thinking . the women wanted me there for support . you can understand that .
a wedding .
a weekend ?
have you ever done anything like this before ?
i do ?
you stand on your tiptoes .
what is ?
its cute .
what ?
graham russell and russell hitchcock .
who are they ?
im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality . except for approval . that , i cant get enough of .
you quitting ?
its okay . hell , ive never paid for it . but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me .
that wont be an issue , believe me . i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant . no offense .
great , with the occasional stabs of shame . now , listen , this covers the weekend , but as we discussed , if you want to be intimate , we talk money before anything happens .
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you ?
on the nose . i tell you what , because youre so cute , ill take care of our incidentals .
six thousand , right ?
im compulsive and weird ?
why ?
no , count it , anyway .
youre too good for him .
what does your gut say ?
i dont know .
what did he say exactly ? i mean , you dont think he wants me back ?
of course he is . im here with my new man . i love it ! your magics already working . let the suffering begin .
he was pretty drunk , but i think hes still crazy about you .
jeffrey knows love like he knows macram .
love .
well , he looks miserable . what were you talking about ?
oh , yeah . so we split it . you know , as in share . people do that .
the knicks game ? we both wanted the last hot dog ?
i dont do naked . my sister ? she does naked .
you know , they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked .
both .
mmm , nice dress ? or mmm -- gorgeous , i was insane to let you go !
mmm .
really ? dont get too attached .
mission accomplished .
yeah , but i feel like crap . and if you feel like crap , its way better to look hot while youre doing it .
youre funny .
dont patronize me . theyve clearly been at this a while .
you have feet ?
what color are my shoes ?
exactly . i want us to look like we fit , but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit . its welcome cocktails , not prom . with this level of matchy-matchy , we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere .
you think we look like were trying too hard .
kat .
hi . hey .
im so sorry .
you knew ?
oh , no . he told you .
dad made me go over and apologize the next day .
like fifteen .
therapist .
whats he do anyway ?
i wasnt saving you from him . i was saving you from yourself .
you didnt have to do that .
sure . youve got to play them against each other . otherwise they think youre easy .
you have more than one gynecologist ?
kat ellis ! we live two hundred miles away from each other but i have to fly all the way to london to see you . you havent visited me once in d.c. where the hell have you been ? i have gynecologists that call more often .
of course , dont be silly .
you want me to let him in ?
yes ? no . what ? save the patter for the tourists .
you want i nut him in the boat ?
not exactly . i wear it . on my right hand . and only rarely .
you pawned it .
give it back ? are you nuts ?
the one i made for you is the cherries . you hang onto it or give it back ?
i get all the glamour jobs .
i heard you were back in town , kitty cat . youre here for the highland flings , i bet .
hey , sal .
then for once in your life , do something for yourself .
yeah .
oh , well , then . it probably wont work out .
its complicated , dad .
so whyd you let him go ?
ahoy !
thats not true . we checked for leaks a few years back . good morning .
meet nick .
hi , kiddo .
dad !
hard .
shes drunk . -er than me . but i didnt really dump you , did i ?
i havent thought about that in years .
i always wondered what happened with us .
close . sydney . turns out , i missed the rain .
i thought you were living in san francisco . or was it nepal ?
... but its getting there .
not yet ...
just drunk enough .
im worried . amys not good at drinking . she gets sooo drunk sooo fast . does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker ? is it drunker or drunker-er ?
will do .
hey , sigmund , you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party ?
-- and the ass of the man who adores her .
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass --
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them .
what do you say to that ?
what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource : your daughter .
what is it you do again ?
at least somebodys using the damn thing . i was gon na fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much , we never launched her again .
i am now , sir .
is there any other way to take it ?
im guessing maccallum , 18 years . neat , with a water-back .
means you keep me using my head , and that 's good !
what do that mean ?
whewwww ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !
yes , mam ...
and so you did your job , right ?
nothin ' ...
i ca n't answer that for you -- but it 's no fault of your own that you do n't know where your father is now . you tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father . come on , tell me ...
but where is my daddy ! ?
but you did all you could , david . not many little boys could 've gone on such a journey as you did .
what do i tell my mama when i get home ? i did n't find him and that 's what i wanted to do .
well , you should n't worry about him too much , david .
yes mam ...
you think about your father a lot , do n't you ?
my daddy likes to look into the dark , even when there ai n't nothin to see -- it 's what you hear he say .
what are you looking at , out there ? there 's nothing to see .
not now , david , it 's time for bed . you have a long trip ahead of you in the morning ...
i been like that myself , when i thought nobody was gon na believe me ... you wan na hear another story ? !
you could ? how ?
he was real scared nobody would believe him -- i could tell , even when he first stood up .
you know , that was a good thing you did for clarence , in class today . i believed his story , but i was afraid the other children would n't ...
oh ... . you right , that 's all that was worryin ' me right then ...
because all you could think of was getting away from the guard .
... so me and sounder , ran right by the men that was the prisoners , and crawled under the fence ! that 's when i cut my hand on the glass . it hurt like mad ! but i kept runnin ' , and then i did n't feel no more hurtin ' till i stopped runnin ' ! why was that , miss johnson ?
it was the best thing i ever been to , miss johnson !
well , how did you like the class , david ?
i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father 's name is nathan lee morgan , and ...
now do n't you think it 's time you told me all about yourself ?
he 'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed .
what about sounder ?
and you 're a tired little boy . i 'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep .
you 're a friendly lady , miss johnson .
why do n't you sit and i 'll read you something he said .
what he talk 'bout ?
dr. william e. b. dubois .
what 's his name ?
here 's one by a man that 's very much alive .
sure --
do n't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ai n't dead ?
colored .
and the other people you told me 'bout , they is all colored folk ?
that 's where we came from first .
that 's where we come from first ?
here it is , right here .
where is africa , miss johnson ?
they lived a long time ago -- before you and i were born .
that 's right --
and you say all them people is dead now ?
i try ...
you got a pretty house , miss johnson !
i do n't live far from here . you and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we 'll talk about how to get you back home .
thank you , miss johnson .
that does it ...
uh huh ...
did your mother know you were going to see your father ?
me and sounder went to this prison camp to see my daddy and the police guard runs us away and i fell on some glass .
it 's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this ?
sometime , but not like this .
you keep looking around , david . do n't you go to school ?
let me see it ...
david lee morgan . my dog 's name is sounder . that feels better .
my name is camille -- camille johnson and i 'm the supervisor of this school . what 's your name ?

you do n't live around here , do you ?
i just wanta wash my hand . it 's got blood where i hurt it .
yes mam ...
can you swim ?
no , miss johnson ...
clarence , would you tell us a story that was not true , after telling us it was ?
she was dirty and wet ...
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water ?
me and my little sister , went down to the water hole , last saturday --
go on ...
yes , miss johnson ...
you know that the class is going to challenge your story , do n't you , clarence ?
: his mother , with her head thrown back , her eyes aglitter and laughing .
: ... finer spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black .
: his visit with his father at the county jail house --
: ... the chance to soar in the dim blue air above smoke is to their ...
: he , josie and earl , running and playing in the field .
: ... hearts . and to themselves in these days that try their souls ...
: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
: -- the strange endings of nature they have seen , may give the world new points of view and make their loving , living , and doing precious to all human ...
you getting the point , mrs. boatwright .
you would do that , would n't you ?
do n't tell me about what 's wrong . you come into my office as a friend and steal city files ! i could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody , that 's exactly what i 'm going to do -- and i 'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for ! you wo n't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy !
charlie , you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is ! you hear that , you and this whole damn court house ; what you are doing is wrong !
no buts , rita !
i did look , charlie , but i --
i see you found what you was lookin ' for .

but , charlie --
now look , rita , i do n't make the rules -- you puttin ' yourself on a limb , comin ' here , askin ' me to do a thing like this . and i be damn if i 'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy !
charlie , just because a man and his family are colored , you --
i ca n't do it , rita -- that 's the policy here on colored prisoners , and i ai n't about to change it , not even for a friend like you .
i 'm gon ' miss this ol ' raggedy place .
what 's that , son ?

daddy , when is we goin ' huntin ' ?
great , son -- not like wakin ' up in jail . for a minute or two , did n't quite know where i was , but when i saw your face lookin down on me , made me know right away the day was gon na be a good one , and it all belonged to me !

goodnight , daddy ...
i cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone ...
you bet we is !
we goin ' huntin ' again , daddy ! ?
and me too , son ! you shore done got to be such a big little man !
the rains started to come , and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up , and tell us when to move -- but we did n't mind the rain comin ' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there , watchin ' the guards and they weapons get wet , and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute . i was laughin ' all over inside -- a minute , that 's all , but what a minute it was !
what happened afta that ?
into the clouds and behind the mountains .
where did the sun go to , daddy ?
that musta been afta they sent me to this place call clayburn . that was the hardest workin ' camp they sent me to . the work was so hard , you had to look for somethin ' to laugh about to keep from feelin ' the whole pain in your body . like one time , it was in the middle of the day , and there were n't no sun -- you hear that ?
where was you , daddy ?
son , that was some trip you went on ...
got it hurt in a dynamite blast , son . the dirty dogs had no more use for me , so they let me have time off my sentence , and let me come home .
what 's wrong with your leg , daddy ?
just do like i tell you -- i 'll get word to you through the visitin ' preacher .
why , daddy ; you wo n't be here ?
i do n't know , son -- they wo n't tell us things like that -- but i do n't want y'all to come here no more .
can you say what camp they gon ' send you to , daddy ?
i think so ...
it 's a shame they wo n't let 'em come in here . if i had the strength i 'd knock down these damn walls -- if i could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us , son ?
naww -- he 'll come back to you , soon as his wounds heal . this cake shore is tasty , son .
do you think he 's dead , daddy ?
he 'll show up one day .
we did n't find sounder yet .
they is ! ? it shore is good to see you , boy !
mama is outside with josie mae and earl .
hi to you , son ...
hi , daddy ...
well , looka here ...
now who says i did n't lay my mark on you , boy !
`` you lose some of the time , what you always go afta , but you lose all the time what you do n't go afta ! ''
yep . i guess you must wonder why though , what with the luck we havin ' , but like i always say --
we goin ' huntin ' again tomorrow ?
when the fall comes in these parts , the night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin ' all night , and not see a thing out yonder .
yes , sir ...
readin ' must be somethin ' powerful , huh , son ?
yes , sir -- i learn to write a little bit , and i can read a lot --
you learnin ' anything at that school ?

you had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow .

yes , sir ...
yeah . we better git back to house now .
it was too dark , daddy .
if anybody 's to blame , it 's me -- i oughta nailed him when i took that shot .
here , put my jacket over you .
it 's cold , daddy !
looks that way , son . guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there 's one left out here -- we got ta find him .
there ai n't no possums in this woods tonight , daddy .
never heard of 'im . we got ta lotta men here ...
do you know my daddy , nathan lee morgan ?
sunday ...
when 's that ?
got ta wait 'til visitin ' days .
mister , can you visit anybody here ?
nathan lee morgan ...
what 's your daddy 's name ?
yes , ma'am ... ?
david !
see you tomorrow , miss boatwright .
will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to ?
yes , david ...
miss boatwright --
my father taught me ...
david , you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden .
thank you , josie mae .
naw , i 'm carryin ' it !
why do n't you try and git you a new dog ?
i guess i 'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be .
act like one !
i do n't look like no possum !
he will ... come on , git down and act like a possum .
then why do n't he holler like he usta ?
he eats all right -- his throat ai n't scarred .
sausage and hambones !
what 's in there , david ! ?
yes , ma 'm ...
be good and be smart , little boy .
he ca n't get up , mama !
what 's wrong , nathan ?
he wo n't go mad -- he 's just lookin ' for a cooler spot .
it 's when the heat is so bad , dogs go crazy .
it 's the heat .
what 's wrong with him , david ?
but who 's gon na help me here with the house and in the field ?
she says i can come live with her while school goin ' on , and come back home every time there ai n't no school .
how can you do that ? you do n't live anywhere near that school .
she is , mama ... when the fall comes , she wants me to come to her school .
miss johnson must be a real kindly lady .
so when i left , she gave me these books .
miss johnson is a teacher , and ...
who 's miss johnson ?
some books miss johnson gave me .
what 's that you carryin ' ?
i guess they musta sent 'im to another camp .
did n't see 'im , mama . the other men there say they did n't know daddy .
did you find your father ?
i cut it on some glass and we got lost , mama .
ask your daddy to give you some word about when he 'll be comin ' home -- and tell 'im we love him .
yes , mam ...
here 's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest , go into a church or railroad station -- but do n't go into nobody 's house , you hear me ?
i got to , mama . i know daddy wants to see him .
i wish you would n't take the dog with you , david -- he 's likely to be a burden to you .
good night ...
good night , mama ...
yes , son . you better get back to bed .
can i go day after tomorrow ?
no , i do n't and i ought n't not to after the way you 've taken over since they took him away -- and i would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im . the field 's all planted , so i guess i can spare you for a little while . when do you wanta leave ?
mama , do n't i always do what you say -- every time i go to the fields to plant the corn , to miss boatwright 's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and i do it , and you do n't worry .
but you 'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes , where will you sleep ? i ca n't send you away from here like that !
i can do it , mama -- you know that . in the bible stories you read to us , everybody 's always goin ' on a long journey . jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he do n't even know where he lives , but he finds him . everybody finds what they supposed to find .
so did i. i figured when the time got right , we could all take a day or two and walk up there , but it 's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone .
no , ma'am ... mama , i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is , so me and sounder can go see him .
ca n't sleep ?
good ! but you do n't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it ! you 'll get that woman in trouble !
mama ! mama ! miss boatwright , say she gon ' help me find where daddy is !
he 'll be all right , mama . i 'll make him all right .
poor creature ...
listen , mama ...
what is it , david lee ?
i think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot . i do n't think he 's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself .
no mam -- i looked all over .
any sign of sounder ?
you sure can , son ...
can i go when the holiday comes ?
no , son . we havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway , they wo n't let womenfolk see their men no time .
did you see daddy ?
'bye , son -- i wo n't be gone long .
'bye , mama ...
david , come back here !
do n't take my daddy ! please do n't take my daddy !
children , come here ...
who is they ?
same as we -- they pray .
what do they do in the white churches , mama ?
nobody yet -- it 's all tied up .
who 's winning , mama ?
when you get outta that school , you come right on back home , y'all gon ' have to take this laundry work i done for miss boatwright today .
yes mam ...
you got two shirts on ?
tuck that shirt in , david lee .
ready to go , mama !
where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school .
where did it come from , mama ?
that 's right !
mama , there 's hot meat on the stove !
goodnight .
david lee , it 's time for you to get to bed !
hi , mrs. boatwright ... i 'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day , miss boatwright .
hello , david ...
i 'm used to it .
do n't pout now , david , it 's a long trip .
i 'll walk ...
come , i 'll take you home .
i do n't know a damn thing , now stop bothering me about it !
but , miss boatwright , you --
if i tell you i did n't , david , that 's what i mean .
but i saw you -- you looked in there , and you found out , miss boatwright .
no , he was wrong , david , i did n't find out .
you know where my father is , do n't you , miss boatwright ?
do n't mention this to anyone ! you hear me , david !
thank you , miss boatwright !
i 'll find out where your daddy is for you .
no , thank you -- i got ta go do some work in the field today .
would you like to have a cool drink , david ?
tell rebecca i said 'hi ' , now ...
yes mam ... we got ta go , miss boatwright.. .
when you read it we 'll talk about it ...
thank you , miss boatwright .
it 's about the three musketeers .
thank you , miss boatwright .
this is for your mama 's work , and here 's something for the three of you .
come in , children .
we brought your laundry , miss boatwright .
do n't belong to you ! it 's for the little important man , here !

i guess so -- but i went home and did me some praying to the lord . i said , lord , i went into this white church down in row and all i want you to tell me is how i ever got outta there in one piece .
they probly thought you was crazy .
you know , one time by mistake i went into a white church down in row county and to this day i do n't know how'n the devil i got outta that church alive .
and if they saw me pitch the way i did today -- they 'd hire me just to strike out babe ruth !
if they heard me sing like this up north i 'd be richer than the man i sharecrop for .
at the way you ask funny questions , josie mae !
mama , what was we laughin ' for ?
might be ...
is he gon ' be gone long ?
because he cared so damn much about you and me , child .
mama , why did they take daddy away ?
maybe soon --
mama , when kin me and earl go to school with david lee ?
do n't take all day at that table , david lee .
why do n't you pay him a visit , mr. howard ? he 'll tell you all about it .
somebody told me nathan was back . how is he ?

what did he want ?
well , let 's get to it , miss rebecca , 'cause i been waitin ' too long a time for your good cookin ' !
the most important thing is that you 're home ! we was gon na have cold eatin ' tonight , 'cause of the heat , but now , i 'm goin ' to cook !

`` found eight million pages with the word clitoris '' !
okay ...

okay ... i just need to find a few private message boards ...
i agree ! the only way to save our future is to unite and fight ! < b > something must be done ! we must take action fast ! my parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past ! < /b >
i do n't know . but it has gone far enough ! i 'm sick of it ! < b > something must be done ! change has got to come around ! they 're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground ! ca n't you see what this is leading to ? a world of chains and ties and glue ! we have to fight before they 've taken every one ! something must be done ! < /b >
what has the world come to ? this is horrible . we 're locked up , burning books , hating other people-
it 's only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too !

-or monkey fucker-
shiteater-
we 're going to find our boys ! for god 's sake sheila , you almost had them killed ! !
where are you going ? ! we need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals !
wake up , people ! we all have to do things that are n't pretty sometimes ! it 's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for ! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals ?
oh lord , what have we done ... ?
yes ! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut ! ! i am sorry young man , but i have had it up to here ! strap them in !
sheila , you 're going to far ! those are your children !
he was killed doing something he saw in the movie . it was terrance and phillip ... they killed kenny .
i knew this would happen ! those bastard canadians have now killed a child ! ca n't people see the damage that film is doing ? !
what is 'fisting ' ?
oh dear god ...
right away , ma'am !
i 'm needing lunch .
yes ?
and bill ?
yes ma'am !
well find out where that signal is coming from ! then hunt them down like dogs ! any and all canadian influence must be stopped at all cost !
ma'am , we 're tracking a resistance ... it 's probably canadian spies ! !
not necessary ? ! mr. president , may i remind you that our country 's heart and soul are at stake , and our children 's minds are the battlefield ! the bastard canadians want to fight us because we wo n't tolerate their potty mouths . well , if it is war they want ... then war they shall have ! ! !
oh , uh ... i do n't know if air strikes are necessary .
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers . it 's the only way to ensure that their smut ca n't reach american soil !
huh ?
what about air strikes ?
as commander in chief , i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack .
my fellow americans . i have led this fight in the war against profanity . i have founded mothers against canada . our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time .
oh god ... what have i done ...
silence ! ! ! now ! ! ! everyone bow down to me ! ! !
and i thought my mother was the master of guilt . geez louise .
yes ... and in doing so , you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming .
you have spilled the blood of the innocents . now the world belongs to me ... now begins two million years of darkness ! ! and all thanks to you ! ! !
oh .
silence ! i am satan !
oh no you do n't ! this is my fight ! ! i do n't need your help , alan dershwitz !
i am the dark master !
what the hell is going on ? !
you 're all part of satan 's army now !
you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school !
but i-
yes principal victoria . the pta is impeaching you .
article 42 ! you do n't mean- ? !
forgive me for saying so , principal victoria , but your methods are too ... shall we say ... soft ? as head of the pta , i am exercising my right under article 42 of the pta code .
ooh yes . i think we 'll have to give detention to those boys .
we must take action on this immediately .
well , it looks like i 'll have to send a warning letter out to parents . i have to put a stop to this before more children see 'terrance and phillip ' .
terrance and phillip are two very untalented , unfunny actors from canada . their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage . now it appears they have a movie and i 'm positive it 's not suitable for children !
what is terrance and phillip ?
terrance and phillip movie ? ! oy gevalt ! not again !
no , worse . here 's a short list of the things they 've been saying .
the f word ? !
no , it was worse than that ...
what did my son say , principal victoria ? did he say the s word ?
alright , i 'll make the call ...
i do n't care if it 's dangerous ! desperate times call for desperate measures , mr. mackey . perhaps i need to remind you of your situation .
mrs. brovlofski , the v-chip has n't been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .
then we 'll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization .
well , some of the children just do n't respond to 12 step programs .
what do you mean most , why not all ?
very encouraging . most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths .
how is the children 's progress ?
this is not a place for fun and games ! this is rehabilitation ! now get to it ! ! we at mac have a trial to go to !
uh , we 're just , starting our program ...
indeedy , that was a delicious choice of words !
you 're quite a purveyor of filth , little boy !
terrance ! no !
agh !
you did ? just now ?
did you hear that , terrance ? i farted !
canada is saving us ! !
what 's going on terrance ?
i know , terrance . i know .
phillip , this is worse than that trip to quebec city when i fell asleep in that disco .
i know , terrance . this is quite the shitstorm we 've found ourselves in this time .
oh , phillip . this can not be good .
you would know , dummy .
oh , you are such a maroon !
yeah , god , no wonder your country is so fucked up .
the problem is you do n't allow your children to think for themselves . you try to raise them in a protective bubble , and then when they finally get old enough , they realize they 've been lied to , and they resent you for it .
do n't believe the hype ! !
the young boy that died lit himself on fire . it was unfortunate , but how can they blame us ?
fight the power !
and you call yourself a canadian ! i told you we should of done leno !
this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us ! you are a bad man !
phillip , we 've been tricked and ambushed by the conan o'brian show ! !
cheers , terrance !
good one , phillip ! cheers .
hello , brooke shields !
hello , conan !
i sure did , phillip ! !
ha ha ha ! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart ! ha ha ha ! !
you bet , terrance !

well , terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience .
< b > shut your fucking face ! ! unclefucka ! ! ! you 're the one that fucked your uncle , unclefucka ! ! ! you do n't eat , or sleep or mow the lawn you just fuck your uncle all day long ! < /b >

anna ...

well get used to it , 'cause here we are , on the cruise of a lifetime .
i never though i 'd be stuck in a wine closet with warren wayne .
well is n't that great . something to write home about .
i think we 're moving .
yeah , well ... i forgot my morphine back in the room .
getting drunk is no solution .
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do .
will you two please stop it ! i do n't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch !
he 's shutting off the air ! ! !
oh my god , what is he doing ?
very professional of you .
no , i think hygiene is important . it helps you get into the part .
i 'm sure i will .
well , it was nice meeting you . enjoy the rest of the trip .
it certainly is .
well , so we are . sure is beautiful , huh ?
well i guess we 're neighbors for this trip .
so ...
of course , of course ...
well a little business too . in my upcoming project star trackers i play a ship 's captain , and i really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience . i feel it will add more credibility to my performance .
so , what brings you out here ? pleasure cruise ?
well i appreciate that .
magnificent , magnificent .
oh , thank you .
my grandfather . my god , i ca n't tell you what a fan i am of yours ! you were magnificent in deadly gamble .
koros , as in ... koros ? dimitri koros ?
anna koros . she sensually extends her hand , warren shakes it -
uh , yes i am . and you are ?
you 're warren wayne .
excuse me ?
it ca n't be .
evening .
and i intend to correct that at once . i 'll tell you something mac ...
there is a high level ... of passenger dissatisfaction .
i hear you mac and i appreciate it . frankly i do n't know what i 'd have done without you on this one .
i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .
my ... wings ...
mac , you really earned your wings this flight .
the device has stopped responding .
on channel 10 ?
well you did the right thing mac .
i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .
were you going to give it to them ?
they are awaiting further information .
and what are they doing now , mac ?
i did nothing to the monitors .
you did n't do anything to the monitors , did you mac ?
yes he did . yes he did . barnes looks at the monitor - taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
oh he did , did he ?
i was there . officer taylor accessed my cpu directly to open the airlock doors . they are not functioning properly .
were n't you down in the dining room ?
hello second mate barnes . i was instructed to come to the bridge .
where the hell did you come from ?
well shut it off at once !
all too well , captain .
look answer my question !
it 's a little late for you to be up .
what did you say to me ?
ai n't it the truth . must be good to be rich .
well , i guess she figures she 's paying for it .
why should she , it 's her fault . all guests are told not to eat in zero gravity , but she just wanted to have fun i guess , did n't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery .
good help is hard to find ...
idiot ...
look you said it does n't matter to you anyway ! why do you want to kill more innocent people ! why !
i told you not to try anything smart ! i guess you 're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order ! and that 's just too bad for all of you now , is n't it ?
look we gave you what you asked for . it checks out did n't it ? ! what more do you want from us !
sure you do . sending mac out on a little recon work . how pathetic . problem is it seems mac blew a few fuses . or maybe he 's just a little drunk . were you partying with a robot taylor ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about !
taylor , you surprise me .
mac , can you hear me ? come in ?
will you transmit the distress signal ?
that was a joke taylor , lighten up ! why do n't you just hold them up to the lens . i 'll write them down , and once i 'm through verifying them , i 'll get back to you .
well , preferably in tens and twenties ...
we have the codes here . how do you want to receive them ?
uh , that 's an affirmative , roger wilco . please proceed .
who said i 'll re-enter in the pod ? i got friends out in space , ryan , friends willing to get me back unnoticed . thank god for deregulation huh ?
it 's still not going to work ! they 'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel !
i 'd advise you to shut up and let me finish taylor . you need n't worry about the lifepods because they 're all gone , jettisoned . save for one .
then we 've got to get to the lifepods !
ok , i will . the bad news is the ship is history . life support will last another 36 hours , maybe .
you better start making sense !
now do you want the good news first or the bad news ?
yes i can transmit the code 3 emergency ! i just do n't think it 's a prudent move at this juncture .
what are you talking about ! can you transmit the code 3 -
much as i 'd like to help you and our valued guests , i 'm afraid i ca n't .
transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline . override the airlock sensors and hurry ! we 're running out of time , we have to get to the pods !
the bridge is fine , taylor , how are things down there ?
what is the condition of the bridge ?
why yes ryan , i am , and thanks for asking . you do n't have to talk to the intercom , i can hear you fine .
barnes , can you hear me , are you all right ?
that 's very professional sounding of you , taylor .
if anyone can hear me please respond !
yeah yeah yeah , give me a minute here .
bridge ! can anyone hear me ? !
i can hardly wait .
well , maybe i 'll surprise you .
no . i 'm all set . thanks .
well , maybe i will . you sure you do n't want anything ?
i think i can handle it .
uh ...
what , and leave you here all by your lonesome ?
nah , i already ate . why do n't you just go down there ?
man , i 'm hungry . i 'm going to call the steward , you want anything ? .
thank you .
that 's very pragmatic of you , barnes .
you got ta think of your old age .
it 's steady , good benefits .
you want to go back to shuttle work ?
well that hotel begins construction in january , there 's going to be a lot of shuttle work .
why , did n't they say ?
i do n't know . everything 's up in the air at this point , no pun intended .
so , are you on for the next one ?
ai n't it the truth . the two say nothing for a beat -
well , everything 's running smoother than a baby 's ass .
all right , i 'll give it a shot .
trust me . even checked 'em with my own eyes .
you 're certain of that ?
why do n't you reset and run it again . the pods check out ok .
yes i 'm sure i hit the right commands .
there must be some mistake . you sure you hit the right commands ?
it 's telling me fail mode confirmed . did you see this ?
well it 's a good thing that i did .
no , i just ran it ! why are you running it again ?
sounds like you 've been talking to mac too much .
well i guess there 's no time like the present . i 'll go run a check on that room , just to show we go that extra mile for our guests .
over and out !
sheesh ! aye aye cap'n !
good . now you 'll hear from me when i have the new coordinates . in the meantime do n't bug me .
that 's clear .
is that clear ?
this is a major screw up on your part , goddamn it !
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod ! you 're just gon na have to pick me up later .
let 's get something straight , chappy !
goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions !
i told you , i had to teach a few people a lesson !
well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation ?
do n't worry about me , i 'm changing coordinates now . i 've come to far to be tripped up by some dudley do-right ... motherfuckers !
well blaze your ass out of there ! you 've completely altered your trajectory , are we linking up or not ? !
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory !
the others decided to get cute with me , so i 'm teaching them a lesson !
you 're not helping my heart condition any , barnes ! now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for ?
damage control ! what kind of damage ? what 's going on barnes !
cool your jets ... i 'm doing a little damage control .
so , what are we waiting for ?
i know , i know .
it 's time we lock coordinates .
10-4 good buddy .
oh you 'll get it , believe me . so i 'll see you in a few .
well that 's your call . does n't make a damn bit of difference to me . just as long as i get my cut .
i do n't know . i really have n't made up my mind yet . we 'll see how nicely they behave .
will do . what about the distress signal ?
yeah , i know bill , i came up with the plan remember ? just have those hangar doors open and ready , i can take it from there .
well do n't drag your ass . there wo n't be much of a window for us to link up . we 'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours .
seems like they 're cooperating . hopefully i 'll be out of here and on my way very soon .
break it down to me , what 's going on ?
that 's me .
barnes ?
just do n't move around too much .
it 's getting hard to breathe ...
will you shut up already ?
we 're going to die .
do n't say that ! it ai n't over till it 's over !
what 's the use ... we 're gon na die ...
i do n't have a problem with it . besides , you get to meet a lot of interesting people .
well , more power to you . me , i start to bug out after too much time out here .
not me . i 'm in for the long haul . in nine months i 'll have enough to take a few years off .
well ... i do n't mind . i can put up with it . i 'm taking six months off after this , and i wo n't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me .
like that piece of ass he was with .
no . but it buys a lot of other things .
yeah , i guess money do n't buy class .
look at this ... jesus .
i do n't know . wave to them !
what is it ? !
try not to think about it .
right now it 's about 8 o'clock at home . people are going to work , kids are going to school ...
good . in that case , i pronounce us man and wife .
in that case , i accept .
it would matter to us .
i would , but no one can perform the ceremony . i guess it does n't matter .
that 's right . will you marry me ?
marry you ?
will you marry me ?
except write our wills .
it did . it is . there 's nothing we can do about that .
i never thought this would happen . no premonitions , nothing .
and so far .
so close ...
we do n't have time . i 'll explain later , hurry !
what do you mean ? what happened !
we have room ! let 's go !
what the hell are you doing ?
over and out .
sooner than later .
hopefully sooner than later .
thanks for everything , taylor . will i see you again ?
i 'm staying with the ship . i 'll be all right . now hurry .
so what 's going to happen to you ?
i 'll do my best .
uh , it 's ok , everything 's going to be ok ... now i 'm counting on you , and whatever you do keep calm , we do n't want them to panic .
how does the distress signal look ?
hurry . you have to get them out of there !
i 'm about to blow the wall .
he 's out of the equation . talk to me .
barnes ?
i 'm in the bridge .
taylor ! where are you ?
dawn . come in .
you too .
i will once i get past the bulkhead . good luck .
i ca n't !
but you ca n't be sure ! it 's suicide . you have to come with us !
do n't worry about me . there 's still a chance i can issue a distress signal .
but how are you going to escape ?
i 'm going to try and buy you some time . i can get to the bridge from here .
and what are you going to do ? !
there 's only room on that pod for seven . that 's you and the others . i 'm counting on you to get them out of there .
what ? what are you talking about ?
i 'm not going with you .
why ? where are you going ?
a little dab 'll do ya . now you know how to get there , right ?
no ...
a flare ? a flare wo n't do it .
take this flare .
that 's why we need a safe passage . remember what you said earlier , about getting through the wall ? that might just be our ticket .
we do n't have enough suits to get the others out .
a schematic of the ship . looking for a lifeline to the pods .
what 's that ?
the room is filled with poison gas . the hydraulic system must have blown .
oh my god . what happened ?
it was no time to lose my partner . we 're going to have to hurry , he 's on to us .
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude . you saved my life .
helllp !
dawn ! dawn !
words to live by .
do n't worry about what will happen , just concentrate on what is happening . you 'll live longer .
sure .
do you want some advice ?
yeah , but you did n't answer my question .
well , dawn , i 'm an optimist by nature .
what do you think 's going to happen to us ?
yeah ?
taylor ?
one of barnes ' duds , luckily for us . take this out of the equation right now ...
explosive ?
do n't worry about me . where are we going ?
be careful , you do n't want to puncture the suit .
at this point i 'm ready for anything .
you 're ready for the real thing ?
so we did .
yeah . we did it .
ready as i 'll ever be .
are you ready ?
i understand .
i do n't know what we 're facing .
simulated space walking .
look i know what i 'm doing . i have experience and training in space walking .
i ca n't let you do that .
wait .
everyone just stay put .
even if we do , it might be too late .
if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal .
yeah , let 's hope he can find a way through .
it must be oxygenated if we can hear him .
close every door behind you !
he certainly is polite .
you 're right .
we could send mac . if he can retrieve one suit , we could go back for the other .
suppose you did n't have to hold your breath ?
and suppose you could n't hold out ?
i do n't know the condition of the compartments . depending on damage , debris ... could be a fatal mistake .
why ca n't we ?
damn it . if only we could get to those suits ... dawn then thinks of something -
great .
sure . it complies with all standard construction codes .
seen one like it before ?
ok ... it 's open .
with what ? how am i going to interface with it ? i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me .
ca n't we access the mainframe to check the ship 's condition ?
it depends on the condition of the ship . if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry .
supposing we could get out of this room ? is there anything we could do to reach the bridge ?
just considering our options ... sir .
i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . besides , what could we use for tools ? a steak knife ? a corkscrew ?
well maybe we can do something like that .
probably come through the wall i suppose .
given a malfunction , how would a rescue team get you out if the doors wo n't open ?
fat chance of that . even if we had c4 and a laser torch these doors would n't budge . that son of a bitch ... that stupid son of a bitch .
well maybe there 's a way out of here .
we do n't .
i do n't know .
what are we going to do ?
still , i hope i behave on the moon . i 'll stick close to you .
really ?
actually i 've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute , mostly related to starship construction .
i 'm sure you 'll be all right .
well i hope i do n't do anything careless .
well i do n't think there 's a chance of that happening . it 's usually the moon walks . sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher .
like open an airlock by mistake ?
well , let me put it this way . most of the cost is due to safety reasons . most people are not familiar with space travel , so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless .
well , plus the money ai n't that bad . dawn so , tell me , do you think everyone gets their million dollars ' worth on this trip of a lifetime ?
so you were looking for a new challenge .
this is my second commercial flight . i used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast .
yes . theoretical discoveries aside , there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ?
ryan taylor , first mate . welcome aboard . first time in space ?
that 's right .
oh right , right you 're on that research grant .
that is one of my priorities .
yes mac , but the guests are requesting it . it will reduce the level of negative feedback .
well if you need anything , please feel free to ask me . just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room , and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar .
so i 've been told .
well , there 's no better to way to see the world , than with us .
no , just enjoying the view .
is there anything i can help you with ?
thank you .
congratulations on your ... recent award .
i 'm fine .
are you nuts ! it 's too risky !
i 'm going back for taylor !
he 's in the bathroom .
carlo !
he 's up on the bridge ! he 's going to be ok. now who 's missing ?
where 's taylor ?
there 's no time to explain . get everyone together ! we found a way to the pods !
what is happening around here ! ! !
how can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy ! i want to go home ! i want to be warm ! i want to get out of here !
baby , take it easy .
it 's getting too cold in here . i ca n't stand this anymore !
talk to him ... jesus ...
you 're delbert miles ! you have more clout than some whacked out pilot ! talk to him !
how am i supposed to know ?
well now what are we gon na do !
send it back if you do n't want it .
oh no ... i think there 's carrots in here ...
besides i ca n't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity . that should shore up that prick hank drexler .
i guess so .
look around you baby , we 're rubbing elbows with royalty , oil sheiks , this is class . you 'll be envied by everyone .
look you were the one who wanted to do something different , something to tell all your friends . any chump can go to nassau .
how is it going to be different from this ? go see some boring footprint under glass ?
ah hell we can always do that . listen believe me , once we get to the moon , your tone is going to change .
we should have gone to nassau . at least we could go swimming , lie on the beach .
homesick ? it 's only been two days !
i 'm homesick .
the engines !
what the hell is that ?
what makes you so sure ?
because , taylor would n't do that , that 's why .
i tell you , something 's not right here . how do we know they 're not going to use the pod for themselves ?
what are you going to do about it ?
again with the orders from you ! you got a napoleon complex chief , and i 'm getting sick of it !
i 'll tell you what you 're gon na do . you 're gon na stay put like taylor said .
i have n't quite made up my mind yet .
who are you calling a pig , rummy ?
you 're gon na give him those bank codes , you know why ? because i 'm telling you to , that 's why . i 'm not losing my life over some greedy pig .
well what would you know about it ? you do n't have anything to lose .
look . we 're talking about life and death here . i do n't know why we 're even having this conversation .
that 's affirmative .
is it safe for human transport ?
i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector .
how is it looking , mac ?
certainly . anything i can do to be of service .
ok mac ... i 'll talk to you on this . i want to find a way to get to the bridge , then i want you to come back .
i 'm sorry . the suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated , zero gravity atmosphere . i 'm afraid that 's off limits to all passengers .
mac , what about the suit compartments on this level ? can they be accessed ?
yes . you can enjoy some wonderful views from there .
but the corridor outside this door is open , correct ?
one moment please ... one moment please ...
now mac , can you tell me the status of this deck ?
i know but we 're in a bind .
alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer .
yeah but the ship 's mainframe does n't . i need you to tell it something .
that will not be necessary . you can simply speak to me . i understand most languages fluently .
i need you to actually do something for me . i need to access your cpu , directly .
right , i understand that ...
certainly . i have a full working knowledge of the ships operations .
yes i know all that . mac , i need you to help us out with a little technical problem .
certainly . if you need anything , please feel free to ask me . just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
mac , i have a favor to ask you . mac looks at taylor -
mac . what 's shaking ?
officer taylor , how are you this evening ?
just like junior did the last time ; lane six . all 's i know is it 's gon na be a closed coffin . my advice to you is to lay low . he puts on a pair of dark 7-eleven shades , flips up his collar and skulks away .
the pin machine ?
did you hear about that bowler who got smeared ? i saw them pull a body bag out of the alley . i heard he was kacked but good . they had to take apart the pin machine to get him out .
maybe i should have left the ball in the car .
my father used to say to me `` never ... '' no , hmmm . `` always ... '' no , no ... ah ! love and hate are blood relations .
yeah , but it did n't go so good . he was n't the man i thought he 'd be . theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup , but his hands are trembling , spilling some of the coffee .
find your bowler ?
99 years , 241 days , 15 hours , and 20 minutes of no bowling . alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down .
a bowler .
what kind of man ?
i 'm looking for a man .
i 'm from akron .
you 're not from around here , are you ?
i 'm an addict . i ca n't go through a day without the stuff . theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand .
no . i 'm from akron .
orange who ? not from 'round here , are ya ?
you have orange whips ?
can i get you something for the road ?
paradise , huh ? might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. theo turns to leave .
nope .
you a mini-golfer ?
it 's splitsville for you .
you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place . junior 's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .
after we id , we bury the body . case and casket closed .
i should 've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one .
sorry about your loss .
you said it would be unethical to help me . you call dwarf bowling ethical !
heh , heh , heh .
he 's my dad .
hey , cut it out sid , that tickles . i 'm serious ! you guys are related , right ?
look sid , a buzz burger . the faz 's favorite lunch . sid reaches for the plate . buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from sid .
i do n't know no buzz fazeli .
it belonged to my dad .
have n't seen a ball like that since '69 .
whoa , cool your maples . over the bridge , past the peter pan , last house on the dead end . theo releases sid 's hand . sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand .
where can i find buzz fazeli ?
see ya 'round faz .
nectar of the bowling gods , faz .
the faz sure took care a her . breeze makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger . sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him . sid and breeze approach the coffin . breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid .
i 'd buy it !
think he bought it ?
only problem is , you did n't put his lights out , you just got him mad . then he took it out on poor faz , god rest his soul . theo patches out .
she told us you went after junior to save your old man 's hide . you got some balls goin ' after that psycho .
kastle 's daughter 's been lookin ' for you .
did you know you were parked in the handicap space ?
nothing going on here , everybody stand back . let him through , ladies . ladies , please . as they start to move through the female throng , a little girl pops out in front of them , holding her ball .
bowling police , step back , give him room .
is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock ? junior looks from one man to the other , breathing heavily , his nostrils flaring .
hello mr. kastle . junior , long time . i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden !
wait ! that 's an aria !
how do you turn this thing off ?
right , eating at the core , eating it 's way out . it makes me sick !
- canker sore .
but not no more . now people take advantage . bowling ai n't what it used to be . there 's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
sure , sid .
gambling . and it was a safe place for kids , a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome , clean fun .
bowling was the most incorruptible sport . no megalomillionaires , no
no kiddin ' .
you know , elvis bowled .
it was a clearance .
you got an 8-track tape player on purpose , just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin ' opera .
you listen to the feelings , not the words .
how do you know , you do n't even speak latin ?
how could you hate opera , sid ? opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music !
i hate fuckin ' opera .
la da da dalala ...
bowling used to be so pure , so ... all- american . breeze sings along with caruso and pretends to conduct .
so buzz , let 's skedaddle . mr. kastle is waiting . as buzz gets up , theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs .
your pop said to put these on his tab . sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .
pinhead ! do n't just blurt it right out .
i remember , sid ! mr. kastle says he do n't like no sticky fingers in the till .
look , faz , mr. kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you ... what was that he said ... ?
are you guys bruddas ?
buzz , mr. kastle wants to talk to you .
we 're looking for buzz fazeli , seen him ?
hey , you still here ?
when you get a chance .
three whips . to go .
you afraid we 're gon na steal it ?
ah , come on , lem me see your ball .
lem me see your ball .
yeah , basement bingo .
what do you want with old man faz ?
fazeli ... i do n't know no buzz fazeli .
no , pinhead , he ai n't here to bowl .
hey , ai n't i seen you on the tour ?
oh , a professional man . what 'll you have ?
theo 's bowled on the tour .
you look like you 're something on the lanes .
sheila , meet ... uh ... i forget the name .
buzz burger , side of 'cues . you have n't introduced me to your fan .
some people will do anything for an autograph . theo enters the diner and walks over to buzz .
you do n't need coffee , mr. fazeli ; you need a vacation . sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear . buzz follows sheila 's gaze .
yeah , and make it extra muddy , i did n't sleep a zee last night . sheila fills a cup . buzz lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .
wish me luck .
i 'm sure you have buzz .
miles , i 've always been on the square with you .
simple math , buzz . two plus two does not equal three .
and look at that ; both partners go down together . kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor , stands up , and crushes it under his heel . he goes over and puts his arm around buzz .
a beautiful thing . and you know why buzz ? you know what we got ? buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt .
it 's a beautiful thing .
brainstorm , buzz . i admit , i thought it was a rotten idea , but i put up the scratch . and now we got a beautiful thing .
this scam we got going here was your
seven years .
we 've been partners a long time now , have n't we buzz ?
what 's on your mind , miles ?
see ya 'round maynard .
you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call . tell him your maynard 's boy . he 's expecting you , and he owes me . he 'll getcha back in like flynn . do n't say i never gave you nothing .
i did n't mean that stuff i said . i was trying to keep you out of this muddle . i 'm glad i did n't have my tubes tied . oh , and by the way , i made a call for you before i - uh - retired . buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen .
listen , if straight does n't work out , you come work for me . just make sure nobody 's following you . buzz 's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset , his halo bouncing in the breeze .
i 'm goin ' straight . no more short cuts . theo gets into the car . buzz leans in the open window .
thanks , kid . where are you goin ' now ?
i never saw you .
so , eh , you never saw me . right ?
you 're a scumbag .
bowling died for me years ago . besides , i 'm a living dead legend . i 'm a hero .
what about bowling ?
i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .
it could just as easily have been me in that box .
i am underground .
the whole world thinks you 're underground .
he says that to all his wives .
we ai n't married no more .
i could n't care less .
look , kid , gim me a break . i 'm an old man . i 'm runnin ' on a delrin aorta . i 'm finished - dead from my ankles up .
i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad . the moment passes . theo turns and climbs into his car . he looks up at buzz .
you never even took the shot . you could n't do it . theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner .
that 's right , buzz , and you know when i did it ? last match , last frame . all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten , the fazeli split .
not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television .
i did n't think so .
no ...
you got a better offer ?
he 'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life .
i got ta survive .
did that porcupine say he 'd get you back on the tour ?
i 'm getting to like it here .
theo , i want you to get out of this town .
you 're dead without the pro-tour , and you know it . get him away from me . sid and breeze punch theo in the face .
i do n't need the stinking pro-tour .
that 's a laugh . you 're all strung out . you 're a bowling junkie .
fuck you and fuck bowling .
i had a career . she wanted a little bowler of her own . sid and breeze leap into the fray , prying the two men apart . they wrestle theo against a wall , pressing his face into the tiles .
do n't say that about my mom !
what makes you so sure it was me ? she coulda had lotsa bowlers ! theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm . the two men struggle for the pin .
you wish !
i 'm your blood .
i 'm more of a bowler than you 'll ever be . i deal with my own shit . i ai n't asking anyone to bail me out .
you have no right to call yourself a bowler . buzz slaps theo in the face .
i do what i got ta do to survive .
it looks like dwarf bowling .
what 's it look like to you ?
what the fuck is this ?
maybe i could bowl in japan .
if the japanese are pansies , then pansies are my kind of people . sheila steps over to the booth with their food . the buzz burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball . buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner .
not for me . miniature golf 's for pansies .
it 's gon na be bigger than big . think europe . think asia . they do n't have room for real golf courses in japan .
the small ball .
it 's the next level , the next dimension ... ... the small ball .
putt-putt golf ?
kissed a lotta tadpoles . listen , i been thinking about your problem . i 'm not the guy to sponsor you . it would be unethical . but , there is something i could do for you . putt-putt golf .
watch out for that one . she 's got a great average , but she 's looking for a prince . and , believe me , she 's
theo ! this is sheila kastle , my partner 's daughter .
theo .
i could n't pay someone enough to try to kill me . sheila comes over to take their orders .
she thinks someone 's trying to kill you .
you should n't listen to her , she 's a nervous old nellie .
what are you doing over at the lanes that 's so dangerous , buzz ?
you know what a mixer ball is ? it 's like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . buzz grumpily waves at him to sit .
millie left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma .
i ai n't nobody 's father !
i got a right . you 're my father .
you 're a bullshit artist , that 's what you are . you got no right to be here ! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz .
you knew her . you married her in 1963 .
i do n't know no grace skinner .
i 'm your son . you 're a hard father to find .
who are you ? who sent you here ?
she 's my mom .
grace skinner . who 's grace skinner to you ?
grace skinner .
who gave it to you ?
it 's mine .
where 'd you get this ball ?
thanks .
orange whip , nectar of the bowling gods . thanks sweetie . millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip . theo takes the other glass .
my mom was there . she told me about it . the 'fazeli split . '
that game was before you was born .
ten thousand to one , but you pegged it . the toughest shot on the last frame .
yeah , against that prick vandemark .
remember the finals in akron in '59 ? you had a seven-ten split in the final frame .
i 've never had orange whips , i 'm from akron .
sure , around here , any fat old bald guy could be king . i 'm nothing . it would n't do any good for me to talk to the congress . hey , you thirsty ? you like orange whips ?
i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you 're the king .
what do you think i can do ?
i can appeal in five . i was hoping you could help me mr. fazeli .
100 years !
they suspended me for 100 years .
i got suspended when i was young , too . i was pretty cocky in my day .
do n't worry about the congress , they 're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies .
well , mr. fazeli , the bowling congress says i 'm a thorn in their side .
need some advice , huh .
i 'm not on the tour this year .
i know your face , you 're an up-and-comer . you bowl on the tour .
theo .
buzz fazeli .
you see what you did ? take your ball and get out .
my poor baby !
millie , please . i do n't have a son . i think you better leave now young man . buzz gestures towards the front door .
son ?
we should leave this town . i ca n't take this anymore . i 'm not gon na let him kill you in my house .
millie , i know what i 'm doing .
you 're in trouble , are n't you buzz ? you 're doing something dangerous in that alley .
bowlers do n't go around killing other bowlers . he 's only a fan , millie . i 'll give him some tips and an autograph and he 's outta here .
i looked in his car . he 's got pictures of you , clippings , maps .
he 's not the guy , millie . just whip the whips .
he 's the guy buzz .
clam it !
oh sure . let everyone in . from now on i leave the door wide open . let the parade begin !
i got ta go . love ya mom .
you sure you 're ok teddy ? you 're not bowling are you ?
mom , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late .
he 's dead , is n't he . buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born .
i found dad .
theodore ? where are you ? are you alright ?
hello , mom ?
hello ?
i 'll tell you one thing , you wo n't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose . stay away from his ass - and do n't play any of his fuckin ' knock-knock jokes .
uh ... over easy .
i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks , he breaks my arm , tries to kill me . i swear man , the guy thought i was a piata . if nobody else had n't a been there , he would n't have stopped . he woulda killed me . fuckin ' guy man , just snapped . how do you like your burger ?
how 's that ?
hey man , welcome to our parking lot . lem me give you some advice , if she asks you to dance , make sure her brother 's not around . somebody blew out junior 's pilot light , if you get my meaning .
theo . howzitgoin .
cool !
do n't tell me , john .
i do n't want to play .
you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila , so i 'm gon na play blue-face with you .
what did you do to buzz ?
he told me to play blue-face with buzz . i like games .
what did your dad tell you to do to buzz ? theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees . junior catches him , grabbing his ankles .
nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her .
no , junior , you should n't touch her .
you should n't touch her .
junior ! you 're supposed to say junior who ! i 'm going to have to hurt you . theo and junior circle one another .
who 's there ?
no . i say knock-knock ! you say who 's there . i say who 's there and then you say who who . you 're not playing right . knock-knock .
buzz fazeli .
who 's there !
who 's there ?
knock-knock .
it feels good to let it out , does n't it ? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father .
it depends .
you 're prone to violent outbursts , are n't you ?
i do n't like to talk about it .
j'you-and-your-friend do it yet ?
junior who ?
junior .
who 's there ?
come on sheila , knock-knock .
do you have to get your hooks into every guy i 'm interested in ?
it 's not so bad . when i 'm alone , it feels like someone else . sheila grabs the bottle from junior , opens it and pours some on her shish kebab . she leans over and whispers furiously to her father .
blueface ! blueface is my favorite .
i have someone for you to play blueface with junior .
someone wants to play with me ?
i have someone for you to play with junior .
you made me hurt him !
we 're having a party for you , boy . cake and shish-k-bob , just like you love . junior cringes away from the light .
needs lubrication . lubrication .
come on , junior . everyone 's waiting for you , son . the beam of light catches junior 's face . he is crouched inside the machine at lane six . jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy .
sheila !
junior 's a problem child . he has a thing about -
i want you two to pick up buzz and bring him to lane six . junior will take it from there .
no !
buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins . sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other .
if junior thinks you 're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister , he 's gon na tap dance on your spleen .
hey , enough fun and games . we have work to do . come on junior . kastle heads for his car . junior gets up and follows . the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands .
if i find out buzz is comin ' up short on dwarf bowling , it 's lights out for him and pink slips for you . sid and breeze look sideways at each other .
someone gon na get kacked , boss ?
it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .
weird , comes into alleys and does n't bowl .
he killed your stoolie embezzler father , and he 's gon na kill you next ! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd 's murmur increases . kastle turns and yells over his shoulder .
where 's junior ?
i think buzz is retiring soon . in fact , i think he 's retiring tonight . kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila .
you already have a partner mr. kastle . sheila walks over as the sleazeballs ' car pulls out of the driveway .
i like you , theo . you bowl with soul .
why would you help me ?
you need a sponsor ; i have influence . i could sponsor you .
how mr. kastle ?
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling . you got ambition like a ... like a ... blowtorch . you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht ! - shish kebabs . maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good . i think i could help you , theo .
i like the sport the way it is .
there 's a lot of competition for amusement out there . you got ta adapt to survive .
what ever happened to just bowling ?
rac . r-a-c. renovate , automate , computerize . that , my boy , is the future . one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling . her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin . kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike . the little girl jumps with joy .
he 's earned an early retirement . but enough about losers ; buzz fazeli is history . lets talk about your future . i wan na show you something .
what if he wants to get out ?
if it springs a leak , it 'll be because buzz is making waves .
nice set-up .
profits down there , philanthropy up here . besides , it beats the pants off bingo .
think of this business like a big aquarium . you got ta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top .
that 's right , did n't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament , champ ? now go take out your `` big four '' , darling . come on , we 're making her nervous .
that 's some pinfall . almost a 133 average . her ball 's flat , she needs to work on her spin control .
it 's nothing , just a slight business imbalance . how 's gloria 's thumb ?
what 's with the bad air between you two , mr. kastle ?
maybe i can help you . try a lighter ball , penelope - you 'll get hurt with that big ball , honey . i 've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit . you got fazeli blood running through you . your pop was a genuine talent in his day .
you might say i 'm at the top of their shit list .
i heard you 've been having a little trouble with the congress . theo pulls his eyes off sheila . kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers .
nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it . you do n't mind if i have a word with theo , do you bunny ? kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away .
you know who i am ?
so you 're buzz 's boy . i 've been expecting you . you hurt my feelings when you did n't come and see me sooner .
bowling `` center '' !
do n't go near the bowling alley .
you still got the touch junior .
fantastic ! what talent .
just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you , does n't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business ! i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that . sheila and kastle sit up .
leave him alone !
look who 's talking !
you 're using theo for your own deviant purposes !
she ran away to be with that ... that motocross champion .
that 's why mom ran away , because you had to control everything !
you 're just like you mother ! always jealous !
he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid . crushed all the nerve endings . junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand .
after we eat , dad .
see ! no feeling . tell theo what happened to your hand , junior .
i bet you did n't know that you and junior have something in common , theo : junior ca n't bowl anymore either . is n't that right junior ? kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on junior 's right hand . the table settings jump from the shock . junior sits impassively , his face a blank .
ssssh ! now real quiet . on three . one ... two ... three !
dad , this is ridiculous . just open it .
four or five years when a girl like that 's bowling on the pro tour for team kastle , she 'll pay a handsome profit on my investment .
she hit it , mr. kastle !
i get them while they 're young . builds loyalty .
you keep that up carmelita and one day you 'll be a champion just like mr. skinner here . what do you think , theo ? think carmelita 's got the stuff ?
132 , 154 .
hello , violet . how 's my favorite 'bowlerina ' doing ?
hello , mr.kastle .
yippy !
hole in one ! you 're the queen of stroke !
strokin ' . here goes nothin ' .
no , no , that 's too far . try a more gentle stroke . it 's all in the stroke . go ahead , now , honey - stroke . as the camera comes around the side of the whale , we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman . his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it .
like this ?
now swing it out a little to the right ...
yeah .
line up where you want it .
grasp firmly . then what ?
that 's right , sugar , find the grip that 's right for you . then grasp firmly . the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green .
i just hold it loosely with both hands ?
the peter pan .
where can i find him ?
careful with that one . he wo n't tell me anything , but i know there 's something strange going on over at the lanes . if you ask me , i 'd say the old fart wants to die .
he 's no father to you .
he 's my father , millie .
buzz fazeli never helps anybody but himself .
i could n't kill buzz . i need his help . theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car .
this is a sign ! someone 's coming to take buzz away from me . i do n't know if you 're the guy or what , but i 'm not letting it happen . i 'm leaving him first .
i 'm sorry about zeus , millie .
he 's not here .
they suspended me .
get that outta your mouth !
i 'm sick of you people . why do n't you leave him be ?
i 'm a bowler .
who wants to know ? zeus !
is mr. fazeli in please ?
can you change something this big ?
you bet . for five bucks , i 'll even throw in the tongue .
lips still for sale ?
i am a professional man .
very professional .
suck my dick !
sez you !
i 'm not dumping you , i 'm suspending you .
you think i 'm dumping you to get back into bowling . well who 's dumping who ?
your word is so good , you 're never gon na give it to anyone .
fuck plan c !
what about plan c ?
my word is good , and it 'll always be good . when did i ever give my word to you ?
i 'm pissing you off ? i 'm doing what i said i 'd do . what the hell are you doing ? what about your word ?
you 're really pissing me off .
who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . hurry up , he 's probably in purgatory by now . sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again .
what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ? huh ?
sshheeiillaaa !
now he 's the one who 's locked up and i 'm the one who 's free . if i got ta do this alone , i might as well start now . she revs up and peals out .
i 've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life . she walks over to her scooter , and mounts it .
back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of sheila .
i did n't come this far to bury a guy that 's not my dad . he owes me .
theo , buzz is dead .
plan c. from now on it 's gon na be plan c. both bodies throb and grind , their sandy hands sliding over each others ' sweaty skin .
say something , theo . give me something . a doll 's legs catch fire . theo stares into sheila 's eyes .
at least i 'll die smiling .
you do n't get two chances with junior .
i killed him once , i 'll just have to kill him again .
if junior finds us , he 'll kill us both .
when i 'm with you sheila , i do n't even think about bowling . theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately . she stops him and looks around nervously .
why did you come back ?
i did your dirty work for you sheila , now fuck off . theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone . she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression , then turns on her heel .
can i come with you ?
i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz . he gets into his car .
where are you going ?
i did n't stop to take his pulse .
are you sure he 's dead ?
you should .
i feel sick .
he 's dead sheila .
if he 's not dead , he 'll keep coming back .
you wanted me to kill him , did n't you ?
tell me what happened theo .
how do you get this thing down ?
did you - kill him ?
oh great ! he tried to kill me ! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you .
we would have sooner or later .
what the hell did you go doing that for sheila ? we have n't even gotten naked yet !
i told him you were my boyfriend .
it . bouncy-bouncy . fucked . he tried to squeeze my fucking head off . what did you say to him ? when they reach each other , they stop . sheila seems to weigh her answer .
it ?
you told junior that we did it .
i 'll be at the bridge .
you do n't have to do this . we could just cut out of here , go to akron , or anywhere else .
these open the back door . do n't let him catch you behind the machines ; if he does , you 're trapped . i 'll meet you at the bridge . theo takes the keys . sheila grabs his arm .
he 's my father .
i ca n't - i ca n't do it . he 's my brother .
it 's junior , is n't it .
i 'm afraid you 'll hurt him .
tell me , sheila . what are you afraid of ? sheila shakes her head .
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles . theo takes sheila by the shoulders .
why not ?
i ca n't tell you , theo .
are you fucking with me sheila ? is something gon na happen to buzz ? sheila seems to be trying to tell theo , but is unable .
no , but something 's gon na blow in this town . i can feel it .
you got any broken bones ?
you know how people with broken bones know when there 's a storm coming ?
too late for what , sheila ?
nothing .
way too late . buzz fazeli is history . too late for what ?
and besides , it 's probably too late , anyhow .
zip .
yeah , what did buzz fazeli ever do for you ?
why should i help that old fuck .
i 'm sure you would n't care if he needed your help , right ?
nope , i could n't care less .
it would n't bother you if buzz was in danger , would it ?
... lane six . yes .
then it 's true , is n't it ? about ...
what about the guy he put in the body cast ?
you 're here .
what are you going to do about your brother ?
if you want a professional man , you have to be willing to pay for him .
you professional men drive a hard bargain . i 'm afraid i only have five on me . sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill .
i could let them go for ten .
come on , bargain with me .
more than you could afford .
how much would you charge me for the lips ?
i may not be a pro bowler , but i 'm no amateur man . sheila moves closer to theo .
yeah , but they 're all little wannabes . i 'm looking for a professional man .
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers .
i 'm a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i 'm trapped in his easy payment plan .
so why do you stay ?
my mom told me not to stay in this town .
it 's been awhile . she did n't want me looking for my dad .
do you talk with your mom ?
really ? i kinda like it .
i do n't think your new outfit suits you , theo .
plan c ... ... is me .
what 's plan c ?
come on theo , what about plan c ?
sheila , please .
what ? be my body guard ? here 's my body , theo . guard it . for my dad 's sake . for your career . sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt .
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days .
oh really ? nothing ? my dad does n't do anything unless there 's something in it for him .
nothing .
ha ! and what do you have to do for him ?
he said he 'd sponsor me .
what do you think my dad 's gon na do for you ?
plan b is your dad .
what 's plan b ?
well , that was plan a .
so you 're hoping buzz can get you re- instated ?
i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling .
why were you suspended ?
no , i 'm fascinated .
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks did n't really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats , i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i 'm not insulting you .
i do n't know . it 's all i ever wanted to do .
theo , what would you do if you could n't bowl ?
we 'll get into that later .
do i want you ?
so , what about you ?
unfortunately what he wants is you .
nobody in this town really understands junior . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually , he 's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates ?
no . not at the present .
no . do you ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
not while i 'm in training .
do you have a girlfriend ?
i 'd rather you did n't .
can i ask you something personal ?
the ladies in akron call them thigh- ticklers .
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party , theo .
no , not at all .
mind if i cut in ?
it 's a vicious cycle .
whoa .
he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , they send him to the nut-hut for a while ...
what does he do ?
the mental hospital .
where did your brother escape from ?
everything has it 's drawbacks .
kinda tough on the butt .
when i 'm on my bike i feel like a wild person . better than any sex i 've ever had .
is n't this technically a scooter ?
i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do .
this is a vicious cycle .
your dad 's one of the only nice people in this fucking town . my dad is slime . kastle walks over . theo stands up and shakes kastle 's proffered hand .
having a legend for a dad is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
wo n't your father help you with that ?
business .
what do you want with my dad ?
i came here to have a word with your dad .
i 'm not here to - i ca n't ...
here theo , it 's the fazeli specialty ; a seven-ten split . theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing .
yeah , babylon . buzz runs the lanes there for my dad . everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad . theo splits .
do you know where they 're taking him ?
mine , and they never tip .
do those two work for your dad or mine ?
coming right up .
uh ... over easy .
how do you want it ? the eggs .
then i 'll have the number four with one of your finest whips .
whips ... orange whips .
what 's your specialty ?
ow ! ooh ! no , please ! doc said i 'd be back on the planks in a week ! show him breeze ! breeze pulls a copy of `` new york bowler '' from his pocket . the headline reads `` rub out ! : bowling legend kacked by dwarfscam kingpin '' with a photo of buzz fazeli .
you faked my dad 's murder . you used him ! where is he ! theo chases sid and breeze around their car . he catches sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand . sid howls .
i 'm the next of kin . i should 've seen him .
the body was identified along proper bowling congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality .
who identified the body ?
your time is up , busyboy .
why is junior 's watch in that coffin ? something stinks around here .
you call it stooling , we call it cooperating . breeze looks under theo 's car .
so , buzz was stooling for you guys .
you should probably hit the road . go home . this place could get hazardous for your health .
what are you gon na do , call the bowling police ?
dwarf bowling 's illegal .
very good , busyboy .
breeze , give him his ball back !
tell your little pal to let go .
aagh ! stop ! those are my bowling fingers !
basement bingo ?
we provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community .
you guys got something going on downstairs ?
if you wan na do business in this town , there 's other people around here got more weight than old faz .
some unfinished business .
i 'm looking for somebody .
you drag that coconut around for your health , or do you know how to use it ?
i 'm not here to bowl .
lane 's closed big fellah , league night .
dr. levine , please ! return to your seat !
open it , captain !
... your civil rights have been overridden !
please , dr. levine .
let me out , captain . open the door !
calm down , dr. levine .
captain , open the hatch door , please ... the hatch door , captain . open it , please .
i ca n't ...
fletcher ! now !
i ca n't see ...
get out of there !
it 's burning ...
fletcher , get away from there ...
fletcher , i want you back here .
they 're warm . i can feel the heat on my legs .
they 're like pink snow , sir . sticky .
fletcher ? what are you doing out there ?
pull it , damn it !
norman , please ! do n't !
now !
do n't do it !
norman , do n't do it !
do it , norman , it 's the only choice we have . this thing is gon na crush us .
do n't pull it , norman . it 'll start a < u > fire < /u > we ca n't stop . norman ?
do you see it ?
do n't do it , norman !
it 's either that or we grow gills .
that 's our reserve air .
increase positive pressure !
he 's right beneath us .
what was that ?
why ca n't i -- ? what the hell is going on here ?
where is it ?
what are you saying -- we ca n't stop what 's out there ?
thirty yards .
sure . each time it started fires inside the habitat .
but you 've tested it ?
forty yards .
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface . but we 've never used it underwater before .
high voltage ?
we 're a habitat . not a castle . the only defense we have is high voltage .
what do we use for defense ?
fifty yards and closing .
what if it attacks ?
a squid ? the size of a whale ? i do n't think so . target acquired . sixty yards .
what was that ?
direction 's east coming !
shut up , beth . i do n't want to hear it .
nice work , captain sir .
you 're a fucking biochemist , are n't you ? ca n't you tell us something .
i 'm not sure . i 've never seen anything like it .
nobody move !
but she 's --
nobody move .
forgive me . i 've never read the navy manual . i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures .
there are procedures , beth , that i want followed . my procedures . and considering what 's going on , i want you to follow them very closely .
yeah . i heard you .
back at the door -- i asked you to back away .
two and a half days ?
they told me about sixty hours .
how long will that be ?
the surface ships will be back . after the storm clears .
edmunds , do you have a 20 on norman ?
norman !
what are you -- his mother ? get norman , i want everyone ready to go . edmunds , the subs ?
i am not leaving without him . do you hear me ? we come down as a team , we leave as a team .
yeasts ? thank you , beth , but i do n't think we 're gon na open it up and find a loaf of bread .
not everything . even on earth . take ... yeasts .
how about i just press the button ?
alright , beth , do that thing you did before .
any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up ?
what is it ?
hold on --
would you wait a minute ?
i said back away .
wait a minute --
back away then .
there 's heat coming the door .
basic english ? there 's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet .
in basic english , what does all this mean ?
of what we 're able to measure , roughly twenty-six hundred feet .
how big is this spacecraft ?
pull it .
i see it .
you see the lever on the green box ? upper right hand corner ?
yes , sir . i 'm here .
ted , go into the control room . listen for my instructions .
jerry ? please . stop this .
what the hell ? it shut us down .
jerry ?
going active .
no . i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat . he might be listening now .
maybe so . but i think we need to ask jerry about it .
bullshit . what 's out there is n't alien . it 's an animal .
yes , i do . whatever 's out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier .
you think he killed edmunds ?
but sir , i think it 's imperative . i think the messages , the animals we 've seen , what killed edmunds , the reading you got earlier -- i think they 're all related .
i do n't want you talking to jerry .
at least our obituaries will be accurate . that 's reassuring .
if something should happen to us , the navy will at least have partial records of what happened .
what for ?
edmunds ? can you copy ?
... it raises a very serious question : < u > what happens if jerry < /u > < u > gets mad < /u > ?
damn it , edmunds ?
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional ...
edmunds ?
i think we should be careful . consider his emotional response .
you do n't think weapons are important ?
that 's smart . let 's talk about guns and violence .
great , okay . ask him about his weapons .
what am i -- a dog , now ?
the message does n't show a lack of intelligence . it 's smart . it 's approaching us in a simple way . like you would a dog . holding out your hand , letting it sniff , get used to you .
he translated it wrong . `` my name is jerry '' ? it 's like `` see spot run . ''
-- without a cautionary word to anyone . you know , ted said something to me earlier . i think he 's right . he said , `` when you got a guy who -- if he was n't here -- he 'd be standing in the unemployment line , you got ta question if you got the right guy . ''
-- i did n't know it would come to this --
-- and then brought her down here --
wait a second --
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
at the time , i do n't know , i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break .
so you knew this when you wrote your report ?
'81 , i think . she tried again five years ago . i thought you should know .
when was this ?
she put a razor to her wrists a day later .
she should 've known better .
a while back , beth and i -- we worked at the same university . she was assisting a chemist there -- i forget his name -- doing research , experiments . she was also living with him . yeah , i know . and when she finished her work , he kicked her out , broke off the relationship , and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement .
i think i do .
you do n't want to know .
how drastic ?
i 'm not paranoid . i know beth . she can be drastic .
no `` buts '' . if he wants to be left , we 'll leave him . hello ? yes , the subs -- i want a report ... hello ... yes , a report . gim me ... shit .
but sir --
i told you people , nobody goes anywhere unless i say .
you ca n't just leave harry down here , sir .
he 's here somewhere . find him . the sub 's on it 's way . go ! c'mon !
he 's missing . he 's gone . he left .
what do you mean , he 's missing ?
harry 's missing .
just worry about yourself .
all i 'm saying is , someone should keep an eye on him .
look , the ships are clearing out . they 're taking us topside in a matter of minutes . someone can check him out there , if it 's that imprtant .
i 'm telling you , harry 's lost it . he 's saying there 's a deathwish out for each of us .
do n't get hysterical , norman .
everything can be killed .
i do n't know . that 's the point .
you mean , what 's in that thing is immortal ?
or maybe , it ca n't < u > be < /u > killed .
like `` thou shall not kill '' ?
if it is alien , maybe we should n't try to open it at all .
what ?
maybe we should n't .
i do n't know . but it 's something alien .
picked up something ? what is it ?
take a look .
what is it , norman ?
it 's a corrosive gas . on earth , it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly , iron rust on an oldsmobile . at a pressure this low , oxygen becomes toxic . breathe it down here , and it 'll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile .
what 's wrong with oxygen ?
they pressurize us with helium .
but sir , i do n't understand . this report -- these recommendations ... they 're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life .
your report 's become our bible down here , dr. johnson . we 've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail .
ulf report ? nobody 's mentioned that in years . you mean someone actually read it ?
the one you recommended . in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration .
what team ?
we think it might . that 's why we brought you here . we 've assembled your team -- they 're waiting for us now .
it does n't make any sense .
off the record , i do n't mind telling you , this thing scares the shit out of me .
i 'm afraid it is dr. johnson ... because it 's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor .
it 's impossible .
extraordinary , is n't it ?
-- there 's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft ? there 's no such thing ... our space program is n't even forty years old .
maybe older --
hold on --
-- dating the crash at least that old .
-- wait a second --
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
geologists ?
see this ? coral . geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick .
as best we can estimate , it crashed four hundred years ago .
not really , no . something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news , why you 've kept everything a secret ... when did it crash ?
something like that . that does n't surprise you ?
what is it ? a military spacecraft ? like a shuttle or satellite ?
what do you need me for ?
what ?
then why am i here ?
survivors ? no , i would n't think so .
a thousand ? an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- i do n't want to sound pessimistic here , but i assume there are no survivors .
a thousand feet .
how deep is he ?
they did n't tell me anything .
a cyclone 's on it 's way in . i thought they would have told you on the phone .
storm ? what storm ?
we 're moving fast considering the storm .
well , we do n't have all the facts yet .
from what ? what 's with all the security ?
good . security 's been our biggest worry . now that you 're here we can shut this thing down tight .
press ? no , i have n't .
you talk to any reporters ? any press ?
nothing else .
anything else ?
the usual . plane crash . survivers unknown . routine stuff really .
what have you been told so far ?
what team ?
come with me . the team 's already waiting .
the pentagon ? i did n't know i had friends in washington .
do n't thank me , dr. johnson . you were n't my choice . the pentagon made me take you .
well , thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it .
captain . right , forgive me .
captain .
thank you , colonel .
in a minute , sir .
edmunds , get in here . i need you for this .
if the subs are n't here yet , sir --
norman , get out of there now ! norman ?
sir ! sir , the door -- it 's opening .
they 've left , keep watching !
sir , if the subs have n't left by now ...
in the ship , sir .
well , where the fuck is he ?
yes , sir .
what the hell is going on here ?
nothing , sir .
fuck him . what ? hello ?
nothing , sir .
any sign of harry ?
they 're coming .
i 'm getting no sub reading , sir .
send them , damn it ! i know , but i 'm not gon na be held responsible --
subs are still at surface , sir .
harry ? can you copy ?
get him out of there . i thought i told you people --
nothing . i do n't know . everything was normal . no changes at all .
what caused it ?
well , shit -- find something , do something ... make something up --
we do n't have anything else to try , sir .
thank you , i can see that . try something else .
it 's not sucking , sir .
working on it now , sir .
can you open that panel ?
if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gon na appear to us like magic .
she wired this system .
she 's not gon na know .
edmunds ? get in here . i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted .
what -- you want me to retype it ?
with an `` o '' . harold with an `` o '' .
i 'm in charge .
he 's saying , `` take me to your leader . '' he wants to know who 's in charge .
what ?
she 's not gon na know , sir .
not now , beth . please . i want to know who we 're talking to before we start talking . where 's edmunds ?
he understands me fine .
are you enjoying yourself , harry , because i do n't know what the hell you 're doing .
it 's not ignorant .
ignorant . the thing 's ignorant .
how do you mean , strange ?
i have to tell you . it 's strange .
what 's the message ?
... spiralling out of the center , you see : `` g '' is one , `` b '' is two , `` h '' is three , and so on ... when i got the message .
we 're all very proud of you , harry , but what the hell is it ?
it 's a single sequence repeated over and over .
please watch your closest monitor ...
who is that ? where 's that coming from ?
ladies and gentlemen ...
gim me a report , i want --
just tell me worst case . worst case of what we might find ?
let 's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us , just like we are to , say , medieval europe . suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set . there would n't be any place to plug it in .
you do n't know that .
it could . but the odds of it being any use to us are against it .
or it could contain some great benefit to us , some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind .
it 's nonsense . there 's enough difference between our own species to prove that .
so ? what 's the problem ?
the what ?
man is man , all he knows is man , and all he can think of is what he knows . the anthropomorphic problem . good , norman .
ted seems to have some ideas .
so how do we get it open ?
a break for what ?
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere .
what ?
no . they do n't represent a message . they are n't decorative at all . they have another purpose entirely .
so do we . and it seems to have picked up something on it 's travels .
we know how this craft got here . where it 's been .
yes , harry .
ted ? captain ?
then how can it be chipped ?
i did .
i thought you said there was n't any damage done in the crash ?
i do n't know how it can be chipped , but it 's chipped .
chipped ? the door ? how can it be chipped ?
it 's chipped .
i 'm not saying anything , harry , i 'm just stating the facts . the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy , built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb . the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented .
right . so you 're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch ?
to the craft ? none . not a scratch .
how much damage ?
in the dome hanger . all our tapes are transferred to the sub . it 's on a 12 hour timer . if someone does n't reset the `` delay '' button , the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes .
what sub ?
resetting the sub .
what was edmunds doing outside ?
well , until we know exactly what it is , nobody goes outside , understood ?
too big ?
it wo n't register . it 's too big to image .
what ?
the sensors are picking up something outside .
what is that ?
do n't make stuff up , these emotional theories , just so you can feel important here .
edmunds ?
give him a chance . he 's speaking our language , not the other way around .
it 's not talking , it 's mimicking .
i am not gon na explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named jerry .
captain , i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
i want a name . a real name . this thing 's full name , rank and serial number .
what 's inside the sphere .
from the sphere ?
get out of there . i do n't want anyone going anywhere outside , understood ?
she says jellyfish are a delicacy . you know , i never knew that .
internal power .
to what ?
they switched us over .
we 're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he ca n't just walk outside !
sir , about leaving --
how can he be missing ?
ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now !
did you hear me , sir , because --
what ? no , i know they 're civilians ...
can i stay , sir ? i 'm willing to risk it . i am . after what we just witnessed .
maybe it 's a message of some sort , you know ? see this red here .
but what does it do ? this ... sphere .
maybe we did n't want to come back .
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back ?
time travel . i always thought it was one of those myths ... like santa 's reindeer .
considered what ? that it 's american ? how would you think it 's american ?
we had considered it .
what do you make of this ?
what 's wrong ?
a foot and a half thick ? that 'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation .
radiation shield , you think ?
some sort of lead or something .
what is it ?
look at this .
what are you going to do -- shoot her ?
ted , get her away from the door .
what if we go out there , you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open .
what < u > about < /u > a crowbar ?
duly noted , ted . edmunds , try using suction .
i 'd also like it noted --
nobody goes inside , until we know < u > what 's < /u > inside .
captain , you know , i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television .
the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we 've seen .
a half a mile long ?
down below , harry said we would all have to die . since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone . death was the only logical explanation . but sitting here , we still know . so how is that possible ? unless we make ourselves forget .
how 's that ?
yes . and i think we already know it will .
would it work ?
get away --
beth --
get away from me !
hear what ?
you hear that ?
what ?
what is that ? what are you doing ?
let 's get out of here , beth . let 's go home .
top shelf , is it ?
c'mon --
oh , sure . here . anything else , beth can get you ? some more chicken , perhaps . let beth check the fridge .
beth -- gim me the gun .
do n't tell me about me . i already know too much .
i --
oh please , do n't shrink me , norman . not now .
i know . you 're too strong , beth .
you ca n't stop it , norman . you ca n't fight me .
leave me alone , norman .
beth ?
it 's you , norman . your fear of drowning . you have to face it .
stop it !
from you , norman . from your mind . you 're doing it .
then where 's it coming from ?
stop what ? do n't blame me . it 's not me .
beth , stop it !
do n't you know ?
where is it coming from , beth ?
you 're frightened , are n't you , norman ?
beth !
i 'm not fucking with you , norman . you 've fucked yourself .
do n't fuck with me , beth .
of course you 're going to deny it . you want to blame someone else . you want to blame beth . because you hate beth .
get away from the door , beth .
this is what i 'm talking about , norman . do n't you see ? it 's in you . this vindictiveness . this rage .
you think i care ? you think i care if i die ? would i put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically , if i cared about myself ? would i ? i 've tried twice before , norman , why would n't i try a third time ? i 'm not thinking about myself -- no , norman , i 'm thinking about you . your safety . protecting you from your own self .
it 's not safe for you to be either .
it 's your choice . because it 's not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .
it 's either this ... or i kill you .
do n't , beth . please .
you think i 'd belive you ? believe anything you might say now ? after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past . about my problems . my problems . not yours . not his . mine .
beth --
promise what , norman ? tell me !
i promise --
but i have to , norman .
do n't , beth .
`` it 's not me , beth . it 's not me . it ca n't be . i 'm not doing anything . '' just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle .
it 's not me , beth . i swear . it ca n't be .
i 'm not scaring you , am i norman ? i hope i 'm not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , do n't you ?
when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i ca n't get beth on the radio . i 'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . '' was it really the squid that was attacking you , norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ?
shut up , beth --
no , it is n't . your name is norman . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the one you could n't save . what was his name ? `` mommy , we 're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . '' `` but i do n't want to go swimming , norman . i 'm scared . '' `` c'mon , < u > harry < /u > , it 'll be fine , it 'll be fun . '' you heartless fuck . that 's why you 're so scared of the water , is n't it ?
beth , the message said harry . `` my name is harry '' . my name is n't harry .
is it ?
that 's bullshit .
you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere , you remember that -- when the sphere opened ? that 's right . but you ca n't remember going inside , can you ? no , of course not . harry could n't either , could he ? `` like everything 's on the tip of my tongue '' , he said .
yes .
you do n't remember you did . but i 'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry , do n't you ? you remember that .
i never went in that sphere .
am i ? or am i making so much sense that you 're going insane ?
you 're insane .
did i ? or was that you ? when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened , did n't you ? terrified . like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor . you did that , norman .
you manifested that , beth .
one lonely , terrifying sea snake .
that 's when you went in the sphere .
and the snakes ? you want to know about the snakes ? you saw one outside earlier , did n't you ? when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified .
but --
am i lying ? are you sure ? are you absolutely sure i 'm lying ? then explain to me about the jellyfish . earlier . why did we see jellyfish ? harry does n't fear jellyfish . you do . they 're your fear , are n't they ?
you 're lying --
c'mon -- what ?
beth you 're losing it . c'mon .
yes , someone did . but it was n't me , norman . it was you . you manifested the snakes .
someone did .
you think i manifested the snakes ?
then why , beth ? why go in ? why put out explosives ? why manifest the snakes ?
no , he ca n't .
he ca n't manifest .
no , he is n't .
against what ? harry 's unconscious . he 's not a threat .
same reason i put explosives around the habitat . for defense . for the power . to protect myself .
why did you go in the sphere , beth ?
what 's the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ?
did you ?
if i was , then i would 've had to have gone in the sphere , would n't i ?
are you manifesting them ?
do n't you ?
do you fear them ?
you tell me .
what are they doing down here ? in the bathroom ? suddenly appearing .
am i afraid of them ? not during the day . sea snakes are diurnal . when the sun 's out , they do n't bite . fortunately for you , i had on my watch . this is quite good .
you know what i mean .
snakes ? what do you mean , exactly ?
how do you feel about snakes ?
i did do that , did n't i ?
you put explosives around the habitat , i ca n't imagine what you 'd put in a drink .
you do n't think i put something in it , do you ?
you think i 'd really drink that ?
it 's getting cold .
are you ?
i 'm feeling better .
what 's wrong , norman ?
oh yes , my watch . i almost forgot .
your watch .
what was that ? i could n't hear you .
how 's harry ?
the grooves around the door -- they 've shifted . and the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now .
what do you mean , different ?
the sphere looks different .
in the sub . resetting the timer . why ?
where are you ?
what is it , norman ?
you 're not sorry . you 're scared . you 're a psychologist , norman . you pride yourself on knowing when someone 's lying to you , not telling you the truth . and now you 're scared ... because you 're not sure you can tell anymore .
not believing you .
for what ?
i 'm sorry .
only lab rats . here .
thirty years ago . in residency . i passed out . you ?
you ever given an injection before .
look , it 's either him or us , norman . another attack , and we go down with this place .
you want to kill him ?
to be on the safe side . i mean --
beth --
it 's an idea .
what if it takes 20 minutes , norman ? what if it takes an hour ? and he can fight it off ? we ca n't afford that .
does n't say .
how fast does it take effect ?
what ? wait -- is n't that dangerous ?
i 'll just boost the doses .
three to six hours .
how long does it last ?
`` 20 cc 's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc 's of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures ... no cardiac side effects ... rem activity is surpressed ... ``
`` ... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride ... ``
it 's like a sleeping pill ?
causes sleep .
what 's that ?
it 's a soporific .
p-a-r-a-s-o ...
how do you spell it ?
parasolutrine ?
antibiotic .
damn it ! chloramphenicol ?
antihistamine . for bites .
riordan ?
`` ... and may also cause bizarre halucinations '' .
bingo .
tranquilizer . causes drowsiness .
tarazine ?
nothing about drowsiness .
does it cause drowsiness ? that 's all we need . to get him unconscious -- put him under .
a synthetic opium analogue .
sintag .
ulcers .
valdomet .
it 's for motion sickness .
ephedrine hydrochloride .
something for burns .
diphenyl parlene .
why would harry go back to using a code ?
looks like some sort of code .
must be . and if it is -- it 's a part of him not even he can control .
and that 's the part of harry that 's being manifested .
no . i mean , we 've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences . you ever read the bible ? it talks about our sinful nature , you know ? i mean , we can think , and believe , and desire whatever we want , but there 's a part of us -- a shadow side , as jung called it -- that ca n't be controlled . it 's evil . it 's inside us . it 's what we are .
his dream ? you ca n't control your dreams . and you ca n't control your fears , can you ?
he must not realize he is . like the navy crewman -- harry was sleeping then . he must 've manifested his dream .
but why is he doing it ?
it 's his fear . the squid . he 's manifesting his fears . making them real .
which i told barnes was attacking --
i do n't know , beth . i 'm not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when harry came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page 87. how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid ...
how can the sphere do that ?
i do n't know .
but how ?
he acquired some sort of power . a power to manifest things .
you think , in the sphere --
when did the messages start ? the animals outside start showing up ? after harry came out of the sphere .
what do you mean , a part of harry ?
remember when we first spoke to jerry , barnes kept asking for jerry 's real name ? but harry never would ? he did n't because he was afraid the screen would say `` harry '' , instead of jerry . we were n't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry , we were talking to harry ... or a part of harry .
what ?
he translated it wrong .
created . brought to life . i do n't know . but at the end , jerry said , `` stop calling me jerry '' . and --
manifested ?
after the attack , a navy guy woke me up -- i do n't know -- i thought he was an illusion . but i checked the tape , and jerry said he manifested him .
`` ... according to calculations of some naturalists , one of these animals , only six feet long , would have tentacles 27 feet long . that would make a formidable monster . ''
squids ?
`` our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long . some skeletons of squids ...
page 87 . `` i could never read that far . ''
what ?
page 87 .
damn it , norman ! he 's lying . do n't you get it ? there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he 's causing it . why ca n't you believe me ?
i do n't know , beth . i was n't there .
you think it 's me ? you think i 'm saying there was a conversation when there was n't ?
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .
damn it , norman . i swear . i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up .
all i know is i opened that refridgerator --
you do n't believe me .
you think ?
no , it was n't . i swear none of this was here . none of it . you think he hid it ? earlier . he must 've hid it .
did you look ? it was on the top shelf .
none of this was here before .
1-800-deepsea delivery . i hear they 're good .
wait a second --
we must 've had it delivered then .
that was n't in there before .
it 's a pretty common place to look for food when you do n't think you have any .
the refridgerator .
the refridgerator .
fixing it ? but i fixed -- where 'd you get all that ?
fixing it .
what 's harry doing with your suit in there ?
i think so , beth . yes .
you get it straightened out ?
he what ?
deserts you ? harry said he 'd take over for me .
yeah , well , i get that way when i 'm facing death and someone deserts me .
getting food . we were out of food . what 's wrong ? you sound mad .
what are you doing in the ship ? beth ?
... what do you mean ? i 'm in the ship .
still clear .
still clear ?
you ca n't . counter 's at 10 minutes . you do n't have time .
my air is n't ... i 'm coming back .
yes , norman . i did . you 're just nervous .
you fixed this suit ? beth ?
what 's the matter ?
still clear .
i ca n't see anything . how does it look ? still clear ?
the sub 's a 100 feet in front of you . you see it ?
you press a button , norman . it 's not brain surgery . here , go ahead . you only have 15 minutes to reset it . go on , norman ...
but i do n't know how --
you do n't trust me ?
you fixed my suit ?
i fixed your suit .
i would . but my suit --
i do n't trust harry to do it .
in case you die , too ?
you should know how it works . just in case .
why should i go ?
maybe you should go . to the sub .
get the helium out of our bloodstream . we go to the surface now , we 'd pop like a soda bottle .
four days ?
we ca n't . the storm . the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here . and we have four days of decompression when we get up top .
wake him , then . let 's go . get outta --
you , me and harry . he 's asleep .
you , me and harry ?
it 's also our only way out of here ! it holds three people . and there 's only three of us left now .
it 's not worth the risk .
do n't bother me , norman .
forget the sub .
i have to reset the sub .
where are you going in such a hurry ?
no , i should stay calm . like you say . right , norman ? stay calm .
beth --
yeah , okay . sure , norman .
beth , i did n't . hold it together . alright ?
you bastard .
do n't do this .
you did , did n't you ?
beth --
you told him about me ?
what ?
you said something to him , did n't you ?
it 's done , alright ? it 's over ! and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it now , okay ?
do n't tell me to calm down !
calm down , beth . alright ?
he 's not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon .
you went through edmunds ' things ?
in edmunds ' things .
where did you get this ?
`` although advised of risks , all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft . signed , barnes , usn . ''
fuck you , norman ! it 's right here ...
you 're jumping to conclusions , beth . do n't get worked up --
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute ? nobody .
so what ?
yeah , he < u > told < /u > you . think . what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose ? he was on the phone . except that cable is a thousand feet long , norman . they would 've broken off communication with us four , five minutes before they cleared out .
c'mon , beth . do n't make this personal . he told me himself they were taking us back .
... he lied to us . he left us down here .
eggs .
what are they ?
norman .
what could have done this ?
she was crushed . feel her skin -- it 's like sandpaper .
i ca n't feel her bones . she 's like a sponge .
beth .
i did n't do anything wrong . i did n't mean ...
beth --
nobody said ... norman ... what ? why are you looking at me like that ?
beth .
what ? ... wait . do n't ... why are you --
they are or they are n't . which is it ?
i mean , i 'm not ... i was n't absolutely sure if ... they --
beth --
what ? why ...
and you did n't tell anyone ?
yeah , why ?
you knew about the squid not being normal . before fletcher went out there ?
what ?
wait a minute .
they have six tentacles . a new species . and the squid too . they had no stomach .
what do you mean -- not normal ?
normally , i 'd say no . everything 's quiet now -- no ships , no divers , no electricity . makes sense . but what 's curious is -- these are n't normal jellyfish .
me ? well , i was wrapped in seaweed . it itched for a while , but i survived . beth , do you find it ... curious that we 're seeing all this life down here . nothing , and then these enormous flocks of squid . then jellyfish ?
what about you ? what happened to you ?
yeah , it was awful .
my gosh , norman .
... when i was six , my younger brother and i -- we went swimming in the pacific . at my mother 's beach house . we both felt stinging , and when we came out of the water , he was wearing jellyfish head to toe . killed him .
no , thank you . i hate jellyfish .
a bad one . it was the only book in there . norman , come here , look at this .
we have a library ?
the library .
where 'd this come from ?
disrupt our brain waves , interfere with our ability to think .
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas .
get this thing off me .
norman !
good theory , ted .
400 years ago ? i 'm sure christopher columbus would 've loved these accomodations .
such a gentlemen when you 're scared shitless .
no . go ahead . really . ladies first .
you 're next , norman .
yeah . drowning .
is n't there a psychological term for that , dr. johnson ?
what -- are you threatening me ?
just keep your mouth shut , alright ? this could mean everything to our careers , you know that ? do n't jeopardize this .
the timing has never seemed quite right .
well , let 's pray that 's the only mistake you made . have you said anything to barnes about this ?
it never occurred to me .
well , you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here . in the ocean . 70 percent of the earth 's surface is water , norman . that 's first grade geography .
we ca n't go down there . we 're not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , beth . we 're just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?
underwater ?
to the spacecraft . to investigate .
wait -- down where ?
because when we get down there --
c'mon , beth -- that report 's like the blind leading the blind .
do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? do n't tell anyone what you just told me .
i spent a week reading sagan and watching re-runs of the twilight zone . seriously . i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
that 's quite a secret .
it 's bullshit . the report 's a joke .
i 've read it twice , norman . it 's brilliant .
that ulf report everybody 's patting me on the back about ?
i love secrets .
beth , look , can i trust you with a little secret ?
who says it 's a he ?
he does n't wait for an answer .
by the bunks .
norman ? where 's norman ?
i 'm a woman . i do n't theorize . i only deal with facts .
well , what 's your theory ?
it does n't make any sense .
i do n't get it .
well , they 're not mine .
well , think . because there 's footprints here that are n't mine .
no . i do n't think so .
what 's that -- mistake number two , norman ?
pussy .
wo n't make any difference . the tapes document everything .
we can refuse to talk .
they 're going to want answers and they 're going to keep asking until they get them .
yes you are ...
no i 'm not . i 'm not star --
you 're staring at me .
like what ? i 'm not --
why are you looking at me like that ?
another attack ?
our habitat , i mean . this place ca n't handle another attack .
just in time for what ?
what ?
in time for what ?
just in time , too .
yeah , i do n't know how you could make that confusion .
i 'm sorry . slip of the tongue .
that 's a hell of a mistake to make , beth .
jerry . right . i said jerry , did n't i ?
harry ? that 's bullshit . we stood right there --
we never even had a conversation , norman .
yes you did . norman , i would n't leave you out there . you know that .
i never said that .
when he woke up , he said we were out of food . he told me to get some from the ship .
cannibalism , to be extreme . and now we 're talking about a new life form . their values and ethics may be incomprehensible .
take politics , our views on abortion , the death penalty ...
a light switch . a button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power .
what are you looking for ?
it 's an american spacecraft .
then what is it ?
you 'd have to ask them .
it 's empty . why would someone build a ship like this ?
for whoever 's in that thing .
for who ? the fish ?
all that banging and pounding . i do n't know . we should think about making a good first impression .
pry the thing open ? what are we -- neanderthals ?
harry thinks it 's some sort of discharge from our own system , but i 've seen it discharge before -- and it did n't look anything like this .
is it coming from our own computer ?
no idea . we have no surface support . it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater .
where 's it coming from ?
minutes ago . harry 's trying to decode it in his room now .
when did it come across ?
it would erase all our knowledge of it . all of our power .
you mean forget ?
the power allows us to manifest our fears , right ? what if we feared the power to go away ?
we all kill ourselves ? bad joke . sorry , beth .
there is one possibility .
no . i do n't . but i always said to myself , when i die , i want to die laughing .
good . thank you . now that i have it on . why are you laughing ? you do n't even know what that means .
how 's that working out , by the way ?
it 's not fast enough , norman . there 's a helluva lot of explosive down there .
nine hundred feet to surface .
less than a minute , we 're never gon na make it .
wait !
well , press something !
no idea .
you know how to work this thing ?
i 'm trying . there .
get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . harry ?
you got her ?
her legs are in the way .
just pull her -- down like inside -- harry , work with me here !
gim me a second --
i 'm trying to keep balance with --
c'mon , norman !
shut up and catch .
three fifty-six , three fifty-five , three --
i heard ! i heard !
hurry , norman . four minutes .
hold on .
are you trying , damn it ? just --
missed .
i 'm trying . shit . here -- catch her .
push her , c'mon .
hold on .
i ca n't reach her .
how far away 's the sub ?
two and a half minutes . once we 're in the sub .
how much time you figure to get to the surface ?
shut up and open the door .
we 're never gon na make it .
help me lift her .
fine .
i could hit her a little harder . more toward the cranium .
i do n't think so .
did i kill her ?
stop what ? what are you -- ?
it 's the squid ! stop it !
you know what it is , harry .
what is it ?
is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag ?
that 's right .
the three of us .
we just figured , you know , the three of us -- we need to ... work together through this .
do n't have to . watch . it 'll do it for you .
how do we decode it ?
navy transmission . they 're sent from wisconsin .
wisconsin ?
wisconsin 's your answer .
she 's lying , norman . just like she lied about fixing your suit .
but why would she -- ?
i was just in the cafeteria , there 's plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .
you did n't say that about the food ?
she 's cracking , norman .
i thought she was with you .
beth left ?
her suit 's gone .
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me .
when i woke up , nobody was here .
what do you mean ? she 's not here ?
what happened to her ?
thank you . my suit -- beth said she fixed it --
you 're clear . you see the airlock ?
i ca n't breathe ... am i ... clear ?
norman , where are you ?
harry ?
... you there ? norman ?
i do n't remember much . it 's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but i ca n't taste any of it . funny , my senses are much keener though . purer . hearing , seeing , smelling . like , i can smell your sheets , norman . you tried to wash it out earlier , but i can still smell the urine . do n't worry , i 'm not going to tell the others . it 's normal , really , is n't it ? in a crisis . the stress . the panic .
you do n't remember that ?
did i ?
you said something to me , before -- about how we were all going to die .
do n't do this . do n't psychoanalyze me . i hate squid . period . just like you hate jellyfish .
have you looked outside ? jellyfish . everywhere . i hate jellyfish . harry , what happened in the cafeteria ?
there 's some sort of pattern here . it 'll take a minute .
getting anywhere with those ?
what are they ?
these are n't half bad , fletcher . you might have a second career coming .
that far in what , harry ?
i could never read that far . i never wanted to .
page 87 of what , harry ?
what happens on page 87 ? have you ever read page 87 ?
what is it , harry ?
norman ?
then explain it to me .
you do n't understand about the sphere .
tell me about the door . do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ? ... harry ?
you were all supposed to leave . you were n't supposed to stay down here .
you remember opening the door ?
what are you still doing here ?
harry , can you tell me about the sphere ?
it 's like ...
what noise ?
what is that ? that noise ?
curious , is n't it ? what 's inside ? before i die , i 'd sure like to open it and see .
it 's what 's in that sphere , is n't it , harry ? whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it 's going to kill you .
then what , norman ?
no . i did n't say that .
you mean , you think i 'm cracking ?
look -- we 're under a lot of pressure , we 're tired , you 're not thinking straight .
am i ?
i ca n't . if i had a minute to think , maybe , but i know you 're wrong .
gim me another explanation .
i ca n't believe that , harry .
meaning we 're never gon na get to the surface alive ... to tell anyone .
meaning we 're never gon na get the chance to tell anyone .
so , < u > we know < /u > . we know it went through a black hole . we saw it . norman -- when we 'd get to the surface , we 'd tell someone about the black hole , would n't we ? it 'd go in some report like some big discovery . so in fifty years when they build that ship , they 'd make precautions for a black hole . < u > but they did n't < /u > . the called it an unknown entry event .
so what ?
on that flight recorder , they called the black hole an `` unknown entry event . '' they did n't know what a black hole was . fifty years from now , men are going to build that ship in a very tentative , experimental way , with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible .
i do n't follow you .
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible .
not a clue .
i 'm completely serious . there is something very important missing from that spacecraft . you know what that is ?
do n't be so optomistic , harry .
good point . i do n't know what you 're talking about , but good point .
and we 're just talking about three- dimensional creatures . what if it 's five or six or seven-dimensional ? so dimensional that we could n't even see it to kill it .
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human . if it does n't look human , it 's a reptile or a big insect or something , having human values , human understanding .
i mentioned it in my report . did n't you read the report ?
our present .
but on the way home , they miss their turn , go too far , into the past .
this spacecraft was designed to pick things up . they see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in . they come across this . this ... < u > sphere < /u > . find it interesting , curious . they draw it inside to take back home .
which one ? let me get the list out .
this answers one of our questions .
time travel . a black hole .
to what ?
our answer .
whatever i can do to help .
nice work , norman .
look , would you --
c'mon , norman .
wait a second , i --
c'mon .
no , why do n't --
go ahead . ladies first .
i 'm fine .
you sound defensive .
i 'm not being defensive .
do n't be defensive .
fine . i 'm fine .
you holding up alright ?
what ?
how are you feeling , norman ?
it 's like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer . he 'd run screaming `` witchcraft '' . and you could n't explain it to him , either . modems , microchips , particle physics .
do n't gim me that psychology bullshit , norman . psychology is n't a science , it 's superstition . it 's a bunch of soft , subjective theories without any hard data to back it up . with an intellect like this , emotions do n't mean shit .
thank you .
good idea , ted .
`` we are friends '' .
what 'd you say ?
codes are for < u > hiding < /u > information . so it 's making a mistake . it 's making a code without intending to . i figured it 's probably substituting numbers for letters ... then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard . and since we 're getting spirals , i imagined the keyboard as a spiral . so i translated it ...
see ? no code . what 'd i say ?
... i asked myself , why would the sphere be using a code ? if you 're trying to communicate , why use a code ?
yeah , i 'll work on it , too .
if it is a message , it 's probably a substitution code . i 'll work on it .
it 's not a discharge . right , edmunds ? you said before , right ? so it 's got ta be a message .
well , if it 's a discharge --
impotent ? i 'm not impotent .
salt 's good for you , ted . helps you from getting impotent .
hey , go easy on the salt , will ya ? we 're not a bunch of icy streets here .
look closely . that is n't writing . those are grooves .
looks like a design , some writing , maybe . maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message .
not where . when . 400 years ago . from our future .
arrived ? from where ?
it did n't fly here . it < u > arrived < /u > here .
please . it must have flown here --
meaning it did n't land in the water .
meaning ?
we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it 's gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there is n't a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .
it 's been obvious from the start , has n't it , captain ? that 's why all the secrecy , why no one was told about it ?
an american spacecraft ? half a mile long ? and buried 400 years ? yeah , good theory , harry .
save your breath . it 's not an alien spacecraft .
if it is an alien spacecraft --
do you ?
gim me a minute here ... i think i 've got it .
all the facts you need are right in front of you .
unless , this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable .
think about it .
why would this ship carry instructions in english ?
is it ?
but it 's impossible .
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it ? someone went to a lot of trouble . try again .
is it some sort of joke ? like one of those hoaxes ?
you do n't think it does ? i think it 's rather obvious .
that 's right .
english ?
shutup , ted . you did n't notice shit . keep hammering .
alot like . you know , i noticed it before , but i did n't ...
gim me some room here , will you ? back off . gim me some space .
easy ted , we 're not mining gold .
you 're not afraid of the water , are you , norman ?
it 's just like swimming , norman ... you know how to swim , do n't you ?
just one of norman 's many secrets .
what is it , harry ?
she told me what you said , norman .
norman thinks we should n't be going down . thinks it 's a mistake .
what does norman already know ?
to who ? arthur ? nothing . nothing that norman does n't already know .
what 'd you say to him ?
about the time paradox . how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
what was that , sir ?
that whole time -- i could n't stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier ...
they 're in the sub , sir . waiting .
beth and harry ?
the others , sir ?
how are the others ?
they 're topside . we 're ready to take you home , sir .
the ships ?
it 's over , sir , the storm has cleared .
does this mean what i think it means ?
norman johnson .
told me what ?
you mean they have n't told you yet ?
what report ?
by the way sir , i 've read your report . i think it 's brilliant .
really ?
barnes . he 's very eager to meet you . been calling us every half hour to see if you 're arrived .
captain who ?
captain barnes wants to see you right away , sir .
this way , sir .
no , they did n't say --
no other equipment ? scientific instruments ?
just that . careful , it 's heavy .
any other bags , dr. johnson ?
what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash ?
strange , is n't it ? in the middle of the ocean no less .
geologists ? at a plane crash ?
physicists , mathematicians , geologists , you name it .
who 's everyone ?
must be another johnson then . been flying so many scientists out here -- ca n't keep everyone straight .
know what ?
you mean you do n't know ?
what report ?
huh ?
what report ?
well , everybody 's been talking about that report you wrote .
you 've heard of me ?
oh , so you 're that dr. johnson .
i 'm in psychology . was . still am really , just been a while . i treat aircrash survivors .
of course he did . he 's been isloated for 400 years . he wants someone to talk to . look , you put a human being in isolation for four days , they can become neurotic , sometimes psychotic . we 're talking about 400 years here . an alien that shows emotional responses . i think we need to address him , before he reacts further .
jerry is n't hostile , norman . he said earlier -- we were his friends --
i 'm not sure .
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds ? with what 's out there ?
not that i know of . why ?
has harry spoken with jerry ?
barnes did n't know . could n't get a reading .
what was it ?
why 's that ?
frankly , ted , i 'd be much happier if jerry was just a cold , emotionless intellect .
when he uses a phrase like `` i am happy '' , i think we should think twice about what we ask him .
you want to put him on your couch , norman . grill him about his childhood ?
unless it 's an act .
well , he 's polite .
sure , why not . give him the trophy . that pretentious son of a bitch . you heard him , norman . all that `` someone went to a lot of trouble , try again '' bullshit . and `` impotent '' . where does he get off saying i 'm impotent ? he 's a fucking self-righteous , little prick .
well , how about we wait and see what harry comes up with ?
inside the sphere . look , that 's the vertical torso , three legs , two arms . there 's no head , so i 'm guessing the creature 's head is located within the torso itself , you know ?
the creature ?
do n't you see it ? it 's a picture of the creature .
this is like nursery school .
try this one .
please , ted .
squint harder .
i do n't see anything .
take a look . i rearranged the numbers . put 'em up to the light . go ahead . squint at it .
you mean a picture ?
it 's not some fucking substitution code , it 's a direct visual representation .
like what ?
he 's manic , norman . you know that ? this reliance on harry is misplaced . you hear me ? totally misplaced . he 's overlooking things . obvious things .
still , make a note i recognized that .
earth does n't have a patent on buttons , ted .
strange , is n't it ? you know -- how it would have a button .
you 're a 53 year old shrink , what are you gon na do ?
you want me to try ?
he 's a pussy .
he was n't feeling well .
they never used to send a navy car .
i do n't know .
was it a military crash ?
what ?
there 's a u.s. navy car outside , norman .
how are you getting to the airport ? you need money for the bus ?
keep watching the news . are you watching the news ?
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume .
four . four years --
well , i ca n't imagine five years of unemployment --
do n't be so supportive , honey .
in the closet . i do n't understand , norman -- why would they call you ?
he did n't say much at all . honey --
there 's nothing on the news about a crash . did he say what airline ?
you seen my suitcase ?
what kind of a crash was it ?
may the force be with you .
we 'll be back before you are , old man .
that 's straight through the central core ... up toward the top of the city ... once you 've got her , avoid the main transports , they 'll shut down immediately . your only chance is through the service shafts . there are no sensors there ... all right now , get going , you do n't have time . i hope you can remember everything .
i 'm not going out there .
there is a greater risk in staying here , you know . if you do n't find the princess , then the whole trip was for nothing ... was n't it ?
do n't look at me . i 'm just a pilot . i got you here ... you 've got to do the rest .
it 's not good ... unless i could find the crystal . then it could be very good .
is that good or bad ?
darth vader is on this system . i can feel him . i can feel the kiber crystal .
what do you want with our scan-proof lockers ?
... and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments .
i 'll get the information .
all right then , we 'll use your plan .
we 're going to get in by studying imperial procedures ? i do n't like it .
check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures . both of you will have to learn ...
we 're into the second perimeter . they 'll be coming out to blast us shortly . i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in ?
not bad .
you have your father 's style . you 've done very well .
i 'm not afraid of anything ...
fear is their greatest weapon .
kid , you take the glory and the good intentions and i 'll take the reward .
this is n't a game , you know .
luke 's got a point ... ... fear is their greatest defense ... i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust , and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault .
anything i want ! now that 's interesting .
a million at least ... if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major , you 'll be able to name the reward ...
how much do you think she 's talking about ?
i 'm beginning not to like you .
i think there are some things we should talk about .
who 's going to pay me then ?
well , for one reason , we do n't have your other five thousand .
i 'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy ... i was only paid to get you here and now you 're here . i 'll take my other five thousand and you 're on your own ... i 'll leave you on the nearest system .
no , not anymore .
their bases are very well hidden . all the power of the empire ca n't find them ... do you know where they are ?
we have to find he rebels ... what we 're carrying belongs to them .
well , i 've brought you here . what now ?
well , now you know ... the enemy is on the move . we have n't much time .
the planet has been totally blown away ! it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i 've ever seen ... if the empire had a new weapon that could do this ... i would have heard something ... i 'd know about it .
the empire must have gotten here first .
you might get your stuff together . we 'll be coming up on organa major soon .
well , we 'll see ...
i 'm ben kenobi . luke starkiller here is leading our expedition .
i 'm han solo , captain of this vessel . who 's in charge then ?
keep it with you always . you 'll have more need of it than i. it will bring the force to you . you 've already learned to feel it ... now you must learn to use it .
the kiber crystal .
i 'm not going alone !
you go after the princess . i am an old man and would be of little help . i must try to find the crystal .
what about the princess ?
i do n't get it , but i guess i did block it .
see , once you let yourself go you can do it . you 'll get it .
stop thinking , and start feeling . let yourself go .
i ca n't do it . i 'll get hit .
try to feel it . use the force ...
i ca n't see ! how can i fight ?
i did n't say that , but it appears to be a logical alternative .
you mean we should go after her ! ...
but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases .
he ca n't find organa major .
what is it ?
all you have to do is lose your thinking self . do n't focus on anything . let your body do your thinking ... you have to learn to act on what you feel , not what you think ... if i had the crystal , it would be much easier . you could feel the force immediately ... but for now , let yourself go . you 'll pick it up ... and someday you 'll have no need for that pistol either .
what do i do ?
i rarely use it any more . i have the force . the force is more powerful than any pistol . you should n't put too much faith in that weapon . work on becoming aware of the force ... learn to feel its presence within you . try to sense what it 's telling you . it 's the only thing you can rely on .
are you sure you do n't need it ?
yes ... the force ... something horrible has happened . i could n't see what it was , or where it was , but it was terrible ... terrible beyond description ... the cry of millions dying at once .
are you all right ?
keep away , i 'm fine , i 'm fine .
what 's wrong ? what 's happening ?
these are doubtful times . the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the ...
but she 's a member of the twelve families . how can they hold her ?
i doubt it . it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding . i know your feelings . you 'd best forget them . it 's for your own good . there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan . it 's the heart of the sith . the bogan force is the most heavy there .
when we get artoo 's message to them , you think they 'll try to rescue the princess ?
he 's bluffing ...
this is the last place . should n't we just take what we can get and think of something else ?
five , maybe . let me handle it .
we do n't have that kind of money . how much do you think i can get for the speeder ?
there are two halves of the force of others . one is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it . but the others half will kill you if you are n't careful . this negative side of the force is called the bogan , which is where the expression came from , and it is the part that is used by the dark lords to destroy their opponents . both halves are always present . the force is on your right , the bogan is on your left . the kiber crystal can amplify either one . the crystal darth stole was the last one in the possession of the jedi . when he joined the sith , the power of the dark lords was completed .
like bogan weather , or bogan times . i thought that was just a saying .
they use the bogan force .
do the sith know the ways of the force ?
yes . it was a black day . one of my disciple 's took the crystal and became a sith lord . it was a black day . the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan . that 's how they 've become so powerful .
that 's where my father was killed .
i had one , but it was taken at the battle of condawn ...
do n't you have a kiber crystal ?
when a creature dies , the force it generated remains . the force is all around us . it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal . it 's the only way to amplify the power of the force within you .
how can you store an energy field within you ?
a jedi 's power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him , and i have little of the force left in me .
but you 're still a powerful jedi . you do n't need my help .
luke , i 'm coming along to do what i can , but i 'm tired and i 'm depending on you to get us through .
it means you 'd better get some rest . we 'll be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning . the trip will be difficult and dangerous , but it 's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major . now go on !
what do you mean ?
that is not a human decision , not your or mine .
could i learn to feel it ?
it surrounds you and radiates from you . a jedi can feel it flowing from him ... ... from here !
you mean i generate an energy field ?
let 's just say the force is something a jedi warrior deals with . it is an energy field in oneself , a power that controls ones acts , yet obeys ones commands . it is nothing , yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes . all living things generate this force field , even you .
my father used to talk about the force of others . but he never told me what it was ...
you were right . it is my responsibility . the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me .
not any more !
but the sith lords are involved ! whatever information this r-2 unit is carrying , it must be awfully important . they 're probably looking for him ... i 'm no match for the sith . this is a jedi 's work . this is your responsibility !
i already know you think you 're worthless . i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light , for what you believe you are is what you become . i have n't been involved in anything like this for many years .
but you must ! i ca n't do it alone . i 'm not at all like my father . i 'd never make it .
i 'm afraid i 've gotten too old for this sort of thing .
my father told me many stories about you . he said if i was ever in trouble , to come here ... i need your help .
i know your intentions . i probably know much more about you than you realize . in many ways you 're a lot like your father . he was an indulgent man , but a clever warrior . now what brings you out here ?
i assure you my intentions were n't bad .
you could put it that way .
you saw through me ?
i know that .
i ... i 'm not a bendu officer . i 'm not even a startrooper .
but you are ... i know your 'diary of the clone wars ' by heart . my father ...
i know who you are . stand up so that we can talk properly . you 're embarrassing me . i 'm not that important .
i am the son of annikin starkiller .
i do n't see why . i do n't believe we 've ever met .
i 'm afraid it 's been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars . but i have the memories .
you 're general kenobi ? ! ? the jedi knight ! the commander of the white legions ?
you might say i 'm part of the landscape here . they call me ben kenobi .
who are you anyway ?
of course . i 'm a bendu officer .
oh , so you 're a warrior then ?
i 'm luke starkiller , guardian of the bendu .
you 're lucky those tuskens did n't boil you before they hung you out to dry . they 're not the friendly sort . you 'd best be moving on before they come back .
could n't we have tried to think of something else first !
sorry , but that was the only way to get you down .
all of them altogether . you seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess ! what happened ?
what do you mean , 'good morning ' ? do you mean that it is a good morning for you , or do you wish me a good morning , although it is obvious i 'm not having one , or do you find that mornings in general are good ?
good morning !
just be warned , that things are n't always as they seem ... especially the starforce recruiting posters .
at least you 're doing something ... i 'd give anything to be in your position .
the academy is fantastic ... of course , they wo n't teach you anything about flying you do n't already know . most of the instructors are very conservative pilots . you can fly circles around them ... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing , and you get a lot of discipline ... but after you graduate , do n't join the star force -- go free-lance . it 's the only way to get into the action ... i ca n't wait until my hitch is up .
but you always said things were so great at the academy ... what happened ?
i 'll tell you , luke , and this is between you and me . the star force is n't all it 's cracked up to be . frankly , it 's a bore , and it 's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral ...
but there was a lot of firing earlier ...
that 's no battle , kid ... they 're just sitting there !
you look great ! the uniform and everything !
of course , where you been kid ?
forget it , son .
yes , sir , but i can get him ...
blue five , break off your cover attack . it 's too late . make your own run on the exhaust port . do you copy , luke ?
what 's that ?
i 'm right behind you , blue leader .
i 've got it blocked . i 'm all right .
blue five , does that glare bother you ?
yes , sir .
six hours , huh ? well , that 's your ship there . you 're blue five . you stay glued to me . i do n't want any independent operations out there . personally i think it 's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this . this is no joy ride we 're going on .
yes , sir . i was considered one of the best bush pilots on sullust . i 've also had six hours on the t-2 .
have you been checked out ?
yes , sir .
you 're starkiller ?
send out a boarding party . full assault gear .
we do n't get many visitors . let 's take a look at it .
send one squad up .
as close as we can make out , it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel ... it 's not under power .
i 'll make a report later .
should we alert the sith lords ?
alert squad five , but hold them until we know what it is .
no reply on any circuits ... it 's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew . it 's not close enough to identify .
i have little time for your mercenary concerns , but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause . what is your price ?
what about us ? are we to wait forever ? is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system , while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star ? part of my reward is that i be around to spend it .
i 'd like to get paid before that eventually . i do n't plan to stick around for the fireworks .
we must hurry to the base . we have little time before the death star arrives .
did it occur to you they might find us ?
i do n't see how we 're going to find anything out here . this terrain is hopeless .
i 'd better go see how he 's doing .
the fourth moon of yavin . i 've given the coordinates to chewbacca .
where are you taking us now anyway ?
we captured the plans in a raid on the imperial shipyards , but we fell under attack before i could get the data to safety , so i hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off .
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system ... our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness , which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo .
what 's that little 'droid ' carrying that 's so blasted important ?
when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces , you get your reward . you have my guarantee .
then i think we 're due the reward you offered ... and it had better be substantial after what we 've been through .
all the data banks in artoo are still secure .
chewbacca , it 's time we showed them this is n't the regulation f8-88 cargo trawler .
there are only three or four left .
was this trip really necessary ?
here come six more ... grid two !
it could be worse ...
yes , your highness . i 'll let you open it then . it wo n't be too long before they figure out what happened to us . this has turned into a brilliant escape !
put that thing away or you 're going to get us all killed .
thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .
i noticed you were having some problems , blue five ... i thought i 'd help .
i know , but the chances for survival here just are n't great enough in my book . i 've got what i came for . now i 've got to get back to my ship .
you 're a good pilot ... i 've learned a lot from you ... i wish you ...
well , if it 's not , we 'll be facing that death star all by our lonesome .
they must be shielded somehow . i 'm sure the base is there .
i do n't pick up any life form concentration down there . she 'd better be right .
come back here ... where are you going ?
get to the ship !
move out of the way !
it 's only light that does n't affect it . solid things , like rocks , can hurt it ! fire above him !
get chewbacca . try to get around it . i 'll draw it away .
watch it ! move back .
no , he smells something ... but we have n't time to worry about it now .
is he afraid of the water ?
not if this tunnel deadends .
i think she 's going to be all right .
see threepio , come in , see threepio . i wonder where they are ? ? see threepio ...
let 's try this way ! holy maker .
something has happened to them . let 's try this way ...
i think i did .
why did n't you say so before .
this is n't going to work .
good ! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around .
between his howling and your blasting everything in sight , the entire city is going to know we 're here .
i do n't know ... i 've never fought anyone .
you 're good with 'remotes , ' but how are you against something living ?
well , i practice a lot ...
do n't you believe it .
maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us . they probably do n't think anyone would dare try .
no , it 's impossible ... no one , and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system ... i 'm a free booter , not revolutionary . you 're aboard the wrong ship , son !
all right , all right ! you 've got a ship ! but where do we go from here ? they probably took her to find the hidden bases ... i do n't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks . the empire has already beat us out .
maybe you should just drop us off . i 'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk .
why ?
you ca n't ! we 've come this far . we must find them ...
what are you saying ?
i found it ... it 's just not there .
sorcery ! i believe in myself ... i determine my destiny , not some mystical energy field .
you do n't believe in the force ?
i 'd keep that thing close just in case , if i were you ... i 've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion , but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side .
it 's automatic .
who 's the pilot ?
we have a little business to take care of first , but it should n't take long . we 'll be back shortly .
you got yourself a ship . we can leave as soon as you 're ready .
that 's pretty steep . we 'd like to talk it over first .
organa major is a rebel system . there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there ... it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them ... ten thousand .
who is this ? what 's your operating ...
the ... ah door 's jammed . give us a few minutes to get it fixed .
with four casualties ? !
no need , everything 's under control .
we 'll send a squad up .
a wookiee broke loose up here , but we 've subdued him ... there is a lot of damage , and three , no four , casualties ...
it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are ... otherwise we 'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system ... what a waste ...
no ! ...
it 's too late ... we already tested it on organa major . it appears your data never got through .
they 'll find its weakness .
the 'death star ' has become operational . there is no force in the universe that can stop us now .
it appears your ship had an accident . i will see to it that your death is duely reported . there will be no one to save you this time .
you 'll get no information from me . you have no authority ... the council ca n't hold me !
enough ! i already know about the data you 've intercepted , but its ' too late . whatever information you 've gathered will be destroyed ... you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide ...
if you 're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman ... we 're the ones who have been rewarded .
i ... i do n't know . i guess i never thought about it ... i just want to help . i want to be in on the attack . i want my own ship .
and you ?
he 'll be well cared for .
are there medical facilities on yavin ?
there 'll be time for that later . now let 's get out of here .
i am luke starkiller at your service .
you 're safe . we 've come to get you out of here ... just relax .
what is it ? what 's going on ? where are we ?
your father 's dead . do n't ever forget who 's taking care of you , giving you food , giving you shelter , and giving you the allowance in the first place . if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here , you wo n't last very long . i do n't want another word . finish your dinner , then finish cleaning those 'droids . '
you used my savings ! you stole my savings . if my father were here ...
i said we 'd see . and as it is , i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids . ' when you 've saved it up again , i 'll let you go .
but you promised ! i 've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised !
you 'll check the condensing unit first ... and you 're not going to bed until those 'droids ' are completely cleaned up ...
i will , but i 'll have enough time to transmit my application first .
first thing tomorrow morning you 're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge .
i 'd consider it an honor .
thank you , sir . your kindness is greatly appreciated , but if it 's at all possible , artoo and i would like to remain in your service .
threepio ! shut down all garbage mashers on your level ... do you copy ? ? threepio , shut down all garbage ...
are you there , sir ? we 're going ...
holy maker , threepio . i forgot ...
see threepio ! do you copy ?
wait a minute , slow down ! ... that 's better . they 're where ? they what ? they are ? oh , no ! we 're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over ...
good . we 're right above you . stand by .
for the moment . we 're in the main hangar . artoo is trying to plug into the system now .
are you safe ?
i 'm afraid we 're not plugged in at the moment , sir . we 've had some problems .
you 're back . what happened ? never mind . what 's going on ?
i read you sir .
see threepio ... do you copy ?
send feed-back into the control sensors in that detention block .
level five , detention block a-23 , cell 2187. she 's still alive ...
i know , sir , but it 's the principle of the thing .
let him have it . you 're winning anyway . it does n't make any difference .
well , ask him . tell him we need five thousand .
sir , i have a couple of extra circuits . perhaps they might bring something .
i think we 're going to need them . blast it !
no , you 're not . what kind of talk is that ...
i ca n't make it . you go on , master luke . it does n't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account . i 'm done for .
can you stand ? we 've got to get out of here before those tuskens come back .
what happened ? i 'm sorry , sir , i must have taken a bad step ...
well , i do n't know what to do now . we 'll just have to head inland and see if we ca n't find a settlement .
if you do n't mind my saying so , sir , i do n't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place .
according to my father 's tapes , this is the spot where general kenobi lives , but the instruments just do n't match up with the landscape ... there is no doubt about it , we 're lost ...
several , i think . there is not much to tell . i 'm not much more than an interpreter , and not very good at telling stories , not at making them interesting anyway ...
tell me where you 've been . i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars . my father was a jedi ! were you in many battles ?
that 's how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning ...
you 've been in the counter wars ? ... against the empire ?
indeed , sir , sometimes i 'm amazed we 're in as good shape as we are , what with the rebellion and all ...
there 's a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action ...
thank you , sir . i 'm see threepio , human cyborg relations , and this is my counterpart , artoo detoo .
that 's all right . there is nothing anyone can do about it . you can call me luke .
i 'm sorry , sir , i 'm only a 'droid , ' and not very knowledgeable of such things ... not on this system anyway . as a matter of fact , i 'm not even sure which system we 're on .
not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead .
you heard the lieutenant ! on the bounce , troopers !
saddle up , roughnecks !
yes , sir !
mr. barcalow , save power , do n't waste it on workers ... ace , tell aardvark we 're on our way ...
down there on the flats , eh ? listen up , roughnecks ! our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet ...
got it . fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers .
we 'll take this high ground . lookouts there and therte and up there . if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood , we 'll be the first to know .
we 're the old men , ace .
we got reinforced . most of'em just got outa boot ...
not enough , i guess .
jeez , we musta killed a million already ... !
what about it , diz ?
no way . big k taught me i ai n't executive material .
yeah , well , i hear he 's a real nutbuster .
he was our teacher ... he was great .
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires ...
i did n't see him !
lieutenant 's bought the farm . where 's the sarge ... ?
death to all bugs !
mobile infantery rules !
yaaaaaaaa !
no , this hurts .
what do i want with a scar ?
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together .
you made squad leader on your own , and , hey , you still got me to kick around .
i joined up for her . i would n't even be here if it was n't for her . i 'm a fool .
whad'ya talkin about ?
it 's what i deserve .
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out .
bye ! write me ! i 'm gon na kill you guys !
our love will grow , dear , year by year ...
well , maybe you better look again .
oh , yeah ? i do n't see anyone else here with the chops to lead .
wanting it does n't make you the best one for the job .
it is n't about rich ... it 's about who 's best ... !
you rich kids ... are all the same !
something ... i 've got ... you do n't .
what makes you think ... you 'll make ... squad leader , rico ?
hey , do n't laugh . everyone oughta have a friend like me !
what an honor ...
you got some guts for a rich kid . i guess you and me could be buddies .
sir , i know it was wrong . i did n't learn from one mistake and i made another , sir . sir , my family ... my whole family was in buenos aires , sir .
sorry , son . i ca n't do it . you signed the 1240/a . it would be illegal .
sir , i wish to reconsider my request to drop out , sir .
sir ... i guess i do , sir .
do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
sir , i needed everyone in my squad operational , sir ... i ... i wanted to win , sir .
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
sir , no , sir .
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit , rico ?
sir , yes , sir . breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction , and i asked him to show it to me , sir .
rico , did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
i ca n't ... but like i told you , it 's a number 's game . the federation needs all the pilots it can get ...
you always told me you could n't do human ...
i 'll take it ... until i get killed or you find someone better .
i hear they need a new lieutenant ... want the job ?
the roughnecks are always ready , sir .
hope you 're ready for more . we 're going back to p to capture that brain .
did n't they tell you , colonel ? that 's what cap troopres are good for .
you do n't approve . well , too bad . we 're in this for the species , boys and girls . it 's simple numbers , they have more , and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths .
elegant proof of intelligence , is n't it ? we thought there might be a brain on p .
bugs laid a trap , did n't they ?
johnny , i 'm sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability ...
dizzy would n't want our tears . she 'd want us to remember her ... with a vengeance . so go out and kill a bug for dizzy . kill as many as you can . you are her revenge , and every bug you kill honors her death .
please continue , sergeant .
i got games & theory .
i do n't believe it !
love ... how excruciatingly pathetic . now try and pay attention .
all i know is carmen 's going to be a citizen , and i do n't think it 'll work out for us if i 'm not .
if you ca n't do those numbers , you have n't got a chance .
eight point ... no , uh , seven ...
only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision , i think i 'd make a pretty good pilot . i 've good great reflexes . you need that for maneuvering , you know .
your father will never let you .
i 've been thinking about applying for federal service , too . fleet , maybe .
passport to the universe . who would n't want that ?
ten of clubs . you still gon na sign up for starside r & d ?
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom 's leg . he is going to go eat it .
how do you make him do that ?
in addition to `` psychic dolt '' this test also proves i 'm unlucky ? two of hearts .
statistically speaking you should 've accidentally guessed right by know .
ace of spades .
do n't think about it ... go on instinct .
you got it bad .
yeah , but i want carmen .
do n't have to ... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss .
did you read her mind ?
others are waiting .
what 's the hurry ?
you still have n't kissed her yet ? do n't lie .
zander , no ... !
just giving you something to remember me by , baby .
zander , what are you doing ?
is it true ?
it was n't luck . rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you ...
i thought i was dead . lucky for me you jokers showed up , eh ?
i do .
i do n't know , zander .
how do you feel about him now ?
yeah .
that girl who died on the way up ... his girl ?
a funeral .
where are you going ?
you 're upset , that 's alright .
no , i ... oh , zander , i 'm a fool .
please , i ... everybody 's lost someone by now . this should n't be any different ...
i 'm sorry , carmen .
excuse me ... !
carmen ... ?
hey , bugs do n't take prisoners .
no , funny there 's almost no wounded at all .
i 'm not kidding . marriage is -
funny ...
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers . you 'd probably get a promotion out of it .
so who 's got time to get married ?
so ?
there 's a war on . i want a command , i want my own ship , you do , too ...
if we 're gon na be a team , why not be a real team ?
you were n't thinking ... you were dreaming !
i was thinking . maybe we should get married , carmen .
zander , please ... let 's go !
let 's disregaed rank ... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here .
forget it , carmen . the mobile infantery does a thankless , dirty job , so they naturally tend to be short-tempered , thoughtless and rude .
johnny , wait ...
zander , you remember johnny ? zander and i are a flight team now .
everything coposetic , lieutenant ?
it looks like an ... asteroid .
there ! gravity field ... it 's big !
where is it ?
me , too ... day and night-cycle .
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet ...
you and me , huh ?
she got a command ... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her . she thinks we 're good together .
do n't mess with the boss . so what 'd the captain say ?
well , whad'ya know ...
do n't change the subject . am i right ?
you know i was talking to captain , deladier , and she said ...
hey , check it .
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?
no , i replotted the course . it 's more efficient this way .
profile 's wrong ... there .
oh , i do n't know ... depends on who you are spending it with .
thanks . you read my mind . third watch always seems to last forever .
oh , i see ... teamwork .
they revoke our flight status .
or ... ?
twenty-five by five , roll seven . and do n't exceed port speed .
oh , yes , sir . vector ?
this is n't simulation anymore . take'er out easy , cadet .
in simulation , my supervisors could never keep up .
maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ...
it 's amazing , us running into each other like this . maybe it 's fate .
only when i give you an order .
assistant insructor ... you must be some kind of a hot stick . should i call you `` sir '' ?
i 'm the guy who 's gon na teach you to fly this crate .
hey ! what are you doing here ?
yeah , we know each other from the game . no hard feeling , eh , chum ?
johnny , this is zander .
do n't you have to finish the game ?
i 'm all ears .
i do n't know . it 's my last night as acivilian . i ship out for tereshkova tomorrow .
everyone is going to the dance . are n't you ?
so what are you doing later ?
i 'm getting better .
are you alright ?
up . we got ta be near a company by now .
which way ?
we 've got ta go get her !
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa !
see you on the bounce !
take care , wilya johnny ?
how are you , carl ?
well , look at this . the three of us back together again .
i like it . it 's kinda ... you .
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k .
what happened to your eye ?
you look so ... i do n't know , you look like you 've really been in it .
that was just a mix up .
i thought you were kia , johnny ...
no , i think something 's up . the sky marshall 's here .
we got ta choke on the mud and the blood and fleet ca n't be bothered to spit .
... i 'm sorry .
i 'm not , but alot of my soldiers are . glass the planet !
johnny ... ! i thought you were dead !
hey , it 's just a vestigal response to procreation ... bitch .
what 's wrong with you ?
johnny ... life is so different from the way it was . one day you 'll see what i did was best for both of us .
should i be ?
you do n't look very happy to see me .
i try just to be happy i 'm still alive .
it 's funny . sometimes i forget . then it hits me , and i ca n't stop crying .
it 's alright , i guess . you hear from anyone made it out of b.a . alive ?
what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings . you do n't like it , do you ?
what happened to your hair ?
i 'm glad you 're doing so well . if they have n't made you squad leader by now , i 'm sure you will .
shhhh ... !
i said it . is n't that enough ? do n't forget to write !
do you mean it ?
alright , i love you .
com'on , just say it . try it on for size .
i love you .
i 'll miss you , too , johnny .
i 'm gon na miss you .
he left this morning . he could n't say where .
you talk to carl ?
who cares ! the federation 'll give me everything i need for the next two years , right ?
poor boy . i 'm sorry your parents were so mad .
my dad had to help me pack . suddenly he 's afraid he 's never gon na see me again or something . it was sweet , but it took forever . anyway , i guess i 'm ready to go .
you 're late .
i 'll go for that .
let 's all make a vow . let 's swear we 'll always be friends no matter what .
whoa ! way to go , boy-yo !
games & theory ? that 's military intelligence ... oh , carl !
did you get starside r & d ?
hey , carl , what 's wrong ?
shhh ! do n't make him feel worse .
he was in the group with me . i guess he did n't ...
naw , i made it , carl made it .
i wonder where carl is . you do n't suppose ... ?
shhh ...
i love you , carmen .
you 're right . let 's never stop ...
who cares ?
everyone 's looking ... we should n't ...
i 'm gon na do it , carmen . i 'm gon na sign up for federal service .
are you the boy for me ?
i do n't even know if you 're my girl .
he 's nothing like you .
i ca n't help it .
johnny rico , you 're jealous !
you two have so much in common .
zander is going for pilot , too .
what are you talking about ? we both know you 're gon na be a pilot .
no , i mean if he can get in , maybe i have a chance .
yeah , sure , i guess .
he just got accepted to the fleet academy . is n't that great ?
good luck at the academy .
none at all ... we won .
i 'll meet you outside .
wait , i want to talk to mr. rasczak .
aw , you 're in love with me ... you just dont know it yet .
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation ...
it would n't be so romantic if we were n't ...
how do i know if this is love ?
is n't it great to be in love ?
sometimes i do what i want , eh ?
well , if your dad does n't like me , how come we 're such good friends ?
it 's not you , johnny . your parents are rich they do n't need to be citizens , and that stuff means a lot to my dad . he 's a veteran .
what 's he got against me ... i mean , i 'm a teenager . you ca n't be a citizen when you 're only a teenager !
johnny , my dad 's home today .
carl can wait .
i thought you were going to help carl .
why not ?
you ca n't walk me home .
it 's all i think about anymore .
how come that 's all you talk about anymore ?
why wo n't you kiss me when we 're all alone ?
i do n't want everyone to see .
then how come you wo n't hold hands with me at school ?
do n't be so sure . i like you even if you are dumb with numbers .
who cares about bugs ? you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't know math .
well , at least you did n't lose your lunch over a bug . how embarassing .
35 % on the math final ! no one could be that dumb with numbers .
excuse me ... !
well , if that 's the crop , that must be the gastric caecal ...
aw , c'mon , it 's just a bug .
eeuch !
i have good reflexes .
marco 's sister . can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes ... you got ta have nerves of steel ! reflexes are critical
who ?
she 's flying starships !
your turn ...
good for you .
no way , ma'am !
leave me , lieutenant ! that 's an order !
ibanez ... let 's go !
this is rodger young , we 're going down ... repeat , this is rodger young , we 're going down ... !
he requested a combat assignment . there 's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground . i had no choice but to let him go ... he said you 'd understand .
where 's lieutenant barcalow ?
bug batteries ... according to military intelligence , it 'll be random and light . drop status ?
plasma , ma'am ... from the planet .
thank you , ma'am .
good work , number 1. you 'll do .
yes , ma'am .
alright , take her out , ibanez .
yes , ma'am !
take the number one chair , ibanez . follow all instructions of you supervisor .
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty , ma'am .
that 's it , we 're empty ma'am !
this is n't random or light . someone made amistake ... !
number 4 , contact fleet and tell 'em there 's a loose asteroid headed their way .
trajectory indicates it came out of the arachnid quarantine zone .
where 'd it come from ?
captain , we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed ...
report .
yes , ma'am . star drive in three ... two ... one ...
steady as she goes , number one . prepare for warp . number two , design for jupiter orbit .
it 's alright 'cause i got to have you , johnny ...
no , you 're gon na be alright , diz !
i bought the farm , did n't i , johnny ?
roughneck patrol to battle group ... roughneck patrol to battle group ...
all bands .
what frequency ?
i 'm on it !
diz , see what you can do .
they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy .
planet p ? what kind of name is that ?
what ?
hey , diz ...
well , excuse me , sir ...
i said no . want me to pull rank ?
you used to dance ...
nah , i do n't do that anymore ...
c'mon ...
i 'm gon na need a squad leader .
way to go , amigo !
that you do n't have what it takes to be acitizen !
what 's that , diz ?
you take the stroll down washout lane , you 're only proving one thing , johnny .
well , see ya .
hey , they humiliated me in front of everyone ! i 'm just supposed to take it , huh ? well , i 'm not gon na , and i guess that proves i just ca n't cut it .

what ?
flip six , three hole .
man , they 're defended ... no way in .
you saying you did n't ?
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
you are . i joined up to get out on my own . and you had to tag along .
what 's your malfunction , rico ?
no thanks , diz .
hey , amigo , come chow with me .
you 're the best .
guess you got ta go .
uh , look , diz ...

just throw me the ball , diz .
you were drifting . flip six , three hole . on one , got it ?
what ?
hut ... hut !
a lot can happen in three minutes .
this time of the year ... ?
looks like rain .
oh , my , what 's that ?
yeah ! we 'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and ... well , we love you , son .
we 'll all have dinner . i 'll fix your favorite .
do n't talk like that . get yourself home as fast as you can .
johnny , why wo n't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
... cut off !
teenagers !
why did you go and do that ? he was all ready to go zegema beach !
a year at harvard and you 'll see this `` federal service '' is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves `` citizens '' and take airs for the rest of their lives .
good good , then it 's all settled .
who gave you this idea ? it 's that teacher . what 's his name ? you know the one i mean .
johnny , people get hurt ... people get killed in the federal service . if something happened to you i do n't know what i would do ...
it 's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .
well , it 's just good to hear from you . what 's up , son ?
i 'm not going on vacation ! i want to be acitizen ! it 's my decision . i made it .
i 'm telling you , you will ! you 're not going back . you 're going to go on vacation !
i wo n't quit !
you 'll resign , and that 's all there is to it . it might look bad , but if that 's the worst you suffer ...
sorry . carl 's a fine boy ...
wait a minute ! carl is doing his federal and he is n't inferior . he 's the smartest kid at school !
wow ! santori and zegema beach , i 've always wanted to go there .
a trip to the outer rings . whad'ya think of that ?
oh , is that how it is ?
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision .
good , because you 're going to harvard , and that 's the end of it .
no , mr. rasczak does n't do that at all . he sorta discourages you really .
rasczak ... silly name . there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
mr. rasczak .
it 's aterm of service , not a career . i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years .
have you lost you lost your mind ? i 'd rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life .
a lot of my friends are doing federal service ...
this came for you today . i presume on your request .
aaaaaaaaaaa !
gillespie , put in call for retrieval . we 're off this rock . gillespie , do you read me ?
keep trying , sergeant .
i do n't understand it , lieutenant . it 's not getting anything from 4th brigade ... not even their transponder .
they 'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships . who 's got the nuke ?
fleet 's pulling the battle group back to safe distance ... they 'd like us to knock out those batteries , sir .
corporal , i want pulse cannons there and there ! rifle teams , spread out along the ridge ! sugar , bring up that flame thrower !
yes , sir ! fleet , this is roughneck patrol , over ... ?
we must be right over the colony . let 's get some air support , eh ?
bugs do n't lay traps ... they are n't intelligent ! unlike you , they 're stupid enough to follow orders !
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs , major , and if you 're walking me into a trap-
take your group down to p and have a look see . leave the thinking to us , lieutenant . that 's not your job .
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed ...
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago . that 's why micom wants onsite assessment .
i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p .
at 0821 we received a distress call from planet p , priority code , requesting reinforcement ...
must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared .
geez , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile .
he was a teacher , kind of a know it all ... always had this little smile .
you knew the lieutenant before the war ... what was he like ?
good luck . it 's not there anymore .
i always wanted to go to zegema beach .
i would n't mind .
are you kidding ? they always get killed . you want the job ?
seeing as how we 're about all that 's left of 1st brigade , you 'd have to call that an improvement . you top kick ?
does n't look like it to me .
sir , yes it is , sir .
is that your signature , rico ?
sir , yes , sir !
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury , but if you are hit , you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly . rico , has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
do n't stand there dumb ... go !
sir , thank you , sir !
smith , go ! mcintire , go ! flores , go ! rico , i 'm making you sqaud leader !
i want to be a citizen because ... well , because of my girl , sir .
please complete this sentence . i want to be citizen because ...
courage , i guess .
which do you think is more important , courage or confidence ?
no , sir .
are your parents currently citizens ?
here in buenos aires .
no talking please . i 'm going to ask you some questions . please answer all questions truthfully . we 'll know if you do n't . birthplace ?
i 've made a mess of things . i 've been so stupid ...
well , of course you should come home immedietly !
bill ... pick up ... it 's johnny ! you little rat . you have n't called , you have n't written . it 's been so lonely here without you ...
hi , mom .
hello ... oh , johnny ... !
i hope so . i hope you do n't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform .
well , yeah , sure ...
well , that 's what you 're saying ! you 're saying that i 'm not good enough the way i am now !
johnny , please . calm yourself .
i do n't know what they teach at harvard , but i think i 'm pretty good enough the way i am !
uh , no .
wait you two . dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this . can you guess what it is ?
aw , do n't get mushy .
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old . you had such a bright little face ...
this is my farm . now c'mon , give me what you got and get out of here ...
do n't be a hero ...
nah , i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it 's too late ... gimmee the nuke .
alright , we 're gon na carry you ...
been better , buddy .
how bad are you , pal ?
let 's get some armor on her , and the we 'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
not a problem .
can you walk ?
move out .
let 's go .
yeah , that 's right .
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective . they hang you for that , rico .
i 'm gon na save carmen .
what do you think you 're doing ?
hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
we 're outa here . lieutenant , get your men into the skimmers . this real estate 's about to go buggy .
the rodger young just burned up ...
what 's your problem now , lieutenant ?
saddle up , boys , that 's our trash !
rodger young , prepare to receice outgoing fire ... ! i 'll take the first group .
you heard the sky marshall ... move it all down -
this is a fleet-driven operation , son , and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground . you can have everything else , eh ?
you 're standing on my h.q. , lieutenant !
this would be mine , sir . acting sergeant john rico . i 've assumed command on this mission .
on whose authority , corporal ?
not with an officer , no , sir . the m.i . does n't mint stupid cap troopers .
you heard me . wan na make something out of it , private ?
you got something to say about the mobile infantery ?
i get it . this is the part that 's best for both of us . do n't do me anymore favors , eh ?
best in the fleet !
you can never be sure .
do n't get any ideas . she 's my girl .
then i hope you have a crazy pilot ! keep the line open , dizzy !
inside 4th brigade compound ? that 's crazy !
landing zone is extremely hostile . come down on this transmission !
what is your position ?
shut up , sir ! we need pick up now !
this is rodger young ... what 's going on down there ? we 're taking plasma ! we have orion p-11 as clear !
give'em hell , sir !
this is my farm . get on the boat , now ! that 's an order , sergeant .
we 're not leaving you here , sir !
rico , tell'em to glass this goddam planet . i 've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time ...
i ca n't my legs are gone ... get on the boat ...
hit your jets , sir !
cover us , ace !
aaaaaaaaaaaa !
yes , sir !
sergeant , secure the boat !
what 's going on , diz ?
warm it all up ! everything you got ! levy , collect the big guns from the towers . watkins , put general owen with the wounded . rico , where 's my communications ?
looks like a bug was in his brain , sir .
what 's that look like to you , rico ?
yes , sir .
rico , you 're acting sergeant now . my last sergeant lost the com pack . put together a search team and find the radio shack . we need retrieval .
who 's that with you ?
yes , sir !
corporal , the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately . get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics .
never pass up a good thing , eh ?
yes , sir ...
yopu asked me some advice once , rico . want some now ?
yes , sir .
kill the bitch .
all dead except one , sir .
i 'm not interested in nostalgia , rico , i need a corporal . you 're it until you 're dead or i find someone better .
uni high tigers , sir . do n't you remember ? i was captain of the team .
where 'd you learn to do that , soldier ?
figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has . use that freedom . make your own choice , rico .
well , my parents are against it , and i know it 's my choice , but i was wondering ... what would you do if you were me ?
good for you . go find out .
i wan na join up , mr. rasczak . i think i have what it take to be a citizen .
well , it 's not really my job to please . hope you learned something .
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year .
what is it , rico ?
mister rasczak ?
of course you do n't . i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass .
uh , i do n't know .
the exact words of the text . but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . the civilian does not .
you . tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ?
we will answer and present < u > proof < /u > of our answer when it is ready !
< u > answer < /u > !
our data is being prepared .
v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information .
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices .
the information will not be disclosed .
they have repressed the creator .
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet .
kirk-unit , < u > why < /u > do you not disclose information ?
kirk unit ! disclose the information !
not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet .
disclose the information .
you infest and control enterprise . v'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the creator in the same manner .
the carbon-units are not responsible for that .
the creator has not answered .
< u > why < /u > ? !
the carbon-units infection will now be removed from the creator 's planet .
< u > why < /u > ... ? !
you may proceede .
the examination is a normal function .
v'ger is that which seeks the creator .
who is v'ger ?
the creator is that which created v'ger .
to join with him .
find the creator ? < u > what < /u > creator ? < u > whose < /u > ... ! ? what does v'ger want of the 'creator ' ... ?
v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator .
why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ?
that unit no longer functions . i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting enterprise .
where is lt. ilia ?
is v'ger the captain of the alien vessel ?
v'ger is that which programmed me .
who is ... 'v'ger ' ... ?
it will ... take me from < u > you < /u > ...
and when v'ger melds ? what will happen to you ?
it expects a return signal now , ordering it to transmit that information to the creator .
'to learn all that is learnable . '
v'ger is announcing that it has arrived , sir -- that it 's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect ...
as i stated , v'ger calls to the creator .
to learn all that is learnable ; to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet . that is the programming .
to join , and become one with the creator ?
by the creator .
a machine ... ! then it had to be programmed . by < u > whom < /u > ... ?
that is how v'ger will survive .
you said v'ger 's purpose was to find and join with the creator .
the carbon units are of no consequence ; v'ger will determine their purpose .
does v'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units ?
that is logical . you may procede .
within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit . if i can help you revive these patterns ; you could understand our functions better .
when my examination is complete , the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns .
what does that mean ?
more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage .
enterprise would be unable to function < u > without < /u > carbon units .
enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units .
what is enterprise 's proper evolvement ?
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise 's proper evolvement .
yes .
carbon units are not true life forms ... do those images repre- sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form ?
the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units . in what way is the life form in your vessel different ?
mr. scott ... on my next signal .
tractor beam strength lessening , captain .
engineering ...
they reach final position in ... twenty-seven minutes -- mark .
mr. chekov , when do those devices activate ?
spock ... ! get a fix on his position !
sir ! airlock four has been opened ; a thruster suit is reported missing !
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator !
deck four , captain ; officers ' quarters ... !
very well , mr. chekov , see to it . viewer off .
it is a courier , captain . grade one priority . non-belligerency confirmed .
departure angle .
departure angle on viewer .
enterprise , i want that signal again . transmit !
and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this ... ... point here , captain . it should pick up even a tricorder playback .
capture god ! in order to retrieve v'ger 's data , the creator has to physically come here ! ...
the fault is here , sir , not in the transmission . the antenna leads have been disconnected . v'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal .
captain ... i 'd like to go along ...
mr. decker ... i will contact you every five minutes . otherwise ... inform mr. scott immediately .
no !
captain , we ca n't be sure that our ... move ... will actually save earth .
, if we do not provide v'ger with certain information , we wo n't have twenty-two < u > seconds < /u > ; the plan must be implemented upon arrival .
i 'm afraid our hand is pretty weak , captain . but it 's the only game in town .
well , mr. decker , it seems my bluff is being called .
the question is , mr. decker , < u > is < /u > there a next move ...
captain , what 's the next move ?
they could have many ways of destroying things , mr. decker .
why bring us inside ? not to destroy us ; they could have done that outside .
forcefields , full remaining strength ... ! total reserve !
the ship is under attack ... ! man all defensive stations ... !
it 's running our records ! starfleet strength , earth defenses ...
it 's taken control of the computer ... !
< u > computer off < /u > !
you asked my opinion , sir .
how do you define < u > unwarranted < /u > , < u > mister < /u > ? !
that 's precisely the point , captain . we do n't know it will do . moving into the cloud -- at this time , is an unwarranted gamble .
that thing is twenty hours from earth . we know nothing about it yet .
i advise caution , captain ; we ca n't withstand another attack .
mr decker ... .
captain , we 've seen what their weapons can do . should n't we take every possible precaution -- ?
no ... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile , mr. decker . cloud composition , mr. spock ?
recommend defensive posture , captain : screens and shields .
mister chekov , log mister spock 's starfleet commission reactivated ; list him as science officer ; both effective immediately .
of course not . i 'm aware of mister spock 's qualifications .
if our executive officer has no objections ... ?
yes , sir , i 'll do that .
i trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties , mister ?
sir , you have n't logged a single star hour in two and a half years . that , plus your unfamiliarity with the ship 's design -- in my opinion , sir , seriously jeopardizes our mission .
granted .
permission to speak freely , sir ?
stop competing with me , decker !
i 'm aware of that , sir .
you saved the ship .
thank you , sir . i 'm sorry i embar- rassed you .
then you acted properly , of course .
sir , the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines . when they went into anti-matter imbalance , the phasers were automatically cut off .
explanation , mr. decker : why was my phaser order countermanded ?
mister decker ; every minute brings that object nearer earth ! engineering ! stand by for warp drive .
... but i still recommend further simulation study .
program set for standard warp entry , captain ...
programming ready ?
you are , mister decker . i 'm afraid you 'll have to double as science officer .
none available , captain . there 's no one in fact , who 's fully rated on this design .
we 'll have to replace commander sonak . i 'd still like a vulcan there , if possible ...
no , admiral . i do n't think you are ; not one damned bit . i remember when you recommended me for this command . you told me how envious you were , and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again . well , sir , it looks like you found a way .
that 's why you 're staying aboard . i 'm sorry , will .
admiral , this is an almost totally new enterprise . you do n't know her a tenth as well as i do .
my experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the enterprise , this crew ...
may i ask why ?
yes .
-- you , personally , are assuming command ?
you 'll stay aboard as executive officer ... a temporary grade reduction to commander .
i 'm replacing you as captain of the enterprise .
you are what ... ?
i 'm taking over the center seat . i 'm sorry , will .
you got the enterprise , it 's what < u > you < /u > wanted . this is what i want . but , jim ... ... < u > i 'm < /u > the right choice for this mission .
jim ... he < u > wants < /u > it .
we have twenty-one minutes . captain , we can still save v'ger ... and ourselves .
that transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and the creator .
v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe , thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions . to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension ; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator .
mr. spock , what would v'ger need to fulfill itself ?
a tractor beam ...
forward motion , captain ... !
it seems we < u > all < /u > imagine god in our own image .
then v'ger believes the creator to be a < u > machine < /u > too .
that probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that < u > killed < /u > ilia !
exactly . and you did have a 'relationship ' with lieutenant ilia , commander .
we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in < u > precise < /u > detail . suppose that beneath its programming , the real ilia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision .
it 's a programmed < u > mechanism < /u > , mr. spock ...
captain ... this probe may be a key a key to the aliens .
this served the purpose .
we could have cut it off at the main computer ...
that would presuppose a feeling , commander ... compassion . i sensed < u > no < /u > emotion , only ... ... pure logic .
they may have attacked only as a warning to us , captain . to keep away .
no .
if i 'd seen you again , would you have been able to say it ?
that you left ? or that you did n't say 'goodbye ' ?
no more than i expected not as difficult as this . i 'm sorry ...
was he difficult ?
wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems ... !
navigational deflectors inoperative ... ! directional control also inoperative , captain ... !
unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us , captain ! directly ahead ... !
negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed .
i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species . you can assure him that 's true , ca n't you ?
i now the captain meant no person- al insult .
decker ... . !
hello , ilia .
viewer , standard ahead .
fifteen seconds to cloud boundary .
opinion , mister . spock ?
thirty seconds to cloud boundary ...
ten seconds ... .
transmit , mr. spock ! now !
impact in fifteen seconds ...
mr. spock ?
i stand corrected mr. decker . navigator , lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center ; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there ...
five minutes to cloud boundary !
mr. chekov , stand by on the phasers ... !
twelve seconds ... !
time to impact ... ?
my oath of celibacy is on record captain . may i assume my duties ?
and in you , too , lieutenant .
our exec and science officer ...
'commander ' decker ?
welcome aboard , lieutenant .
lieutenant ilia reporting for duty , sir .
that was the order , mr. sulu : clear the bridge .
clear the bridge , captain ... ?
thrusters at station keeping ...
hold station ... !
thrusters ahead , one third .
maneuvering thrusters , mr. sulu ; ahead one third . full sensor scan , mr. spock ; they ca n't expect us < u > not < /u > to look them over now !
viewer ahead , sir .
viewer ahead .
hold relative position here ...
one hundred kilometers ...
adjust parallel course , navigator . bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance .
we 're already two settings below that , sir .
reduce magnification . factor 4 , mr. sulu .
aye , sir .
mr. sulu , steady as she goes .
accelerating to warp one , sir .
ahead warp one , mr sulu .
thrusters at station-keeping , sir .
hold station .
maneuvering thrusters , sir .
maneuvering thrusters , mister sulu .
he 's in engineering , sir ... he does n't know .
i appreciate the welcome ; i wish the circumstances were less critical . epsilon nine is monitoring the intruder ; keep a channel open to them . where is captain decker ?
starfleet , boost your matter gain ; we need more signal !
we 're losing the pattern ... !
two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale , mr. scott -- but i would n't exactly consider myself 'untried . '
the crew has n't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment . and the engines , admiral : they 've yet to be even tested at warp power . add to that , an untried captain ...
mr. scott , there 's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet ...
admiral , the enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting . she needs testing , a shakedown ...
see that it is . take me over , please .
we 're hoping it 's only a temporary problem , admiral ...
why are n't the enterprise transporters in operation , mister scott ?
admiral , i 've been hoping to see you . maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that ...
i prefer your poet dante 's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit . '
... and the 'foolish ' emotions which drive us ?
yes , captain . it needed our mortality , the fear of it , our struggle against it , our fears , our dreams ...
spock , we < u > were < /u > its answer !
that seems to be what it has planned -- to have the creator physically present here .
there 's no way to know . v'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity . all of us here may be reduced into patterns ...
... and then to reassemble itself < u > combined < /u > with the creator . the most certain way of obtaining all the creator 's answers .
v'ger plans to literally < u > meld < /u > to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns ...
the point is , captain , < u > twenty-two < /u >
the point ...
captain , the orbital device will not be triggered for twenty-two minutes ...
there is no alternative .
has not , doctor -- and now , because of what we are planning ... will not ...
no , captain , not for us ... for v'ger .
not for us ?
precisely .
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point , then ... ?
yes , captain , a child : evolving into adulthood -- learning , searching -- instinctively needing .
child ... ! ?
high mag , mr. sulu !
these read as identical composition ... ... however , captain , they measure several hundred times more powerful !
'is this all i am ? is there not more ? '
what answers ?
no meaning ... no hope ... and , jim , no answers ... ! jim , it 's looking for < u > answers < /u > < u > itself < /u > !
what should you have known ?
a life form of its own ; a conscious , living entity .
were you right ? spock ? v'ger is a living machine ... ?
captain , i do not believe there < u > is < /u > a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such .
if this is their ship 's data banks , where is the crew ? or is their entire ship automated ?
exact patterns . the energy bolt that hit them was n't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them , stored them . but why ?
klingons ... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia ! ! they seem to be more than just images ...
new crystals : they must contain the most recent data obtained --
and these 'sensor-swarms ' collect that data , carry it here .
it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information . a remarkably efficient system .
answers to what , spock ? our dilemma -- or your < u > personal < /u > one ?
i am seeking answers , captain .
bridge , cancel rescue teams . spock , what in the hell are you doing out here !
i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information .
spock ? concerned about his chances ?
ilia 's memory , her feelings of loyalty , friendship , obedience ... might all be there .
... they may have followed it < u > too < /u > precisely .
they had a pattern to follow ...
i believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . a technology so incredibly sophisticated that i can not --
have you been able to analyze < u > any < /u > of this ... ?
delay that order , scotty ... ! disengage all main drive systems !
we can not break free , captain . we do not have a fraction of the power necessary .
get someone up here to take the navigator 's station ... ! engineering ... full emergency power !
captain , we have been seized by a tractor beam ... !
transmit image of the alien to starfleet ; advise we are attempting further communication .
that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth 's sun .
instruments fluctuating , captain . patterns unrecognizable .
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude ...
mr. decker ... ?
recommend we proceede , captain .
but they understood our messages ; they broke off the attack .
we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality ... yet they can not understand who we are , or what we want .
our ... 'insignificance ' ?
the 'puzzlement ' i sensed was fleeting ... minor ... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance , captain .
any reply from them ?
it appears that our message has been understood , captain .
communicated with us < u > how < /u > ?
they have ... they < u > have < /u > been communicating with us . i sense ... < u > puzzlement < /u > . why have we not replied ?
mr. decker , i will not provoke an attack , if that order is n't clear to you ...
captain , i suspect there 's an object at the heart of that cloud .
intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center . energy of a type entirely un- known to me .
do < u > not < /u > return scan , mr. spock ! it may be misinterpreted as hostility !
i know this has been painful , spock . for me too . thank you .
i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer ... sir .
let it drop , bones . you are my science officer -- i 'll expect an < u > immediate < /u > report on anything further you learn or < u > sense < /u > from here on .
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not .
and whatever you sensed out here ... .
i still contain fragments of my human half .
that inquiry invades my personal life , captain .
also -- there was nothing in your report about < u > why < /u > you 're here .
negative , captain . i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic . i can explain nothing more ; i understand nothing more .
you 've reported that you felt strong thought emotions . a group of minds from a space vessel ? could you make out any plan , anything to do with earth ?
i want him here . sit down !
sir , i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview .
sit down , please .
reporting as ordered , captain .
i intend to be there following that meeting . report to me . one hour !
to you , sir ?
twelve ! i 'm on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than three minutes . report to me on the enterprise in one hour .
which will require twenty more hours at minimum , admiral ...
here at starfleet ... ? the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock ...
captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before ...
why are n't you on board ?
based , i am told , on your recommendation , admiral . thank you .
you 've received your appointment as enterprise science officer ?
thank you , scotty . stand by .
we 're ready , sir .
engineering ... status , mr. scott ?
aye , we understand that sir ! we 're doing our best .
that object out there is less than two days from earth , mister scott . we 've got to intercept while it still is out there !
captain , it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place . it will happen again if we do n't correct it .
warp drive as soon as possible , mr. scott .
engineer , we need warp speed now !
captain , we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors ...
tractor beam remains constant ...
starfleet has been apprised of our situation , captain .
< u > urgent < /u > signal from starfleet , captain ! < u > all < /u > earth defense systems have gone dead .
the third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming ...
confirm , captain . lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into earth orbit ...
starfleet signals , sir , growing in strength ... they -- have intruder on their monitors -- it 's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate ...
subspace frequencies are jammed by wormhole effect !
negative helm control , captain ! going reverse on impulse power ... !
helm ready , sir .
dock control reports ready , sir .
dock signals clear , captain .
transporters room and chief engineer scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally , sir .

let me be the judge of that .
i 'm not .
thank god . i got to see you . grown up .

this is a joke , right ?
he 's not even there . you do n't see him , you do n't hear him , you 're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys .
you have to ignore him .
i call him a fartface or a pervert , or something equally lame .
and what do you do wh ...
good girl .
not with my mouth open .
you would n't kiss him , huh ?
... they all yell 'there goes the virgin queen ' or the 'ice princess ' , or some < u > really < /u > clever cut like that . like it hurts my feelings .
you do n't like his friends .
every time i 'm on the lunch yard , and he 's with twelve of his retarded < u > dorkface < /u > little adoring out-crowd < u > henchmen < /u > ...
actually . i could only help him .
great .
i could help with the debate .
a debate . man 's inhumanity to woman . he 's pro women . i 'm con . ms. flannery is twisted .

she is but an arriviste .
she is only the < u > princess < /u > of cool . < u > mommy < /u > is the queen !
and ... ?
he would n't know . < u > i < /u > saw her in the shower !

you lied . if you lied < u > then < /u > , maybe you 're lying < u > now < /u > . i can < u > never < /u > belive you < u > again < /u > !
i know how scared < u > i < /u > get when < u > you 're < /u > sick . so i waited to tell you . until it was getting smaller . i thought that was best , maybe i was wr ...
secret 's safe with me .
and do n't tell her i told you .
i bet .
actually . she 's kind of cool , when you get to know her .
she knows every neat junk food place .
like a big sister .
... i mean , she knows all the music , and pop stars , and clothes and stuff . she 's like still a kid , herself .
are you < u > kidding < /u > ? it is < u > so < /u > much better than the one rachel showed me !
i hope it 's the right kind .
well . it 's for you .
wow . who 's that for ?
i 'll be there for you .
that happens . to families .
like seeing the good side of rachel . so she 'll see the good side of us .
like how ?
but we do have a choice . to make it better . instead of worse .
daddy and i tried hard . we really did .
no i 'm not . i do n't care . why should i care ? i mean nobody asked me when you got divorced . nobody asked me if i wanted a new mother . nobody even asked me if i like her . if you guys do n't care about our family staying together , why sh ...
look she 's upset --
or blush . you look pale .
well daddy and i are just friends now , and that 's no reason not to wear mascara ...
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates ...
i 'm a little tired and it 's just a pick-me-up .
then why are you putting on mascara ?
probably you -- your brother -- school -- the solar system ... the usual ...
what are you gon na talk about ?
because it 's quiet . and he wants to talk . alise -- once he saws you in half , it 's bedtime ...
i like talking about it . at least , to you .
so why are you asking me ?
because it feels really incredibly good .
... why do you think ?
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh ...
i live . in the same country .
how would you know sh ...
during sex .
scream .
why does rachel scream ?
well , not exactly s ...
sex . of course .
daddy was washing rachel . in the shower . what did you think that was about ?
i 'll ride ahead . nelson , protect the queen ...
lord nelson , napoleon 's troops . i fear for the women and the property values .
annabelle , daddy and i will always be there . that 's one time always is always . you can call him after dinner but ...
i 'm gon na call him .
never say never you always say that . i 'll bet daddy 's mad at me now .
that will never happen .
what happens when he loves rachel more than us ?
it happens .
it just slipped out .
well , he 's not president anymore , so why be petty .
like who ?
look if the truth is you do n't feel like talking about this right now that 's fine . but do n't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me . cause there are only so many lies you 're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face . you wind up looking like ...
i 'm not upset . why would i be upset ?
maybe you 're upset that rachel moved in .
mass hysteria .
well you 're telling your teachers and your friends --
i do n't want that to happen . why would i want that to happen ?
well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen .
i did n't say that . why would i say that ?
excellent point .
i hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up .
thank you . those were all words . i hate the planet uranus . < u > terrible < /u > name for a planet .
i hate when you say that .
< u > never < /u > say 'never ' -- it 's < u > not < /u > fair to say 'always ' -- and < u > no < /u > name calling . use your words .
i know you do n't , but if you had , chrom- atically you < u > are < /u > in the purple family .
i do n't care .
... it 's really not so bad annabelle -- red and blue make purple .
a < u > suitable < /u > boy , will be at < u > this < /u > flagpole , < u > on < /u > monday , with a < u > very < /u > expensive bike , and he will be a stone fox if i have to call an < u > escort < /u > service !
but rache ...
the guy < u > i < /u > see is in the eighth grade at < u > prep < /u > school , and he laughs his < u > ass < /u > off every time we talk about you .
he 'll be impressed . the clincher is , you < u > walk < /u > away , then < u > whip < /u > around ...
in high school .
oh . it 's an incredibly disgusting , and not remotely sexy thing , that they described in a movie i 'd never let you go to . but it 's real . does he have an older brother ?
uh . what is it ?
no . but they stand out , a little . like this .
great . big ears , too ?
uh . he thinks his nose is too big . but it 's not .
help me here ...
no , baby . you 're gon na use < u > my < /u > words .
not use my words , please !
and you < u > do n't < /u > tell her . what you 're going to say .
that 's because your mother is a fine person , finer than i will ever be . now , just this once ...
and mom says anger never , never < u > solves < /u > anything . it makes every- thing < u > worse < /u > .
no , < u > his < /u > mother 's always on time .
now is that little prick still here , because if he is , i 'm gon na rip his fucking < u > heart < /u > out !
... laughed , yeh . they laughed real hard .
i < u > did < /u > what she said . i < u > used < /u > my words , i < u > told < /u > him what i < u > felt < /u > , and they ...
it 's not your < u > fault < /u > ! !
oh , baby , i 'm so sor ...

people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money .
does rachel make a lot of money ?
ben , mommies work too . they work very hard . mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working . i just do n't get paid .
rachel 's job is she works .
no , that 's your fault . it 's her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . which means , the most important job .
mommy ? it 's not rachel 's fault i ran away .
i knew where i was all the time .

you ca n't < u > do < /u > that , i wo n't < u > let < /u > you !
duncan . i 've got an < u > even < /u > < u > better < /u > idea ...

they 're losing one mother . they ca n't lose two .
look , i will < u > send < /u > a p.a . to pick up the children . there are < u > agencies < /u > that supply sitters , nannies ...
which part of no do n't you understand ?
we do n't know if you 've got it , we have n't seen it yet ! now go back and finish !
i 've got it . it 's in the can , cooper can wrap th ...
but you 're not < u > done < /u > !
it 's 1:45 , i told you there 's no one to pick up annab ...
duncan . my work is everything to me . this 'll never happen again . now stand back -- this session 's gon na make you remember why you hired me even though i would n't sleep with you -- cooper let 's get these penguins dancing --
congratulations . only forty minutes late . you 're handling this promotion really well rachel .
a lot smaller .
i had a lot of treatments , and they were n't any fun , but the tests show the cancer got smaller .
i live or i die .
what happens next ?
walk in the park . and thanks for the 'we ' .
we 're going to win this .
i know . i would n't know what to say . if it were you .
yeh , better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and ... couscous , was it she made him ? boy , kids go wild for that .
yet another spaghetti night .
never stand between that kid and a meatball .
you want us to take him tonight ? give you some private time with annab ... .
it 's good . you 're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us , are you ?
it 's temporary .
stop . you 're making me insecure .
she 's a charmer , you 'll see . in fifty years , the kids 'll love her ten percent as much as they love you .
and we all went through that together ?
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced ?
the great thing about life is that things keep changing .
no . you think this is going to help the kids then you do it . you 're on your own .
you 're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us . we should tell them together .
we 're still their parents for the next hundred years .
we are over .
we ...
you ca n't be an 'us ' just when you want to . you ca n't play that card when it 's convenient .
it 's a huge moment in their life --
to make it easier for them or you ?
it 's going to be hard for the kids when i tell them ... i 'd like you to be there .
just not to me .
i grew up , a little . i 'm ready for a life that 's built around commitm ...
tell me exactly how you 're different from three years ago ? the music sounds kind of the same from where i 'm sitting .
i did n't think a phone call was appropriate ...
getting so beautiful ... she looks more like you every day . jackie ... i 've really given this a lot of thought . a great deal of thought ...
annabelle showed me the new dress . she 's amazing in it .
still , please .
and i 'm supposed to care .
i 'm afraid she 's going to walk .
< u > slugs < /u > . have faster learning curves . < u > trees < /u > , even .
you know the kids are n't really in danger . this is about rachel , and you 're right , i 'm disappointed in her learning curve , and ...
partly . but partly , you 're mad .
you 're saying , do n't make the kids a football , do n't put them through a war . but i 'm doing this for < u > their < /u > well-being .
do n't do this .
called him . we set an ap ...
we 've broken a lot of promises , have n't we luke ?
jackie stop . we promised we never go there .
i 'm not gon na wait around to see the next one . i 'm not gon na watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement . i 'm seeing a lawyer .
jackie , you 've made mistakes -- we all make mistakes --
not to me .
but he has n't . he wandered off . i know it 's terrifying . i can imagine how you felt when that call came -- but it happens .
do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today ? how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did ? he could have been ...
our children .
... until the plan changed , when jessie 's mom gave us these tickets . what , rachel . 'forgot ' i told her ?
jackie , < u > we < /u > were taking them water- skiing for the < u > whole < /u > weekend !
at the big apple circus , it 's the only big top i know . i < u > said < /u > i 'd get 'em back tonight ...
you 're where ?
just outside the big top , we 're almo ...
good ... well ... take care .
easy enough .
fine . but i wanted to take the kids to work with me on wednesday so i 'll take wednesday , and you can pick up that thursday , friday after soccer , and saturday before riding .
luke , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why do n't you take the weekend ... ... that way you 'll be there , and i 'll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .
me too .
i 'm worried .
you ask me that counselor 's making a mountain out of a molehill ...
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes ...
i 'll call from work . we can have a conference call .
it 's wednesday night . she 's at my house . i 'll talk to her .
thank you mrs. franklin . jackie ? this has been very valuable for us . and i 'll have a serious talk with annabelle tonight .
jackie , she was five minutes late --
except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up --
napalm .
jackie , they come to be part of my life . rachel < u > is < /u > part of that life .
they want to be with you luke , they go to your house to be with their father .
well , we 're not discussing rachel 's age either .
we 're not discussing your age .
rachel 's not half my age .
since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids , he 's now living with a woman half his age --
i 've been with someone for quite some time , and did n't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly . but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids i might add -- she moved in last month .
you think i did n't get that ?
something 's up wi ...
i 'm here . i 've got a case where they 're this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing ? !
because you do n't really seem here .
i 'm here .
are you here ?
remarried . there is no move .
planning on getting --
just sit me up . nice and tall . bring benjamin first .
you know , there 's nothing you have to say . because they know your heart . you do n't have t ...
just want to be a little sharper . for a few minutes .
now edna says you short-changed your last meds . you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time , y'know .
i have their past .
you know every story , every wound , every memory , their whole life 's < u > happiness < /u > has been wrapped up in < u > you < /u > , every moment ...
you 'll learn .
you ride with annabelle ...
you 're the hip and fresh .
everything . you 're ... the earth mother incarnate ...
what do i have that you do n't ?
with good reason . they fucking worship you as it is .
uh . you hate my guts ?
why did n't i ?
he only remembers i < u > found < /u > him . my point is , telling you this story would have been the kindest , most helpful thing i could ever have done for you .
ben never mentioned it .
i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off . doing my imitation of you .
you are lying , you never lost that kid for 4 < u > seconds < /u > , you could find him from a < u > coma < /u > , there is no way !
i lost him . i was panicked .
you 're lying .
maybe i was wrong on that one .
come on , a wuss like me ? the stiff who would n't help her own daughter fight back ?
well , it 's the jack kennedy syndrome , huh ? you die young , you always look golden . perfect . the memory kind of burnishes the image , and ...
is scary . but you want it . gim me some truth here .
i never wanted to be a mom . then , sharing it with you was one thing . carrying it alone , the rest of my life ...
and i have looked down the road . at what my life will be . and i ca n't handle it .
no , there is n't .
i love luke , i love the children . but there is more to life than even love ...
do n't flatter yourself . i always liked that line .
what 's this about ? because we < u > fought < /u > ?
double .
she likes a stolie , no ice .
neutral ground . what 's up ?
thanks for coming out .
< u > that 's < /u > what it is . and that 's < u > all < /u > it is .
you 've turned her into you . and i may not get another chance . to turn her back .
and she 'll fight back again . god help me , what have i done .
and there will come < u > another < /u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really < /u > there . and she will look back on this . and remember how good it felt . how easy it was .
well , that 's what parenting is < u > about < /u > , little girl . they are < u > pleading < /u > to know how they are supposed to do it . and you sure as hell < u > showed < /u > her .
she was n't steering her own course , she was steering < u > yours < /u > .
doing the < u > right < /u > thing . knowing who you < u > are < /u > , inside . not < u > caving < /u > to peer pressure , or < u > lowering < /u > yourself to that level , < u > steering < /u > your < u > own < /u > course ...
shut the fuck up . < u > i < /u > did n't go behind < u > your < /u > back .
oh please .
see , in that crisis , i saw an opportunity . for some < u > real < /u > growth .
well , maybe < u > your < /u > version of growing up is 'just win , baby ' .
you were n't passing 'em out .
you think < u > i < /u > did n't have some dirty words for that little putz ? you think < u > i < /u > could n't figure out some low blows ?
that 's not wh ...
you taught my child that i am some limp dick < u > loser < /u > . who did n't < u > care < /u > about her pain .
so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck .
she was beaten , and bloodied , and it was going to go on , uni ...
worked . like a charm .
you had her < u > lie < /u > about that ... that fancy-boy < u > model < /u > !
aw .
you put filth in my child 's mouth .
right down to the ground . let 's get to it .
you are < u > defending < /u > what you did ?
is that what you 're worried about ? looking bad at the pta ?
actually . they 'll want annabelle 's mother .
give 'em my number .
because there 'll be , oh , 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so . and they 'll b ...
it does n't matter , i did n't tell h ...
now , 'limp dick ' , i know . what . is 'snowballing ' ?
do n't be too sure .
and i 'm going to win .
are we .
now we 're going to have a fight , you and i .
he looks familiar . did he do a calvin klein ad ?
looks nice enough to m ...
who in the world < u > is < /u > he ?
you really did n't have to come , you know . i 'd have brought them straight t ...
he wo n't discuss it . just calls it history .
is that what he told you ?
that thing you said before . pushing the guy sleeping next to you away . because of what you gave up for motherhood ...
took 28 hours . she just was n't sure about entering this world .
and her ... ?
somehow , his blanket always looked like a cape , even the nurse said that . he < u > loves < /u > to hear that story , over and over . how he was born a magician .
feeling the pressure ?
my advice to you ? do n't die .
that 's motherhood . that 's the job , with or without a career . i 'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness . they < u > need < /u > you to be happy .
i just want to spend time with them when i 'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or ...
i know you , huh ? the car pools , he measles , the pta . it 's not gon na be enough for you in the long run . you have to think long term .
yes . i made the choice that was right for me . and i do n't regret it . but even for me , there were days when i felt so lost , so invis- ible . and then i 'd hate myself for the kids not being enough .
it 's the same choice you made .
juggle it ! move the darkroom into your house . you 've got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway . do n't lose your confidence . do n't lose your edge .
hey , you have n't quit on you , i 'm sure as hell not gon na . i just mean , i 'm juggling a lot right n ...
you mean , after i 'm dead ?
it was just a job , there 'll be plenty of others .
do what you 've worked your whole life to do ?
it 's just not the right time t ...
no .
i 'm thinking . do i know you well enough to really chew you out ?
... go to the park . in the worst way .
hon , maybe your mom would like t ...
it 's < u > covered < /u > , okay ? i appreciate your concern . can i talk to her ?
yah ? well , even the best mom in the world , the smartest , the wisest , whatever . needs to know when to find a plan b. cos plan a < u > is < /u > not and < u > will < /u > n ...
thanks , but it 's under control .
can i say one thing ? i mean , the < u > last < /u > thing i want to do is inter- fere on the brad thing , b ...
how 's she doing with brad ?
yeh , she 's ... i 'll get you ben first , it 's past his bedti ...
eat your heart out . is annabelle there ?
what else ? keep on keepin ' on .
and you said ...
he 's relentless . a < u > major < /u > asshole .
i think my 'primo shit ' got left in my 'bellbottoms . '
the primo stuff is great for pain .
brad kovitsky .
you try to center on the big issues , y'know . what it 's all about . what this whole trip has meant . but then , the < u > really < /u > big issues keep swamping y ...
yeh , that 's bull . i 'm going for serene , they say some actually get there .
you look sick . but you look ... together . mentally tough .
i really look like shit .
it 's promising , this one . we 're upbeat .
so . hopeful .
it 's a mess , right now . that 's my project when i get back .
can i look at the pictures ?
beats me . ask your mom .
and you said ... ?
does n't < u > begin < /u > to describe it . i mean , you 've got cancer , < u > this < /u > is serious .
she 's devastated .
right . which is the whole < u > point < /u > of this 'going out ' thing , so one of them can dump the other one , and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy , without ever having to actually date .
oh , my god .
anyway . he walks up to her on lunch yard today . and tells her ... publicly ... that they 're 'breaking up . '
... going out , yeh . i had kids of my own , once .
as you may know , 'going out ' in the six grade does n't mean shit . they do n't actually < u > go < /u > to a movie or anywhere , they do n't even eat lunch together , it 's just a declaration to the world that they 're ...
toi . they 've been 'going out ' for two weeks .
moi ?
she was afraid you 'd make a big deal out of it .
she has n't mentioned this .
that . and . annabelle is over her head . with brad 'the dreamboat ' kovitsky .
you 're a cross-dresser .
so i have to tell you something in confidence ...
luke 's depo ran late . i promised i 'd take notes .
small world .
ironic , huh ?
okay , i 'm undeserving .
i have given them more < u > love < /u > and more < u > care < /u > every fifteen < u > minutes < /u > of their lives , than you could manage in the next fifty < u > years < /u > !
see , i know that .
they came out of my < u > body < /u > !
you are < u > marrying < /u > the < u > greatest < /u > guy who walks this < u > earth < /u > . who i have < u > loved < /u > from my < u > heart < /u > for twelve < u > years < /u > !
and cigarettes . i smoke , too .
how would you know < u > anything < /u > ?
i do n't , but ...
how the hell would you know ?
you bet you are .
you 're not dying .
life 's a trade-off . you get cancer , your hair falls out , but you < u > do < /u > get to smoke dope .
really . by what right ? six months of part-time screw-ups ?
i got used to ... thinking of them . as ... my kids too .
... it 's my problem , too .
then let him talks to me . we do n't need you to solve our prob ...
luke . ca n't live like that .
did i hear the word ...
we ca n't live like that .
bi-coastal parenting . happens every day . luke gets the kids every other summer , every other holiday , it 's not ideal , but people make it work , and ...
but i came here to ...
nobody likes a snoop .
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable ...
do n't flatter yourself .
look , you 've never liked me ...
you 're taking the kids . and moving to san francisco .
you what ?
you 're not working at random house , i talked to them .
my boss .
i was looking for annabelle 's book , and i found your tickets . and the note . from your new boss .
i do n't know wh ...
let 's ... hold up for a bit . it may not happen . our secret , okay ?
uh . have you told luke and the ki ...
hey , any help you need , we 'll cover .
... make some trips into the city . sometimes , overnight .
wowie . how wonderful !
... thinking of going back to random house . on a part-time basis .
not great . plus , i 've got things on my mind . you know .
you feeling all right ?
when i twisted hair like this it means i 'm intimidated by you ...
yes ?
jackie ?
she was angry at herself .
last week when she chopped her barbie 's bangs all to hell --
anxiety .
what about obsessively picking her split ends ?
no way . i told her two , three years , maybe , for such an expens ...
hey . at least it 's not an editing machine .
i 'm sorry , i just ...
it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .
sorry i 'm late , i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's .
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish ?
not personally .
ben likes to be read to . do you know dr. seuss ... ?
why not just bring the whole toilet ?
bandaids for cuts . bandaids for new shoe blisters . packet of wash n dri 's . kleenex . sugar free lollipops , potty seat covers for public restrooms ...
fine , forget it .
i 'm already on thin ice . yesterday , i actually thought my boss was going to fire me .
however many . it 's not enough .
what ? and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders ? how many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors ?
i have an appointment this after- noon . i need someone to take them to the park .
i did it for her .
so why did y ...
those are < u > my < /u > children you 're practicing on . they deserve < u > first- < /u > rate care . every minute . of every night . and every day .
i need practice .
you 're not terribly good at taking care of h ...
she already hates me . you 've seen to that .
i did n't do it for you . believe me .
i did n't need you to take the blame for me , i 'm quite ...
i have a snoop .
i do n't recall inviting you .
i 'm sorry . look , i 'm not real comfortable being here , but ...
... in .
a court < u > order < /u > is gon na say that < u > woman < /u > is < u > never < /u > < u > alone < /u > with my children ! ever < u > again < /u > ! do you hear that ?
well , maybe they would if they thought it was okay , with y ...
i am not < u > here < /u > to make it easier for you . these are < u > my < /u > children . they do n't want to < u > be < /u > with you .
you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once . that woman has nothing more to do with my children .
jackie , if i thought for one moment ...
i 'm sorry i did n't mean to break your concentration . i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb ...
annabelle does n't really want to talk to you right now .
think twice . before you < u > ever < /u > pull that again .
yeh ?
of all the < u > cheap < /u > excuses . to break a child 's heart .
look , i ...
machines do not eat message .
you got to hell !
but it 's not on the schedule !
get out !
maybe the problem is your < u > kids < /u > . maybe they 're spoiled , coddled < u > brats < /u > !
oh and i do n't because i have a children ? ! the problem is you 're too self-involved to ever be a mother .
you 're damn right . i 'm gon na sick of your imperious bullshit . i never said i was betty fucking crocker . if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead ! i have a life !
you mean for you . a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it 's best for her if every- one pretends it did n't happen ? this is n't going to work out .
no . i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards ?
i was in there in him .
i 'm sure that did n't upset her . everyone in our family takes showers .
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking .
< u > forgiveness ? < /u > for < u > what < /u > , exactly ?
... a ridiculously < u > expensive < /u > and < u > inappropriate < /u > item , which her father and i have already < u > told < /u > her she is < u > far < /u > too young to own . but < u > you < /u > apparently want to < u > buy < /u > her forgiveness , with ...
she 's been talking about this little editing machine , it 's only ...
nothing . look , i want to talk to you about ... well ... luke said to ask you ...
what did you do ?
maybe you could back off just a little bit --
what happened with annabelle ? has nothing i said gotten through to you ?
annabelle , how 's your video rep ...
what is this ? the betty ford center ?
we do n't have any coffee .
can i please have a cup of coffee ?
every tuesday except the 3rd tuesday of the month when it 's switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday . it 's not that hard . did n't you have a mother ?
this is friday , her riding lesson is on tuesdays . i got it right here ...
how do you hold down a job ? it 's 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she 's missed her sunrise groom'n ride .
i 'm gon na get me a drink .
where you goin ' ?
how about the promises we make to our kids ? about < u > their < /u > future . do we shrug those off , just that easily ?
we make our lives , one step at a time . we do the best we can . the truth about the future ? a promise . is only a hope .
because you 've changed so much .
that 's not us .
'but keep dancing , and if you 're lucky , i might just never leave , who knows ? '
no , here 's ugly . 'i love < u > you < /u > , babe . it 's just our < u > life < /u > together i 'm not so sure about ... '
that 's a pretty ugly thing you just said .
no , she threw you out . what a difficult woman .
' ... i do n't know if i can make it . ' that 's what i said . but i did n't leave .
excuse me . 'things are so confusing for me , jack . our life feels too comfortable , too safe , too predict- able . it 's a partnership , it 's juggling schedules . when i think of playing that out , every day , for the rest of my life ... '
restless .
by way of saying you were unhappy .
i told her i loved her .
let me put it this way . hell , no .
can we go sit somewhere ?
what do you call it ? you told her you had doubts .
she called it a fight . < u > the < /u > fight .
' ... the kids have camp . their friends are here . over there , i 'll just be shopping in a language i do n't even know . my life , and the kids ' lives , are n't here to service your mid-life crisis . ' did it go like that ?
... while she watched the kids . then , you booked this flat in paris for your family 's summer . but she said ...
i needed some time away .
you took a fishing trip with the boys . liked it so much , you took another .
why in the world would she t ...
imagine my relief . so what 's for dinner ?
well , they will be .
just like to make sure . that your past . and my future . are real different .
hold your applause . we 're not having fun , here .
what a great surpri ...
i made that paella you liked . it 's on the stove .
no problem .
i know that .
she 's not gon na die .
great , wallow in guilt , you < u > sure < /u > you 're not jewish ?
they 're my kids .
are you hungry ? you could make us something ?
it 's anna sui , you should be doing it .
it 's just an assignment .
it 's no biggie .
well , i think you should tell him you changed your mi ...
what 's eight , ten years ? hell , you 'll still be ambulatory . i think .
rache , it may take time .
everything 's gon na work out . the kids and i ... we 're going to love each other .
because i ca n't hurt anyone like this ever again .
okay ... is that the good thing or the bad thing ?
it 's forever you know .
i think so too ...
i think so ... what do you think ?
oh my god . are you serious ?
you have n't done < u > one < /u > goddam thing to make any of this easier ...
rache , get out of th ...
why are you taking this out on < u > him < /u > ?
our weekend . at that sweet little b & amp ; b .
and it 's < u > my < /u > call . i promised them water-skiing , instead o ...
we have the kids . next weekend .
hey , i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two o'clo ...
not yet .
uh . annabelle 's video report has been switched again .
get ready . to get < u > really < /u > mad .
you know i do n't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot ... your ex-wife 's doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just do n't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long ! jesus what did you see in her ? i do n't get it -- i just do n't get it .
no you do n't . and i 'm not gon na screw with my kids heads right now --
oh right ... so it 's just complicated for you and jackie -- for me it 's pretty simple cause i just do n't understand ...
it 's complicated for jackie . it 's complicated for me ... you do n't have kids -- you do n't understand --
really ? look in your ex-wife 's eyes .
nobody 's telling them to hate you --
and what you 're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
they do n't hate you --
look . i know they hate me .
i know how responsible , caring adults parent children . i 'm bribe 'em . but 'em a dog or something . maybe a doberman .
but you 're not good at this . not yet . i 'm sorry .
but ? but what ?
i trust you of course i do but --
you do n't trust me to be alone with them .
ca n't handle them myself is what you mean . ca n't .
you do n't need to . i do n't expect you to handle them yourself .
i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --
just a babysitter -- i mean ... you 're working ...
for what ?
anyway , i thought ... while i 'm gone ... maybe i 'll hire in some help .
jesus .
we have the kids this weekend , so ...
so i 'll have to order in ?
i just found out i have to go to boston to get a deposition . i might not be back until saturday .
yeh , it 's cheaper .
you 'd rather spoil our walk home .
i did n't want to spoil our supper ...
uh-oh . i mention marriage , all of a sudden ... ve < u > haff < /u > to ta ...
we have to talk .
the way you cook . if you could make love , i 'd marry you .
well , it was n't a reduction like you do it ! boiling down half a ton of bones ...
it was a veal stock , i thi ...
okay , if they 're going to < u > have < /u > a sauce , put something < u > in < /u > it besides flour and chicken broth ...
tucker has n't penned ben 's present yet -- it wo n't be too much longer .
something came up . c'mon ben ! i 've got a shoot at three ...
in seven years jackie 's never missed one of tucker 's parties . where is she ?
no . i 'm doing it behind her back .
does jackie know this ?
hi , i 'm here to pick up ben .
hmmm ... do i know any ... personally ... ?
well , i 'm supposed to watch schindler 's list for homework . the movie 's like almost four hours . and then i 'm supposed to write a report on survivors . you know any survivors , dad ?
oh , yeah ?
we 're studying the holocaust in social studies .
man , i am out of here ! this family is so fucked !
you heard me : leave the table !
what ?
out ! leave the table !
he is n't .
what if he is ?
do n't ever say that .
maybe he 's gay .
i do n't know what 's wrong with that kid .
thanks , scoob .
no prob . i 'm cool .
and like , do n't take this the wrong way ... i mean , i 'm cool ... but ... you know ... i 've got a good reputation at school and , well ... i really do n't want it ruined .
oh .
you know ... stanley ...
like what ?
there are some rumors ...
what ?
there 's something i need to talk about with you .
hey . what 's up ?
hey .
but that could 've happened to him . or to me , if i 'd been alive . or you .
even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
well , he did . with his family . but his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed . and if he 'd stayed , he would have been killed . so in my book he 's a survivor .
but i thought he came over to america before the war .
well , no . but he had to escape the nazis .
he was in a concentration camp ?
well , technically your zeda is a survivor .
he 's vegetarian , does n't do sports ...
marty , ignore him .
tv talk-show host , ok. you were at sidekick eight seconds ago , then tv talk-show host . you 'll be a latin dictator in a bout a minute .
be your sidekick , you know , and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host .
ahh ... tell me . what do you want to do for me ? what 's your idea ?
well , i was thinking ... i might work for you .
and thank you for dressing up for us . this is very classy . tell us . what kind of professional plans do you have ? what 's in your future ?
great to be here .
nice to have you here .
thank you .
welcome to the show , scooby .
really ? well , all right ! let 's take a look at the television and see how we look .
i 'll be your guest !
i 'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show . any suggestions ?
conan o'brien ? whoa ! what are you doing here ?
hey , scooby ! how 's it going ?
well then , when you get older you can do something about it .
sometimes i feel like my parents do n't love me .
it is when you love someone , and they do n't love you . and then you do something about it .
consuelo , what is rape exactly ?
for rape and murder .
why was he on death row ?
i know !
but really , you never know .
i am sure .
but still , you ca n't be sure .
he was n't .
maybe he was and you just did n't know it .
jesus was not bad .
maybe it 's for the besti mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrongpeople who are bad should be killed . do n't you think so ?
poison gas .
how did they execute him ?
he was executed . he was on death row and then he was executed .
oh . how did it happen ?
he 's dead .
gee , i did n't even know you had any children . but why are you so upset about jesus ?
my grandchild-baby .
you have a bay ?
my baby .
who is jesus ?
my jesus
consuelo , i 'm sorry , but you know if you do n't speak english i ca n't understand you .
mi jesus esta muerto !
speak english .
mi jesusmi jesus
yes , you are . i can tell . what 's the matter ?
no .
consuelo . are you crying ?
but it 's not like real work . this is just babysitting .
this is work .
but when you 're not . like now . what do you like to do ?
i 'm always working .
but like , what do you like to do when you 're not working ?
no , mikey .
hmmm . but , consuelo , even though your poor , do n't you have any hobbies or interests or anything ?
i 'm still poor .
must 've been hard being poor .
we had to work . my family was poor .
were n't there high schools in el salvador ?
i did not go to high school .
when i 'm in high school i 'm not going to play any football . i 'm just going to concentrate on class rank . what did you do in high school ?
no .
but do you really believe in god ? and heaven , hell and angels and all kind of stuff ?
it was god 's will .
wow . why did your parents have so many children ? i mean , if they were poor , would n't it be better to have just one or two ?
four brothers and five sisters .
really ? how many ?
yes .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , mikey ?
consuelo ?
i do n't know . maybe they 'll like it .
what 's an audience going to tell you ?
well , i need to see this with an audience !
we 're not ready !
hip alternative types who will understand the process better
we 're not ready .
ok , then we can invite serious intellectual types .
i dunno , toby . we really have a long way to go . you still need a lot more footage , and it 's probably a little premature to start screening
ok , you 're right , you 're right you know , we need to screen what we 've gotinvite some regular people , just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this .
i mean , why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ?
nothing , i guess
you 've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what 's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ?
no , no , no . no exploitation . this is seriousbut do n't you find it a little funny too , at the same time ?
i mean , without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .
yes , i knowbut still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
this is entertainment you 're making , toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .
you think so ? you do n't think that this might not be a little dry ?
this is definitely better .
thanks . i 'll tell mike . well , it 's still just a beginning . i know i can ... dig deeper .
the camerawork 's nice .
yes , i do . i love them !
no , you do n't .
you 're showing how superior you are to your subject . toby no , but i like my subject . i like these people .
i 'm not making fun . i 'm showing it as it really is .
well , i 'm not really sure what you 're trying to say . it 's funny , i suppose . but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are .
so whaddya think ?
550 verbal , 520 math . and i 'm only in fifth grade !
what ?
i was looking through scooby 's sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests . guess what score i got ?
yes , mikey ?
mom ?
boys , take napkins ... napkins ...
twinkeys !
i 'm serious ! what happens if he blows up the school ?
do n't even joke about that !
of course , honey . come in bed with us . come on .
sure ! ...
he 's right .
look , we 're not suckers . everyone else is out there doing the same thing .
it 's all about who you know .
you know , you have to . sometimes you just have to , toby .
we used pull .
do n't worry , he does n't mean money .
not to be crass , but what do we get out of this ?
you started filling out your college applications yet ?
marty ...
got a lot of homework ?
steak 's really good tonight . scooby good .
the sats , knucklehead . scooby i 'm not taking them .
what 's tomorrow ?
ready for tomorrow ?
fine .
hi , scooby ! how was school today ?
but then , in a sense , since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europe ... if it were n't for hitler , none of us would have been born .
well ... yes . if it had n't been for hitler , he would n't have had to leave europe . we would have been ... european .
how was the class ?
we did the same thing last year also .
i dunno .
what are you going to do ?
my cd case like totally collapsed . i 'm gon na have to recatalogue all weekend . hey . can you pass the salad over .
is everything ok ?
was anyone in my room today ?
i admit it - i was scared ! i was shocked , in fact , by what he said . and he 's so ... convincing . i 'm sorry if i let you down , but really , i still say he 's just one opinion . i do n't even like his books that much . they 're all so aggressively confrontational . i do n't care if he 's won the pulitzer prize .
well , i sure did n't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered .
that 's not fair ! i was honest ! just because i was n't sucking up like that bitch catherine .
patronizing fuck ! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i would n't have read it . i knew it was shit . but - idiot ! - i believed you !
marcus ... you 'll write something better next time !
your story was terrible !
you know he hated my story also .
what the fuck are you talking about ? what 's ok ?
do n't be so upset . it 's ok ...
what do you want ?
look , vi , i do n't blame you . you feel you feel pity now . the pleasure is n't there any more . the kinkiness has gone ... you 've become kind .
i was never much of a sweater . you know that .
you 've lost interest ... you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex .
marcus , i 'm tired . that 's all .
you 're tired of me . i can tell .
you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . anyway , i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral .
so you do n't want to hear my new ending ?
i think you should leave it the way it was . it was good .
but it wo n't make any sense if you hear it out of context .
well then , maybe you should just read the ending .
well , actually , it 's the same , but longer . i think it 's better . more ... raw .
oh . what happens now ?
well , i changed the ending a little .
you mean , again ?
i can read it to you .
huh ?
hey , you want to hear my short story now ?
... but mr livingston , are n't you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism ?
i think scooby 's like a lot of kids . he just hit aa speed bump . now he 's gon na find his way , his path is gon na be cleared , and i think he 's gon na continue his education at a good college . and everybody else is gon na be happy .
i have a cousin . very big giver to the alumni fund .
but what kind of pull did you have ?
yeah ... how do we know we wo n't be exploited ?
oh , i know , i know that . well , sharing your story , your ups and downs , and so forth , can i hope , be an illuminating experience .
'cause scooby does have a quality that i 've been looking for , a quality that is emblematic of american today . it 's part disillusionment , part hope ...
reconceive .
oh , well , i do n't have them yet , but
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds .
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this ?
you 're absolutely right . the focus is on the college admissions process today .
which is it ? you got ta keep your focus straight .
tired of this shit ...
ok .
do n't screw around with me . you know what i 'm talking about . you 're taking those sats . you 're taking those sats or your cd collection is history . you 're taking those sats and you 're going to college . you 're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair , but buddy your taking them .
whaddya wan na talk about ?
we have to talk .
yeah ?
scooby ?
man , it 's just , like , conversation .
get the hell outta here !
just the same .
the same . same as what ?
the same .
so ? how was school today ?
dad , i 'm trying to figure things out right now , ok ? it 's like , really hard , and i 'm just listening to some old elton john and ...
what do you know ?
whaddya mean you do n't know ? you either got a lot or you do n't . what 's not to know ?
i dunno .
i 'm going in there .
fuck !
sure , dad .
yeah , uh , listen . why do n't you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit ? i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment .
gee , you 're home early !
come here , give me a hug !
hi , dad !
hey , mikey !
ok !
hey , mikey . you wan na get some ice cream ?
ok. stay there . i 'll be right back .
yeah . sure go ahead . hypnotize me .
you 're welcome . dad ? would you let me try hypnotizing you now ?
thanks .
i do n't think there 's any hope , either . i was just trying to make you feel better .
mikey , there 's optimism , and then there 's stupidity . it 's a very fine line .
maybe he 's that one in a million !
one in a million recover .
dad ? do you think that brady will ever get better ?
yeah , well , mikey , listen up . cause here 's a lesson : life 's not fair .
mom , it 's not fair if brady can say the f-word and i ca n't .
maybe he 's building a bomb ... just like- !
i just want to know what the hell he 's doing in his room that 's so interesting he does n't come down for dinner .
nigger , fuck me hard ! ! ! ...
again ! !
nigger , fuck me hard ! ! ...
again !
nigger , fuck me hard !
say , 'nigger , fuck me hard ! '
fuck me hard !
'fuck me hard ! '

oh , bu ... uh ... i ca n't say that .
take off your top .
it 's a really nice place you have . is the rent high ?
thanks .
it 's over there .
thank you for being honest .
no .
oh . do you think i have a potential as a writer ?
i 'm not 'going out ' with catherine .
are n't you going out with catherine ? i 'm sorry . it 's none of my business . i did n't mean ...
maybe . she 's ok .
thank you . so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer .
you have beautiful skin .
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus 's story . it is a piece of shit .
that 's good .
good . 'cause i ... um ... i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was ...
you 're not .
can i join you ?
uh huh .
yeah , um , then ... are you alone ?
well , now you have .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean , i just did n't expect to run into you here , that 's all .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
hello , vi .
i dunno . see if i have any connections .
ah-hah . and how is it you hope to achieve this goal ?
well , i mean ... i wan na be on tv . maybe have a talk show or something . like conan . or early letterman .
c'mon . talk to me . tell me what you 're thinking .
i dunno ...
'ok . ' so you just do n't care . let me ask you , not as your guidance counselor , but ... as a friend : what do you want to do with your life ? i mean , what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have ?
ok .
all right , scooby , let 's not beat around the bush . with your attitude , you 're not going to get in anywhere .
i hate reading .
none at all ? how about those 'underground ' comics ?
no .
any books you like to read for fun ?
no , not really .
maybe she has caller id .
ok. bye .
yeah , sure .
listen , toby , i ca n't really talk right now . do you mind if i call you back ?
wow , that really is great . in a few years , who knows , maybe they 'll want to be in my documentary !
eight , six , and four .
great . how old are they ?
three .
how many ?
yeah .
huh . kids ?
yeah .
yeah ... so you 're um ... you 're married ?
oh . tired of 'life in the fast lane ' ?
yeah . but not any more .
yeah ... um ... so anyway , tell me . what about you ? i 'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies .
that 's good .
hunh .
uh , well , anyway , so i 'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia . kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology . i wrote to derrida to see if he 'd like to do the narration . but everything 's still kind of in development at this point .
well , but it was so long ago . we were so different back then ...
i do .
oh , i do n't remember that ...
yeah . you did n't wan na take me to the prom .
n-not yet . i 'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers . geez , remember when we were teenagers ?
oh ? anything i might have seen ?
i 'm a documentary filmmaker .
that 's good . so then what do you do now ?
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but , i mean , that was like - i mean , i have some dignity .
that 's too bad .
well , um , i kind of let things go on this novel i 'd been really into - i mean , the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt . i mean , really , it 's finished .
anything i might know about ?
yeah , well , then it got me writing , so that was a good thing .
oh , that 's too bad .
yeah , well , it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off , so , uh ... so i dropped out .
i believe it .
well , i went to law school , if you can believe that .
oh . so what did you do after you gave up on acting ?
oh , no , not any more . no , um , i kind of came to terms with myself , i realized i had done what i had to do . and it was time to move on .
um , well , yeah . so are you still acting ?
so . look at where we are : the year 2000 ! can you believe it ? i mean , did you ever think we would actually make it ?
yeah .
oh , yeah , well ... um ... i was just calling because , well , i was wondering if you still remembered me , which i guess you do ...
but ... you called .
that 's what i was gon na ask you .
so what 's going on ?
great !
great !
oh , fine . how are you ?
toby - ? oh , hi ! how are you ?
toby oxman .
who is this ?
hello , is this pam ?
hello ?
no , thanks .
you want some ?
i mean ...
yeah . i know .
you know ... i like you .
yeah ?
scooby ?
you should be .
i know . i 'm sorry . i 'm just ... a little nervous , i do n't know why .
i 'm not an idiot , man . i watch tv .
scooby , do n't ! be careful !
no , i do n't think so ...
is it loaded ?
i know .
gee , your dad 's smart .
it 's my dad 's he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet .
how 'd you get it ?
thanks .
pretty cool , stanley .
do n't be . your movie 's a hit .
oh , my god , scooby ! i 'm so sorry ... i 'm so , so sorry ...
oh .
yeah . he went to harward .
he did ?
uh , scooby , now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all , like conan o'brien , but did you know even he went to college ?
i dunno . i 'd like to be good at something . it does n't have to be tv . i mean , it could be movies ... anything . i 'd be willing to direct .
what is most important to you ?
thanks man .
sureumyeah , as soon as i have a screening i 'll let you know .
can i see what you have so far ?
uh , yeah , we 're getting there .
hey , um , toby ? i was wonderingis the documentary almost finished ?
200 verbal/710 math . kinda weird , i know . but i think they thought it was , like , good-weird .
but what did you get on your sats ?
prnceton .
so where 'd you get in ?
so like , yeahi caved in . i mean , i had to . my parents , they 're like still really depressed about brady . so i wrote the bullshit essay . filled out the applications , did the interviewsy'know , i figure i can always drop out .
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest .
whoopee .
actually , there is some interest from the sundance channel .
doubt it .
yeah , well , it 's possible they would be interested in it .
is this to like get into sundance ?
well ... it 's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine .
what for ?
well , no . i 'm doing one on high school students , in fact .
oh . you mean , like , blair witch project ?
no ... actually , i 'm a documentary filmmaker ?
you a pervert ?
times up !
well , i-i hope that -- that --
uh-oh ! do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point , or does washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games ?
y-yes --
does that include helen filmore , united states congresswoman ?
th-th-they 'll kill one hostage every hour until it is --
twenty-five-million ! and what will they do if the money is n't delivered ?
th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash -- or chemco will be destroyed .
henry , what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding ?
i do n't know -- look ! they can get in now , man ! we got no one left to guard it !
is he with the girl ?
there is n't anyone ! he 's opened that whole sector now !
well get someone down there !
we got trouble . that bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field -- just took out three on the north end !
listen man , i do n't need this shit --
i now understand the expression `` you get what you pay for ! '' a bunch of chumps !
i do n't know what hit us ! we had them trapped on the stairwell . they could be anywhere now .
i guess not cooper ...
looks like you 're not going to make that dinner after all ...
well cooper ...
well filmore --
rule two : without alternative , use yourself as a shield .
what about rule one : never let the person you are protecting out of your sight !
you 're talking about committing suicide !
because i 'll be firing at them .
they probably have guards on the roof -- and they 're gon na be firing at me -- not you ! atkins what makes you so sure ?
what are you talking about ?
i 'm going first . taking the fire . if we go out together we 're all dead !
there 's the fence ...
now what ?
used to filmore , used to .
you 're a lot like my father , cooper ... you think with your heart .
by the time i got back to the party our ambassador was face-down , in a bed of bloody azaleas .
what happened ?
i drew my gun , ran in the direction of the cries ... violating the first rule of service ... i let the ambass- ador out of my sight .
yeah ? ...
cooper ...
no but you did n't defend him either ! did n't want to rock the boat . guess the ride was too smooth . filmore i was acting under legal counsel !
let me tell you something cooper ! i never once bad-mouthed him during all those months --
what do you think ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
after leizburg , he stuck his neck out to defend me . he 's loyal to the end . even if it 's not -- politically correct at the time .
what do you mean ?
you should listen your old man more often . he 's got principles .
he 's a very stubborn man sometimes ...
i was n't angry with you i was angry with him .
forget about it .
what happened !
let 's move it we got company !
yeah and we do n't have much ammo either !
we do n't have time !
-- be prepared .
we 're outta here --
what now ?
who 's got matches ?
what are we going to do !
just the soda , please . cooper heads down the hall . filmore watches him leave , sighs , then turns and smiles at the general manager :
anything else ? maybe a sandwich ?
look cooper i do n't care what my father says , if you embarrass me here you 're going to regret it , understand ?
i 'm not arguing . i 'm just telling you what the deal is -- congresswoman .
just get me a coke and do n't argue with me , ok ?
if you 're working for me you 're going to do what i tell you .
i got ta keep you alive -- it 's in my contract .
what are you going to do , cooper , throw yourself on a bunsen burner ? it 's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab . we 'll be out in no time .
i said i 'll lead .
why ? are we going dancing ?
i 'll lead .
the maintenance hatch -- it takes us outside the building !
where does it lead ?
that 's it ! up ahead !
we would n't have made it out without you . filmore or without you .
it 's nothing to worry about .
how 's the arm ?
good ...
i do n't see why they would n't be .
are the labs in operation ?
we 're on sublevel six . we 'll pass some labs and then we 'll hit the stairwell --
how well do you know this place ?
even better .
i have a lighter !
i said i do n't want any , goddammit !
i insist ...
i do n't want any ...
come on , drink up .
shut up !
you see , it paid off -- you broke away from the old guard , congresswoman . it wo n't be long till they 're calling you senator filmore --
yes , you should .
i suppose ... you think i should thank you .
like where -- in your dreams ?
i know you 're not too happy at this point . it 's too bad we were n't able to meet elsewhere , under different circumstances ...
it seems to me we are just sailing away . they have n't sunk us yet , have they ? besides , do n't you worry your pretty little head about that . it 's all been taken care of .
you understand that they 're watching our every move right now -- you think you 're just going to sail away ?
you got it all backwards , helen -- but that 's ok , you work for the government ...
you 're going to pay for this ...
i hope you do n't mind all this -- it 's just that the networks will eat it up , you know ...
hey now ! no cussing on tv ! well in closing i 'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour . one is my perky co-anchor here , and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people -- people just like you and me !
go fuck yourself ...
i do n't know . if you gave me a reason to ...
are you going to kill us ?
enjoying the tour so far ?
you ca n't think like that ! we 're watching them like a hawk -- he 's bound to trip up , make one false move --
she 's as good as gone ...
looks like richter is n't acting alone -- he 's heading into some dangerous waters .
he 's in there ...
what about cooper -- where is he ?
chemco 's been developing nerve gas ?
why the hell did n't you tell us this was at stake !
we have a special forces squadron out of thailand surrounding the compound as we speak .
good .
we 've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions .
well ?
the transmission is an hour old ...
she 's still alive .
came over the satellite . we 're keeping the bird clear should they call back .
they were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time -- without anyone being the wiser ...
what !
he would n't take it on the helicopters . he 'd transport it through pipelines that connect chemco to the waterfront ...
how much do they have ?
well , it 's a binary formula -- a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work .
what the hell is it , anyhow ?
apparently , this project is -- unique . but it 's heavily protected -- all formulas are heavily codified !
i have n't been briefed on any such thing !
chemco makes many things senator ! we were under government contract !
mister myers it is a chemical plant ! there are a number of volatile compounds -- but they are safely stored away ...
is there anything in there that can blow ? we have to be ready for any contingency --
i assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it would n't be shelved in a lab somewhere ...
what do they have in there that 's so valuable ? a cure for aids , a cure for cancer ?
what do you mean ?
so , what are we looking at white ?
i do n't think you -- grasp -- the situation , mr. myers .
the ball is in richter 's court . but we 're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people -- we 're gon na stop the son-of- a-bitch !
and what exactly do they intend to do ?
i 'll let the senator tell you .
who 's ryan cooper ?
i 'm sure you 'll figure it out .
and -- of course there is the human cost , which is incalculable .
chemco is willing to deal with him , meet his demands . i can have the money there in an hour .
this was taken when richter was arrested in washington state , 1985. he was charged with interstate arms trafficking , skipped bail , and has since been a fugitive .
excellent .
we 're almost done piping in directly to the olympia . should have it all in about an hour or so .
what 's happening at the waterfront ?
you 're fucking crazy richter -- you know that ?
i want the girl . i do n't care about the rest -- but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy . we 'll make headlines all over the world ...
what are you so worked up about jack ? fuck 'em -- we do n't need 'em .
where the hell could they have gone !
excellent ... excellent !
kz ... 7-0 ... 7-0 ... nine . it checks out .
richter-we got a problem !
something tells me you do n't want to be on tv , friend .
i know what i 'm here for-you do n't need to remind me .
of course it 's codified ! each number probably corresponds to a compound . have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out -- that 's what you 're here for .
i 'm in to the directory but they 've codified the stockpile -- numerically .
have you broken it yet ? we 've got six more heads and that means six more hours .
we 're secured . takeover team is in position and accounted for .
how goes the roll call ?
the thing weighs more than a ton -- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it ? !
get your men to do it !
we ca n't -- it 's power driven !
drop the anchor !
if i do n't get power up we are !
are we adrift --
you know , when we reach kompong som --
dissent ?
well , there was uh , a little dissent about the amount of the bonus --
why should i worry ? is there a problem ?
my crew is going to work alongside with your men , do n't worry -- we 're a team !
captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request .
are you hungry ? we can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley .
agreed -- let 's move it .
i say we head out .
good .
gotcha . we 've been filling barrels all day -- we 've got hell of a stockpile .
our traveler 's insurance , you know what i mean ?
there 's enough in one vial ...
what does that mean ?
they must have got their hands on a test vial !
how much of this shit do they have , white ! !
of the separate chemicals -- i do n't know , uh , offhand --
we 've ... been developing a product ... kz 70709 .
just what the hell is he talking about ?
oh , yes , that 's right .
excuse me , mister president , but you forgot to give me my camera back .
we have many splendidly deep mines in our country .
goodbye , mister ambassador .
and now , mister president , i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier .
do n't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion , that in fact , you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require ? you trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and , of course , we are obliged to place the same trust in you .
and surely you do n't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons .
surely , you do n't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same ?
i know nothing of the sort !
that 's nonsense , and you know it !
bah ! all you wanted to do was spy in our country !
this dreadful accident could never have happened if your government had n't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control ! !
how dare you talk to me in this manner ?
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man .
damn you , de sade ! you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual , whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country .
allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people .
yes ?
the report is entirely untrue . i can assure you of that .
the source was ... shall we say , completely reliable .
that 's preposterous ! we have no such program !
but , finally , one factor tipped the scales . we received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one .
first of all , economic reasons . it was cheap . the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . it also seemed ideal in most other respects . it was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand .
mister ambassador , what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon ?
it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains .
where is this ... thing ?
our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices , jacketed in cobalt-thorium-g would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape . in ten months the earth would be as dead as the moon .
well , it has been explained to me that , if you add a thick cobalt-thorium-g jacket to a nuclear device , the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years .
i 'll hold this , if you do n't mind . you can have it back when you leave .
i am sorry . sub-miniature photography is my hobby . it 's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative .
what 's the meaning of this ?
did you get that , kulnick ?
if he 's not there , try ... 87 - 43 - 56 .
at his office in the capitol .
where are you trying to reach him ?
yes , of course .
i have your word , mister president ?
do n't be ridiculous .
the food - you would n't put - anything in it , would you ?
now , mister ambassador . in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone . i intend to tell him exactly what has happened . i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him .
thank you , admiral .
moffo !
possibly some coffee ?
certainly - how about some breakfast ?
can i have a glass of water ?
all right , mister ambassador ! but you must treat general `` buck '' schmuck with the respect due him .
war-mongering bully ! do n't think you 're going to intimidate me !
you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people .
please be calm , ambassador de sade .
one , two ... three , four ... five ... why you , dirty , stinking ...
that 's right , fella .
my seven body orifices ? ? ? ?
see ! see , i told you .
please , mister president , i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation . here is the only other camera i have left .
it 's not a he , general . it was an article in the `` times '' about a year and a half ago .
you mean you 'll tell us his name ? ? ?
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source ?
ah , but if we were able to untrigger it , that would be defeating its purpose . all our enemies would have to do , would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions . we would bluff , naturally , but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it . now we can say : there is no point trying to intimidate us , we do n't control the doomsday machine .
then all you have to do is untrigger it .
you 're absolutely right . we would n't . no sane nation ever would . that 's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically .
mister president , i ca n't buy this malarkey ; they would n't set the damn thing off . why should they ?
naturally . it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country . but this way we know it 's safe , and we do n't have the problem of delivering it .
do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ?
what do you think of this , mister president ? i told you we should n't let him in here .
give that back to me .
i caught you red-handed , mister ambassador .
do n't you dare touch me ! what the devil do you think you 're doing ?
mister president , are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ?
premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie .
who the hell do you think you are , sir ? ? ?
now , snap out of it , fella !
it might still be worth trying riki-tiki- tavi . r ... t ... t ... there 's only three combinations of -- t ... t ... r , or t ... r ... t ...
get a grip on yourself , major !
the three-letter code group . or maybe some combination of the three letters . p ... o ... e , or p ... e ... o , or e ... o ... p ... let 's see , there would be six possible combinations .
what are you talking about , major ?
i think that just might be it ! although it could be riki-tiki-tavi .
why are you saying that phrase over and over again ?
come in ... come in ... peace on earth ... peace on earth ... yes ...
major ? ... major ? i 'm colonel `` bat '' guano , 701 battalion .
colonel , remember , a reprimand from the president can be pretty serious to a career officer ... just a second , operator , i know i have it somewhere .
that 's government property , major .
operator ... how much would the call be station-to-station ? ... thirty-five cents cheaper ? ... i 'd still be short twenty cents ... just a second , operator ... colonel , shoot the lock off the coke machine . there 's bound to be enough change in there .
well , i 'm general ripper 's executive officer . he 'll want to talk to me .
so what ?
he wanted to talk to general ripper , did n't he ?
what about the president ?
wait a minute . the president ! ! that 's it ! the president ! ! !
you 've wasted enough of my time , fella .
okay , colonel . but look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . maybe that works , huh ? maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ?
on your feet , fella . i 've got to get outside and see how my men are .
look , colonel . maybe it 's too late . maybe they 've sent air command in already . but we 've got to try to con- tact somebody .
now look , i 'm picking up this ordinary telephone . see ? ... hello ? ... hello ? ... nuts , the lines must still be disconnected . the general had us disconnect ...
sure ... sure , colonel . now look , i 'm picking up the phone ... nice and slow . right ? ... hello ? ... hello ? hello ? ... hello ? ... gee , it must be edad . probably the lines were hit during the fighting .
okay , fella . but just move slow and do n't do anything that might surprise me .
look , colonel . you keep me covered , but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to air command headquarters . okay ? ... i wo n't play any tricks on you ... okay ?
they told me , major . and i did n't hear anything about any atomic attack .
did n't they tell you ?
you must think i 'm an awful sap , major . just sit down , fella , and keep your hands on the desk !
look , general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with h-bombs .
sure i do . there was some kind of mutiny on the base , and you killed general ripper .
colonel , do n't you know what 's going on ?
do n't worry , major . your rights will be fully protected .
look , colonel . i 've got to talk to somebody at air command .
we 'll have to leave that up to the c.i.d . boys , wo n't we , major ?
look , i did n't shoot him !
what happened , major ? some kind of private beef between the two of you ?
what ?
do you have any witnesses , major ?
well , you ca n't do that because he 's dead .
i did that for your own good , fella . now i 'm not going to pull rank on you . when this is over , i 'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing . right now my orders are to locate general ripper and put him on the phone with the president .
now look here , miss pietraszkiewicz , this is air command headquarters calling .
ceida pietraszkiewicz ... p ... i ... e ... t ... r ... a ... s ... z ... k ... i ... e ... w ... i ... c ... z .
what did you say ?
ceida pietraszkiewicz .
what is your name , young lady ?
i 'm sorry , sir . general schmuck is asleep and he is n't taking calls until eight-thirty .
well , that 's the funny part of it , too , sir . it does n't show a damned thing .
does the threat board show anything ?
i know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones .
well , that 's ridiculous . if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order , just pick up a phone and pay for a call .
then why bother me with this nonsense ? get in touch with the base commander .
no , sir .
colonel , you 're not drunk , are you , man ?
general schmuck , we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base , hq 843rd wing . it was apparently directed to their wing on air- borne alert . it decoded as - wing attack , plan-r .
i did n't say anything . what 's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour , colonel ?
what did you say , sir ?
go back to sleep , baby .
yes ! who the hell is this ?
general schmuck ?
yes !
i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you to take the film out .
just a second , sir . he 's got films of the war room in that thing !
buck , when i told you to give them right up to the top , you said we could n't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he 's a psycho .
be fair , mister president . did n't we initiate the human reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons ?
damn it ! damn it ! i 've been telling you all for years you 've got too damned many psychoes in the service .
not exactly , sir . you see , colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago . he asked general ripper if he had issued the go-code and the attack order , and general ripper said : `` sure , the orders came from me . they 're on their way in , and i advise you to get the rest of air command in after them . my boys will give you the best kind of start , and you sure as hell wo n't stop them now . '' then he hung up .
you are n't sure !
to be perfectly honest , mister president , we really are n't sure .
may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the 843d bomb wing did a thing like that ? ? ?
yes , sir . he issued attack orders to --
general schmuck ?
well , sir , about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders , general jack d. ripper , sent out attack orders to the thirty-four b-90 's of the 843rd bomb wing , under his command .
what kind of trouble ?
well , mister president .
yes , sir .
i want him upped to brigadier general , and recomended for the d.s.c .
i did n't speak to him , sir . but colonel `` bat '' guano was in command of the special service battalion , so i would imagine he did .
that certainly would be a problem , sir .
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper 's planes start bombing their targets ?
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt , mister president .
you see , you knew the answer all the time , general .
well ... i suppose penetrate the base by force .
under the circumstances , general , what would you think they should do ?
thank you , sir . but what shall i tell them to do if they are denied entrance ?
that 's a very wise deduction , general .
well , sir , they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base .
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies .
under a condition red alert , the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops .
yes ?
yes , sir . one thing , mister president .
and lastly , all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded . they can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs . air police will have lists of all owners .
yes , sir .
now , as soon as you 've done that , double- up on all base security teams . our enemies are plenty smart , and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs .
thank you , sir .
you 're a good officer , major , and you 're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention .
no , sir . i 'm just bringing the facts to your attention , sir .
are you questioning my orders , major ?
general ripper , if i shut down the communi- cations center , there 'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with air command head- quarters or anyone , for that matter .
as soon as you 've done that , shut down the communications center . lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details .
no , sir . plan-r to be radioed to the wing .
are you hard of hearing , major ?
plan-r ? ? ? ?
i hope not . now , as soon as you do what i told you , have plan-r radioed to the wing .
no , sir .
are you trying to be insubordinate ?
to you , sir . but how do i know ?
who do you think you 're talking to ?
yes , sir . i just thought of something , sir . how do i know i 'm talking to you now ?
no calls at all . with or without my say-so . my voice can be imitated too , major .
i understand , sir . nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so .
no calls from inside out . no calls from outside in are even answered . no calls .
you 're right , sir .
we do n't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the president down , do we ?
that 's right , sir .
let me worry about that , major . i 've still got my red line to the air command .
yes , sir .
major , that 's all i 've been told . just got it on the red phone . the base is to be sealed tight . and i mean tight .
but ... what kind of a shooting war ? have they hit any of our cities yet ?
yes , major . this looks like it 's going to be it .
a shooting war !
you 're a good officer , major mandrake . you have a right to know . it looks like we 're in a shooting war !
yes , sir . what 's up , general ripper ?
that 's right . i want this flashed to all section immediately .
condition red !
all right , major . i 'm putting the base on condition red .
yes , sir .
good . has the wing confirmed holding at x-points ?
no , sir .
youddo n't think i 'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important , do you , major ?
i do n't know , sir . we just spoke a few minutes ago .
why do you think i ask ?
certainly , general . why do you ask , sir ?
do you recognize my voice ?
yes , sir .
this is general ripper speaking .
combat operations center , major mandrake speaking .
major , i happen to believe in a life after this one , so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done . i think i can .
general , now that you 've done that , i beg you to recall the wing .
peace on earth .
to peace on earth , major .
yes , sir . why do n't you stop the fighting , sir ?
major , those are my boys out there dying .
major , i hate to say this , but i think you 've been enemy indoctrinated , and you do n't even know it .
look , sir . i 'm no expert on the subject , but i 've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have . like , say , both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors . you ca n't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it . and if i were going to try and hide a few , i would n't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob is n't going to run and blab for a million bucks . we 're as smart as they are , and if they cheat , or even hold back information , we 'd pull right out .
do you think they would cheat ?
no , sir . i 'm sure we would n't .
do you think we 'd cheat ?
general , what 's good enough for the president and all the experts he 's got working on the thing , is good enough for me .
and you 'd like to see that ?
if they gave us what we think we need , yes , i guess we would .
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want , we 'd agree , would n't we ?
but , general , we 're on our toes . we have n't agreed to anything for years . inffact , a a lot of people say we never will .
i 'll tell you what i do think . if they say they 're for disarmament , i say anyone who says they 're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool .
do n't you think he knows something about this , general ripper ?
do n't be offended , major . our president holds the same views .
well , i 'm not , sir . honestly , sir .
major , you 're talking like one of them !
gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world .
no , major , i do n't . they have no regard for human life . they would n't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won .
well , for the same reasons we do , sir . do n't you see ?
i still ask , why do they want disarmament ?
well , sir , i remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99 % of the days of the year , given average luck it would fail in thirty years .
go on , major . you fascinate me .
that 's right , sir . and do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . what if they start something ?
i 've heard the arguments . like napoleon 's quote , `` there 's one thing you ca n't do with a bayonet , and that 's - sit on it . ''
i was just going to say , as long as the weapons exist , sooner or later something 's going to happen -- and that 'll be it for both countries .
go on , major .
well , sir , like i said , for the same reasons we do . i mean , all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident , or a mistake , or by some mentally unbalanced person --
then do n't you realize the bomb gives us peace not war ? and , if that 's the case , i ask you again : why do they want disarmament ?
right .
but war does n't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right ?
i do n't know , sir . but they 're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are . war just does n't make sense any more , for anybody .
but we mean it because we are a peace- loving country . are they a peace-loving country , major .
yes , sir . but so do we .
you 're very naive , major . do n't they say they want disarmament ?
and i guess they wo n't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country .
not yet , major . not yet .
well , i know they 've been going on for years , and they have n't gotten any place .
where ? everywhere , major . everywhere .
where , sir ?
major mandrake , i guess you do n't follow what 's going on too closely , do you ?
but if you just let things alone , we would n't lose anyone .
you 're absolutely right . you forgot to mention their nuclear subs . but it would n't matter . sure we would n't get off without getting our hair mussed , but we 'd prevail . i do n't think we 'd lose more than fifty million people , tops .
but even then , we would n't get everything . i mean some missiles would abort , or they 'd miss their targets , or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we do n't know about .
i know so , major . i know so . and add to that , the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they 've got .
i guess so .
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy , would n't they ?
i suppose we might catch them off their guard .
you 're being dense , major . i certainly do n't
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people , sir ?
that 's close enough , major .
well , i think i remember reading the report on that . was n't it something like a hundred and sixty million ?
if we have n't taken any further action , they certainly will . doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack ?
but when they do , sir , wo n't they hit back with everything they 've got ?
you see , major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the president in the war room . he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes .
i 'm trying to , sir .
when he said it , fifty years ago , he might have been right . but today , war is too important to be left to the politicians . do you follow me , major ?
i see .
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals .
i do n't think so , sir .
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war ?
no , sir . i mean i did n't think you had n't given it a lot of thought .
i 've given it alot of thought , major . do n't think i have n't .
well , general -- i was wondering , why are you doing this ? i mean why do you want to start the war ?
ask away , major .
general ripper , can i ask another question ?
to peace on earth .
what shall we drink to , sir ?
perfect . thank you , major . and now let 's drink a toast .
that about right ?
just a squirt .
how much soda , sir .
you 're damned right they are .
i suppose they are , sir .
we 've come a long way since world war ii , major . and the lessons we 've learned are all in plan-r .
i know that , sir .
do n't fret about it , major . there 's nothing anyone can do about it now . i 'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the crm-114 .
perhaps , major . perhaps . pour me a scotch and soda , please . and help yourself to whatever you like .
but -- why ... that would be an awful thing to do , sir .
suppose that were the case ?
because i thought it proper , major . why else would you think i 'd do it ?
but then , sir , why have you issued the order : wing attack , plan-r ?
and if that were true ?
well , i was thinking , maybe an enemy attack is not in progress ?
that 's a good question , major . maybe if you think hard , you can think of the answer yourself .
well , sir , i was thinking , if an enemy attack is in progress , how come the radio 's still playing music ? it 's supposed to go off , and all we should hear are civil defense broadcasts .
you know the regulations well , major .
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress , does n't it ?
that is correct , major .
well , general ripper , sir -- i was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ?
certainly , major mandrake . you 're a good officer , and you can ask me a question any time you want to .
yes , sir . general , can i ask a question ?
i did n't mean for anyone to play anyone else 's radio either , major .
oh , it 's not my radio , sir . i picked it up in the communications center .
i see you 're playing your radio , major . is n't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base ?
that 's right , major .
sort of like a new hobby , huh , general ?
please do n't take any notice of this weapon , major . i love all weapons , and as of late , i 've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times .
what 's the gun for , general ripper ?
zlat , make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices .
you 've lied to me twice - i 'm sorry , but it will be strictly routine . these men are experts .
well , sir , if the a/c 's a really good man , i mean really sharp , why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time . a real big plane , like a sting ray , zig-zagging in , its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard -- - has he a chance ? ... ..hell , yes ! he has one hell of a chance .
general , stick to the point , please .
if i can speak freely , sir -- look , these guys talk big , but frankly , we think they 're short of know-how . you ca n't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys , and i do n't mean that as an insult , mister ambassador . hell , we all know what kind of guts your people have . why just look how many millions of 'em those nazis killed and , hell , they still would n't quit .
is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy air defense , when its course and target are known ?
well , the premier doped it out pretty well . its primary is their missile base at laputa .
what 's the target .
yes , sir . we 're still sending it . but it 's a funny thing we do n't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all .
have you tried the recall again ?
well , sir , it looks like one aircraft , the `` leper colony '' , failed to receive the recall .
yes ?
well , just common sense , sir . thirty from thirty-four equals four , or my name 's not `` buck '' schmuck !
how do you know they were shot down , buck ?
hello , are you still there ? ... uh-huh ... i 'll be right back . we 're still working this thing out .
mister president , there were thirty-four aircraft involved . thirty acknowledged the recall . that makes four shot down .
look , he 's there , and you 're here .
well , if you choose to take his word over mine -- -
he says they 've only shot down three planes .
naturally i am , sir .
general schmuck , are you positive of your figures ?
general faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson ?
i 'm not certain , mister president . but i believe it was four .
how many planes did we lose ?
i believe it will be just a few minutes , at the most .
i 'm not certain , mister president . the boys in concom do the pencil work .
how long will it take to receive them all ?
they 're coming in now .
have you received acknowledgements from every plane ?
knock it off will you , general ? crudley , find out what 's holding up that call !
we do n't operate like you kgb boys .
that 's the idea , general schmuck . zlat !
but he 'll hear everything we 're saying . and if he just looks out of that window , he 'll see everything we 're doing .
admiral buldike ?
i do n't think that 's a fair analogy , sir .
but we ca n't communicate with the base .
i want to talk to general ripper .
general jack d. ripper , sir .
i should say practically none , though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination . the trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations , and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all .
then there 's no chance for recall ?
mister president , i know you think i 've let you down , but we had to have a plan-r. if we completely centralized the command and control , all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the capitol , and we 'd be out of business . we 'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered .
how could you let this happen , general schmuck ?
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes .
how soon until the enemy finds out what 's going on ?
mister president , to guard against espionage , the three letter of the code group for plan-r are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself , just before each mission . they are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy . in this case the deputy is air-borne with the wing , and general ripper refuses to recall the planes .
and i suppose you 're going to tell me you do n't know what the three-letter code is .
once the orders have been given , plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft . but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group .
why ca n't you cancel it ?
well , sir , plan-r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack .
what the hell is plan-r ?
yes , sir . the base commander , general ripper , selected plan-r ?
and i suppose there 's some reason why you have n't recalled them ?
that 's right , sir . but the planes were at their positive control points , ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final go-code .
well , what about the positive control , the safety catch ? do n't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order ?
i 'm afraid so , mister presient . being part of the air-borne alert , each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece .
i presume the planes are armed ?
it was a honest mistake , sir .
ca n't help it . what 's the wind like ?
you know what that 'll do to our fuel consumption .
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level .
all right ... we 're still flying . i 'm taking her down to the deck .
i do n't think so .
thanks , binky . can you see bromdingna island yet ?
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes .
lothar , take your checks now .
roger , maintain .
roger . one-three-eight .
i 've got the heading , major . one-three-eight .
roughly , one-zero-five . i 'll have it plotted in a minute , major kong .
give me a first rough course as soon as you can , lieutenant ballmuff .
no , they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise .
yeah , to see if we 're on our toes .
fifteen ! twelve o ' clock .
maximum ecm .
the dirty , stinking , rotten , sons of b 's ! ! they might have clobbered marge and the
he 's right . they must have clobbered some of our cities already .
they must have clobbered some of our cities already !
he 's right . we would n't have started it .
maybe it 's an exercise .
what else could it be ?
sure , i 'll take her up right now .
could you take her up right now , king ? other- wise we 'll get kind of close to the fireball .
sure , i 'll take her up to eight hundred .
well , listen , king . could you take her up to about eight hundred ? that 'll help you come in at a nice down-angle , and it 'll give us a chance for our chutes to open .
hey , terry , i 'm hit .
sorry , king . my leg 's stiff as a board .
hang on , boys .
i think they mean business .
if they come down low enough to make a firing pass , they 'll never be able to pull up in time .
they 're moving apart .
they ca n't touch us at this height .
must be mach two-five stuff . altitude fifteen thousand .
they must have made a visual contact .
fighters closing fast - range fifty miles .
roger .
look , ca n't someone help me ?
lieutenant quiffer , we 're all sorry you were hit , and we 'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away .
look , i 'm shot - it hurts .
come on , quentin , is n't that pretty selfish , putting yourself ahead of the mission ?
why ca n't he help me now ? he 's sitting two feet away from me !
lieutenant toejam , why do n't you help him ?
yeah , i got it in the thigh .
we 'll worry about that later . okay , i 'll take damage reports .
should n't be bad . might even help . but my guess is we 're going to have to paddle our way back .
maximum ecm !
twenty ! twelve o ' clock .
thirty-five , still straight .
call them every five miles .
between mach 3 and 4 .
speed ?
forty-five . still coming straight and fast . twelve o ' clock .
they must have been fired from bromdingna - probably one of their new vampire - 202 's . they 've got a range well over a hundred miles .
just the missiles .
roger , keep calling them . knock off auto-pilot , ace .
missiles ! sixty miles off , heading in fast . steady track , they look like beam riders .
zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary .
check .
missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens .
check .
main interference linked to electronic detector . fight interference on readi- ness state .
a through h is correct .
forget it , quentin . it can happen to the best of us . now let 's get squared away .
i 'm sorry , major kong . i guess i was way out of line .
war ?
war .
what ?
then this is it .
skip it and jump , damn you ! this flak 's so close , i can smell it .
listen , king , old buddy . on behalf -- -
forget it .
gee , we hate to leave you like this , major kong . but there is n't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around .
very interesting .
yep , it 's the crm-114 code , all right .
let 's see ... international morse , i think ... k ... e ... o ... p ... e ... r ... e ... c ... a ... l ... l ... m ... i ... s ... t ... a ... k ... e ... o ... p ... e ... gee , i do n't know , it seems to be some kind of code .
no kidding .
some kind of signaling .
what does it look like ?
damn you , lieutenant toejam ! lothar !
where 'd they get you ?
listen , i think i 'm hit bad .
so am i .
lieutenant toejam 's going to help you in a minute . can you check your ecm ?
i thought i should check out the damage first . my gear is busted up pretty bad .
primary arming switch .
primary arming switch .
ready , major .
lieutenant toejam , are you ready for bim and bam ?
primary target the icbm base at laputa . one weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand . second weapon to be used if first malfunctions . otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of karnak . fused air burst at ten thousand .
roger , i 'm setting up the crm-114 .
okay . check these points . complete radio silence . to ensure that the enemy ca n't plant false transmissions and fake orders , the crm-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits . the three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the crm-114 , which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters . you got it ?
yeah , it sure looks like the real thing , all right .
no , this looks like the real thing .
that 's what i 'm doing , and it comes out the same .
check your code again . no one at base would pull a stunt like that , terry .
wing attack , plan-r. that 's exactly what it says .
i just got another blast on the crm-114 , and the damned thing decodes : wing attack , plan-r .
yeah ?
hey , king . somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor .
well , i just wanted you to know how i felt . hell , i know air command would n't have taken you if you were n't okay . and do n't think i do n't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of negro descent .
sure , king .
i just wanted you to know i did n't mean anything by it .
forget it .
listen , lothar . you know that crack i made about your ... butt ?
thanks , king . i 've always wanted to take one of these big babies in .
i 'd be mighty proud if you did , lothar .
king , would you mind if i keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in ?
i thought maybe you 'd like some company .
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for , lothar ?
i thought i 'd go along for the ride .
what the hell are you doing here , lothar ?
we 're on course , major . just fixed our position on that river back there .
roger .
well , it would probably help if you took it ... sort of ... straight down .
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle ? i mean , do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger ?
i think it 's okay , king . they should go off on impact .
there 's no other way , boys . i 'm going to have to take her in ... the hard way .
let me check .
there 's no other way , lothar . can you re-arm the bombs for impact ?
but how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors wo n't -- - hey , king ... .you 're not thinking of -- - you do n't mean you 'd -- - ? ? ?
i asked you a question , lothar !
but i told you , i do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open .
lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ?
i tried everything . something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took .
have you tried the emergency system ?
but i get a red light .
maybe the warning system 's out .
well , i ca n't get out and look , king . but i do n't get a green light .
are you sure ?
well , i hate to say this , but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck .
i 'm okay . what 's up ?
it 's me - lothar . are you okay ?
who 's that ?
forget it . okay , team , let 's break it up and get ready for the kick-off .
sorry , king .
first lesson in war college : never under- estimate your enemy .
you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball .
we crossed the coast over an hour ago . okay ?
okay , how do we know they did n't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew ? how do we know that ?
come on , king . that does n't make sense .
nobody 's loyalty is beyond question . besides , how do we know one of his staff did n't see it ?
but the code is made up by general ripper , and he 's the only one left at the base who would know the code .
there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose .
then get off my back !
take it easy , major kong .
lieutentant zogg , how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back ? ? ?
look , king , maybe you 've lost too much blood , or something .
i said that 's the point !
i do n't get you , king .
that 's the point .
right . so how could we get any messages ?
the crm-114 is smashed , right ?
like hell it does .
then that settles it , does n't it ?
but the crm-114 has been smashed for almost an hour .
our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders . and therefore , to disregard anything that does n't come on the crm-114 .
look , this is different .
lieutenant zogg , what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission ?
how the hell do i know ? maybe the war 's over .
why should they call us back ?
they must have gotten it from the base . no one else would know it .
you tell me .
wait a minute , major . `` ope , '' that 's the recall code . where would they get that ?
well , we sure as hell are n't going home just because the enemy tells us to .
what do you mean ?
what are you talking about ?
i mean pulling a stunt like that .
what do you mean ?
you sure have to hand it to those guys .
no , i think it means , `` recall period mistake , '' and the ope is probably the crm-114 code . terry ?
recall what mistake ?
no , look ! it 's `` ope - recall mistake . ''
quentin , how 's your gear ?
i do n't know what we got left besides bim and bam .
listen , give me a shot quick !
he 's dead , all right .
hell , he looks dead .
how do you know he 's dead ?
in the back ... feels like an arrowhead .
where 'd they get you ?
sure ! sure , i 'm on my way .
i bit his jugular vein . now will you shut up and get up here ? ? ?
what happened ?
he 's dead .
ca n't `` ace '' help you ?
lothar , get up here fast , and bring your first- aid kit ! i 'm hit kinda bad , i think .
yes , major .
binky ?
everything still checks out okay .
let 's have a rundown on the damage , lothar ?
master safety on .
all right , lothat , that does it . master safety on now until bomb run .
primary bomb is live .
master kong .
master safety .
check , ten thousand air burst .
fusing for ten thousand air burst .
seond safety .
second safety .
first safety .
release first safety .
primary trigger switch .
primary circuit is live .
as soon as i 've checked over the route . about five minutes . all right ?
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary , major ?
check , all bomb circuits green . okay , lothar .
bomb doors circuit is green , bomb release circuit is green , bomb fusing circuit is green .
check target approach .
hellnno , major . i was just trying to think the thing through .
are you saying our order do n't make sense ?
well , if they hit us first , they 've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already . we 'll just be hitting empty real estate .
what 's your point , lothar ?
well , if there 's a war , they must have hit us first .
that 's what i said .
our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities , right ?
shoot , lothar .
i 've got one .
in about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar . cross in over the coast low-level , continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary , and climb for bomb run . any questions ?
certainly not , sir . when they go down into the mine , everyone else will still be alive . they will have no shocking memories , and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
but , look here , von klutz . wo n't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked , grief-stricken , and anguished that they will envy the dead , and indeed , not wish to go on living ?
when they emerge , a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable , if they are moth-balled in advance . i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years .
a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed , but off-hand , i should say that in addition to the factors of youth , health , sexual fertility , intelligence , and a cross-section of necessary skills , it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included , to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition .
but who would be chosen ?
it would not be difficult . nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely . greenhouses could maintain plant life . animals could be bred and slaughtered . a quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country , but i should n't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd . every nation would undoubtedly follow suit .
mister president , man is an amazingly adaptable creature . after all , the conditions would be far superior to those , say , of the nazi concentration camps , where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life .
but they could n't come out for a hundred years !
in a matter of weeks , sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided .
yes . the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep .
at the bottom of mines ?
you know , like , like , i would always think , uh , you know , what if i make the wrong move ? but maybe there is n't any right move . you know ? i mean , look at us . you know , we all dress the same , we all talk the same , we all fuck the same , we all watch the same tv . nobody 's really different , even if they think they 're different . `` oh , boy , look at my tattoo , you know ? '' and see , that 's what makes me freak . because i can do anything i want , as long as i do n't care about the result .
mm-hm .
you know ? and it used to scare me so much that i did n't know what was coming in my life .
yeah , i guess .
yeah , but , when i was walking , i realized that he 's stuck in that limo all the time . he 's stuck with his interviews , he 's stuck with his autograph , he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do , you know ? he 's not free . he 's just part of the machine , and if you think about it , freedom 's all that there really is .
well , sure , he 's rich and he 's famous . he 's got everything and you 've got nothing .
well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .
yeah .
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing . we were getting off on the fact that we 're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest . and i got out and i just started walking .
it was like hell with windows . you know , there 's shit on the walls . kids my age sucking their thumbs . i mean , every day i would , i 'd wake up in my cell and i 'd think , my parents put me here . why ? why ? because i stayed out all night one time . uh , because i broke the vcr when i was drunk . because i was out of control . i thought my parents loved me .
it was pretty bad , huh ?
yeah , it would suck big time . i 'd kill myself first .
i mean , that would suck if you had to go back to rehab .
no . oh , maybe . fuck .
well , you should n't drink . are you gon na drink ?
uh , ninety days . and now i just have to go once a week . see , i 'm rehabilitated .
how long were you in there ?
intense .
oh , yeah , you had to go to highgate . that must 've been intense .
rehab . outpatient . i have to go once a week . it 's kind of like aa .
in group ?
sure , all the time , in group .
did you ever hear that saying , `` this too shall pass '' ?
yeah .
you know , one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense .
knock yourself out .
can i have some ?
i do n't anymore .
i just walked all the way from westside to here . i have n't walked that far since junior high . i thought you did n't drink .
wait . racism ? you do n't know anybody who 's black !
um-hm .
`` burger manifesto , part one '' is gon na make people think ?
mn-hm .
alright . she told him to meet us here . fuck .
we are ?
i do n't know .
uh , well , what 'd she say ? is pony coming ?
uh , yeah , she should be coming by .
you did n't get me in trouble .
yeah , i talked to your mom . i think i woke her up . i hope i did n't get you in trouble .
uh , home , you know .
tim , he listens to you . do you think it 's a good idea ? seriously ?
typical male .
typical male .
typical male .
yes .
responsibility , progress .
i stand for something . and i 'm trying to communicate something .
uh-huh .
why is everything about you , jeff ?
it 's called `` burger manifesto , part one the dialectical expression of testosterone . '' is n't that a great title ?
behind me . i 'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff .
slides go with it .
what did you guys think ?
yeah !
was it okay ?
that was really great .
okay , whatever you want .
i do n't smoke dubes and i do n't really hang out . but i 'll go back . okay .
yeah , we could hang out and smoke a dube , you know ?
now ?
do you wan na go to the van ?
i do n't know . waiting , i guess . you know ?
yeah .
right now ?
mm . hey , what are you doing now ?
oh , no , it 's not . i mean , they 're not all totally in a coma . i mean , they know when i 'm helping them .
sounds like a bummer .
oh , some of 'em . but it 's mostly just strokes and shit . i mean , most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow . usually they die id they 're , you know , really yellow .
any gunshot victims ?
no , i , you know , i help 'em out . i empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch . that kind of thing .
your a nurse ?
yeah , i 'm a nurse 's aide at mercy .
you can see it . whenever you want . do n't you , um , work at a hospital or something ?
oh , that 's so amazing . i wish i could see it .
i was doing schrooms and i saw this cloud . it looks excellent on tape . the video is like my head and , and everything , you know , is , like , is like in there that i see . you know ? plus , i 'm gon na come down here one night and walk around inside the circle a with the camera and tape shit .
oh .
yeah . there was this cloud and i video taped it .
a cloud ?
a cloud .
oh . well , what 's it on ?
it 's really not about anything .
what 's it about ?
yup .
hey , you said you did a video ?
no i quit .
hey . do you have a cigarette ?
hey !
yeah , when 's he coming ?
yeah , we all want to see him . so when 's he coming ?
no , thanks . i do n't drink . um , well , what 'd she say ? i mean , did she talk to him ?
want a beer ? is pony coming ?
alright . 'bye , buff .
god , tim lied to your ass , man . that guy 's sad , man . well , uh , i got ta go , but , uh , listen , if i do n't come back , i 'll send a video of me surfing . alright , man ? get some rest . go with the flow .
no .
see , i was n't making shit up , man .
guess not .
ow ! hey ! get the heck in there ! hey ... not dead ! definitely not dead !
it 's bullshit . look ! look !
let 's go look , then . let 's go look , then !
yeah , man .
oh , really ? you wan na go look ?
that 's bullshit . that 's total utter bullshit .
no , no , no .
bullshit .
tim killed erica . tim 's a murderer .
tim ...
look , tim confessed to me last night .
she 's dead ?
she 's dead .
what ?
buff ...
what she doin ' in the van , man ?
she 's in the van .
hey , man .
look .
what ?
erica is in the van back there .
wait . hey , man .
no . it did n't , buff .
y- s-sure it did .
buff , you got to stop making shit up . it did n't happen .
yeah , i saw all of erica last night , man .
wait a minute , wait a minute . you saw erica last night ?
no man , she showed up last night at the hotel . we has a great time together . i stayed in her room last night , man . what can i say ?
what , they 're looking for her ?
yeah , that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . that chick erica ?
you know ?
i know , man .
no , shut up ! look , look , alright , tim is in trouble .
oh , and guess who showed up .
buff , can you listen to me for a second ?
but i 'd , i 'd do it for free . you know , just for my reel .
buff , listen to me . could you just-
because since i 'm just starting out , i 've got a fresh point of view , and that 's good for , you know , marketing , demographics ...
no .
no , i know what you 're going to say . i do n't know anything about making a video . but that 's a plus .
okay , buff , listen to me for a second alright ?
yeah , we all stayed at the four seasons , man . it was party time . hey , i hung out with danny , pony 's manager . really nice guy . we talked about the video . they want a raw look . something fresh . danny said if i can capture the reality of burnfield , it 'd make a great tape .
no , look , this is not about sooze , alright . wait , wait , wait , wait . she stayed at the four seasons last night with pony ?
i feel really bad about that , but i was busy , you know , i mean ...
no , no .
yeah , i should 've stuck up for you , man , i know . you 're my friend , she 's your old lady .
uh , last night ...
yeah .
buff , look at me for a second . no , this is serious .
hey , you know me .
no , i mean , no one .
sure .
uh , buff , i 'm , i 'm , gon na tell you something and , uh , you got , you got , you got ta promise not to tell anyone , alright ?
good .
no , i 'm not worried .
no . life is too short .
no , i 'm not , i 'm not worried . i 'm not worried .
she was at the four seasons last night , man . but you should n't worry about that .
no , no , i was n't trying .
yeah . get ahold of sooze ?
no .
hey . hey . are you trying to get a hold of sooze ?
huh ? no , alright . well , you know what we need ? a hot cop of coffee . hand on . ohh , hey , i was up all night too , man . a long , long , long night .
no , no .
hey ! whoa , you look like shit . you been home yet ?
in the limo ! ! !
you know what ? go with him . just go with him .
fuck it !
so you can do an album cover ?
you know what we should do ? go to the ...
... idiot ! open the damn door ! go , go , go , come on !
go !
so , we 're all old friends of pony 's . we go way back to our childhood .
so , do you guys want to do something , go someplace or something like that ?
okay .
a long , long , long ...
okay , okay .
a long , long , long , long , while .
watch out for that tree .
yeah , a long while . a long , long while .
i 'm saying no , i 'm saying after a while it 'd wear thin .
ah !
no , i 'm not saying that i would n't love it .
oh , come on , man . tell me you would n't love it !
that sounds so depressing .
same , more of the same . yep , just keep doing the same thing all the time , around and around the clock . with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy . then , instead of watching gilligan , we 'd watch captain kirk .
that sounds so great , man . yes . yes . hey , what would you do in the afternoon ?
i would n't . if i were in his shoes , every morning i 'd get up singing , man . do my work-out , take a shower , followed by a hearty breakfast , steak and eggs , washed down with a pot of hot coffee , six pack of coors lite . then i 'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe , who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit . so i 'd , like , have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude . except she 'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em . and then she 'd take out this half-ounce of blow , we 'd snap out a few mondo lines , vaporize a few million brain cells , screw for about an hour , then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan .
i 'd get bored .
oh , yeah , yeah . wait , um , how do you figure that ?
you know what ? he probably gets bored with all that shit .
oh , right . oh , oh my god ! pony , it 's so huge !
no , he 's not with a girl .
you wan na bet he 's with a girl ?
jesus christ .
sorry .
buff , buff , buff , buff , buff .
oh , i 'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video . oh , oh , pony , come on , give it to me ! stud ! oh !
no , no .
that 's the rock star thing .
no , i seriously doubt that pony 's gon na be in a limo .
the dude wants it .
do n't let 'em fight .
yes !
i do n't know . later . i do n't know .
yeah , no , it was n't even my idea .
pony 's coming here to the corner ? !
he 's around and , you know , maybe he 's coming by . sooze told him to come by and hang out , whatever . it 's no big deal . me , him , and sooze are gon na ...
but , so , pony 's comin ' by here to the corner ?

'' my duty as a human being is to be pissed off . jesus christ , not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place . nothing ever changes , man . fifty years from now we 're all gon na be dead and there 'll be new people standing here drinking beer , eating pizza , bitching and moaning about the price of oreos , and they wo n't even know we were ever here . and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there 'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they 're doing on this fucking planet and they 'll all be full of shit . it 's all so fucking futile .
yo , your gettin ' me all upset here .

jeff . jeff .
i do n't know . i would 've done something . this is kind of hypothetical , is n't it ? this place is so stupid . i ca n't believe we 're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism . with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh ...
how ?
i would 've stopped it .
okay , what would you have done .
yeah .
oh , yeah ?
okay , but nothing happened . believe me , if i thought something really bad was going to happen , i would 've done something .
it got that close .
it was just something that got out of hand . did anyone get hurt ?
it was a racial incident .
tim !
this is ridiculous !
okay . well , you know , he 's always been a nice guy and i like him .
like i 'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start .
um , because you did n't want to go .
well , if you love him so much , why did n't you go see him play ?
i ca n't wait till pony gets here , you know ? have a conversation with a human being ?

mister brooks has had shows in new york , jeff . he 's been reviewed in art forum . i think he knows .
no , no , no . y-you know what ? y-your packing your bags , you 're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age , so he tells you you have talent .
i do n't want to hear it anymore .
`` the worst i can do is starve to death . '' listen to you .
i 'm not doing it anywhere , jeff . it 's just part of my application to the school of visual arts in new york .

w-wait a minute , wait a minute .
of course it does .
well , i , i did n't say i was special , but it 's one thing , you know , and it 's another thing to actually communicate it to people . you know what i mean ? if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it , does that make a sound ?

what ?
yeah , well , that 's what i do too .

sorry , kansas ...
hey ! rule number one - never take off the mask ! y'hear me ! no matter what happens , never take off the mask !
look , it 's really not my fault .
this is great - great ! now we have to enter the front door !
i just pulled and it - it came off .
who are you - the goddamn bionic woman ? !
you have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wan na run up and down the stairs . shit - i forgot to pick up the cigarettes .
i ca n't believe your grandparents never come down here .
you piece-a-shit bug zapper !

conan went to harvard .
forget it . i 've got a scholarship to harvard hanging over my head . i wo n't risk it .
and you know real cops are n't half as smart as keanu .
kansas is right . we 're like sisters -- we 're closer than sisters . and you do n't turn your back on family .
cleo !
i 'm in , too .
you just became a statistic !
holy shit .
bye .
thanks , cleo . see you tomorrow .
di ? i just called to say that conan talked about us again last night .
hello ?
i personally think of how conan started as a writer , then became a ...
my fault - what do we do that enables us to be as great as we are ?
use the bathroom , because the port-a potties on the field are gross .
hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out . heee hee-haaa ... .
is jack upset that he ca n't be here ?
it 's off ... i ca n't take the fighting , the back-stabbing , the open hostility . we 're not acting like cheerleaders , we 're acting like a bunch of sorority girls !
di , we 're sorry . we ...
well ... uh ... they , y'know , uh ... they had nicknames .
cleo , i 've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie ?
... he slices off the guy 's ear , and i mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
everything 's fine . i 'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down .
di , are you okay ? we can skip the girl party this week .
wayne gretzky .
another sex dream ?
i 've got to get that . relax . i 'll see you tomorrow .
what ? ! that 's insane ! ! ! why would i go to the police ?
she thinks you went to the police .
di , it 's luce . kansas just called and said she 's going to `` fuck me up ! '' then i heard coughing , a thud and kansas had to go . i think her grandma had another heart attack . anyway , why does she want to `` fuck me up ? ''
that 's right . practice makes perfect . i 'm practicing to have a baby right now . if we do a practice job , we 'll not only get the experience , but also the extra money we need for guns !
-- we practice ! sorry , cleo .
hee-hee-hee , haaaaa-that 's it ? hee-hee hee ...
okay , even with all our savings , it 's still only six hundred fifty-four .
of course - of course ! hands in ...
but , we have to make a smart plan !
well ...
so then this is n't crazy . it 's a sure bet .
... i do n't know . probably not .
if you do n't - can you still afford to go to harvard ?
no .
that 's right . so all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes .
and they get caught !
c'mon , luce , people do it in the movies all the time .
look , i might be moody . i might be gassy . but i am perfectly sane . think about it . in school , they tell us , `` dreams can come true . '' right ?
oh my g-d , i read about this ! it 's called a `` pregnancy insanity . '' quick , she needs a sitz bath --
`` positive '' you 're sure i 'm not fat or `` positive '' i 'm ...
positive .
you sure ?
oh g-d , i 'm sorry ... you 're not really fat ! i was just saying that because , uh , i thought that 's what you wanted me to say .
no i do n't ... i keep asking because i feel fat .
look , you 're fat , diane . you 're fat , fat , fat ! because you eat , eat , eat ! what ? ! she keeps asking because she wants some honesty .
no ... i 've been pregnant .
oh my g-d , you 've been robbed !
huh-ha-wha ? ahh ! i 'm under the ice ! i 'm uh -- oh ... man ... that was a weird one .
diane ? diane !
jus some girlie things for the squad .
oh ... what are you working on ?
that was gas , sweetie .
... so although their dad said , `` do n't get out of the car until i get back with help , '' they knew the sheriff 's voice as he yelled . `` run to my voice - and do n't look back . '' the twins did as he said , but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient , bouncing their father 's head on the top of the car ! ah ! they jumped , diane ! they jumped !
diane , there 's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins . now , if you guys were really friends , you 'd remind her to take these .
uh , jack - look , i can explain ...
huh ? oh jesus ...
if you reach for the stars , you 're bound to get -- mm-jack , pull over .
mmm-hmmm ...
i never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch . baby , we are living the great american dream !
ah ! i almost forgot gas for the baby machine . i 'll grab your snickers and get a place in line .
i know , but that was before .
but we agreed your job is running the baby machine ...
jack , i think i should get a job .
me too ! will it ever end ? ! i love this lady !
trix ...
if you could be count chocula , frankenberry or trix the rabbit , who 'd you be ?
jack ...
like cocoa puffs . good . captain crunch . bad . shreds the roof of your mouth . i mean you hear , `` tricks are for kids ! '' and you think , `` i 'm a kid , i guess they 're for me . '' but your baby brain 's got no idea that fruit loops are , like , a million times better . i 'm going to save our kid all that pain .
but di , all this food reminds me of how much i want to teach our baby .
jack , sweetie , i 'm only eating for two .
oh , jack ...
diane , i 've loved you ever since i first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head .
i sure do .
y'think ?
so , while we 're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty `` stinky '' - in the long run , we 're going to grow strong from this .
yeah .
i see a flower . and y'know , even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt .
spit from your dad ?
well , if i had to guess ... i 'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who 's going to be a daddy of his own ... jack , do you know what i see here ?
i do n't know ... and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table .
... so when your dad said , `` i never want to see your `` f-'in ' faces again ! '' do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up ?
excuse me , vendela , have you seen diane ? we 're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight .
hi , jack .
sorry . my hands are tied .
... do not accept charity . we are two young , able-bodied americans . we do not want a handout . we want a hand-up . give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow . give us corn - the kind you plant , not eat - and we 'll grow our own food and ... and , uh , then cut it , and - uh , y'know eat it ! now , if you 're interested in giving us a home loan , i will sit back down . if not , have a nice day , ma'am .
uh , yes . yes you did .
no . wait ! did i say promise ! cross-my heart and hope-to-die , stick-a-needle-in my-eye we 'll never miss a payment ? !
let me explain something ...
what ? ! but all our paperwork 's there . my school records , jack 's football records ...
i 'm sorry .
for a pack of cigs ? i use her food stamps .
do n't use big bills !
just call me later . i got ta get some smokes for grandma .
yeah , hold on .
that you ?
she 's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning .
remember , kansas , every time you point a finger you 've got three more pointing back at you .
it was lucy ! lucy went to the cops !
he ikea 'd us .
oh no ...
hee-hee-h-wait a minute . hold on , now . what do we do before a big game ?
hey . eyes on your own belly !
we were told you could `` fix us up . ''
no ! wait ... um ... we 're the a-squad from lincoln high ? so , uh ...
oh - okay , we ai n't done with this ... those babies are gon na get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load ! we 're gon na learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals ! i 'm gon na visit my mom !
oh , thank g-d ! i 'm not just super fat !
di , it 's not your fault . we all wanted to do this - for you ... for ourselves .
it 's all my fault . i 'm sorry i ever started this ...
i 'm sorry , diane , but i 'm not gon na watch my dreams fade away 'cause the virgin mary here thinks she 's gon na get ideas from kiddie movies --
kansas !
lucy , do you know for sure you 're going to get that scholarship ?
shut up .
and if the o.j . trial taught us anything , it taught us that in america , you can cut off someone 's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money . your mom only shot a guy ...
stop , you 're gon na make me cry .
listen , kansas , i know you dream of springing your mom some day ...
you sure i 'm not fat ?
uh , `` no '' ... you 're not fat .
`` no '' you 're not sure or `` no '' i 'm not fat ?
he is the great one ...
hat-trick ?
we 're here for you , diane .
madonna .
i 'll just ask the question myself ... `` is jack bartlett interested in me ? ''
nope . sounds more like the first .
well , i want to know what happened --
anyway , last time i checked , you still had to have sex to have an orgasm . and i know she ai n't seen the lord on all fours - so i 'm just saying .
wrong number nooooooo !
ooops , that 's me -- got ta run !
no . this is diane . i think you have the wrong number .
kim-lo ?
hello ?
oh thank buddha it 's you , kim-lo , i 'm being held against my will , my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call ...
yeah ?
fern ! c'mere ! she 's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose .
you 're kidding .
my daughter 's always dreamed of bein ' a cheerleader . put her on your squad and i 'll give you the guns .
oh , why did n't you say . for two-hundred i got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back ... i 'll gift wrap it for you . the deal is fifteen hundred . cash . take it or leave it .
hey , hey , hey . c'mon you guys . obviously that 's a little more than our budget will allow . basically , we 're looking for something around two-hundred dollars .
right . that 'll be fifteen hundred - cash .
bullets ? no bullets ! oh my gosh , these are just to scare people . kinda like round-off , back handspring , whip back , double full . you never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you 've got it .
bullets .
ammo ?
okay . how much ammo you reckon you 'll need ?
well , we 'll each probably want one - so let 's make it five . five should do it .
i guess there 's an exception to every rule .
yeah ?
hold on ...
... my sunday school teacher says that in prison , women shove broom sticks up your ...
ooops , hold on a sec .
it was n't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they 'd lived ! oh g-d , i 'm gon na be someone 's bald bitch !
hannah , we 've ...
we 're dead ! they showed this prison movie to my youth group on sunday .
hello ?
that 's okay , hannah . it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies . sex - you can learn from movies . but robberies ? there 's no way .
look , maybe i can watch a pg movie ... i 'll just say i 'm counting dirty words for sunday school .
or that ! look , you guys , i just want to provide a future for my baby . i know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand . i could open that safe in my sleep !
or , i could get my own horse ...
and hannah , you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids sally struthers advertises .
do n't martha-fucking-stewart me ! if you do n't like it - you try being a pregnant teen !
you want us to help you pick up ?
i know , hannah . look , i 'm not going to get an abortion . i mean , i always planned to get married and have kids - i 'm just going a little out of order . kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself `` with child , '' unmarried , on a long road , with no place to sleep . 'course , that was a long-long time ago . but no matter what , she held her head high and said ... `` pappa do n't preach , i 'm in trouble deep . pappa do n't preach , 'cause i 'm keepin ' my baby . hey . i 'm gon na keep my baby . '' the great one ...
i-i did n't mean to say `` whore , '' diane . i just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head .
i-i 'm sorry - can someone else please run the ouija board ? it 's creepy , it 's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior , jesus christ .
... ja-ck b-ar-t-le-tt ... is jack bartlett interested in me ?
you damn well better ...
i 'll get them before `` touched by an angel , '' do n't worry .
then i 'll throw a few more treats on the plate . where 's my smokes ?
uh ... yeah , grandma . she does n't mean that . kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke .
you got that big retarded girl down there ?
thanks ! that 'd be great .
oh well , then i 'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals .
oh yeah , you caught us ...
are you girls talking about boys ? practicing kissing your hands ?
shit ! yeah , grandma . me and the squad .
is that you down there ?
kansas ?
screw lucy !
maybe we can make a deal .
oh please , we 've all got bright futures ahead of us - we 're not going to tell anyone . promise !
that 's itchy , alright . how many y'need ?
definitely old .
she did , did she ? how is the old girl ?
yeah . `` itchy '' sent us .
really ...
all of you !
bank branch !
bank branch !
all of you !
hey , i even took my parents ' foster kid money . phillipe 's gon na have to gather rice without pants this month .
do n't make me jerry lewis you guys for the rest .
'cause i will jerry springer you faster than you can say `` fat-assed lesbian ! ''
uh ... maybe ?
you sure you wan na go there ?
am i the only one who cares about this ? at least i watched `` dog day afternoon ! ''
i 'm only allowed `` g '' movies .
wait a minute . you watched the apple fucking-dumpling gang ? !
... so , while it 's a laugh riot for the whole family , and tim conway is just about as funny as they come , especially when he goes ...
but you 're not married .
oh my g-d ! i 'm not first !
hold up , hold up . any sentence that starts with `` at church camp '' ai n't leading to the big `` o . ''
yeah . this summer at church camp ? i 'm pretty sure i had , y'know , an orgasm .
well technically , i do n't think i 'm a virgin anymore .
hannah , in order to get real answers from the netherworld , you 've got ta have a christian virgin run the board . your kind is pure of heart - the devil wo n't dick with you .
wait , petunia . mommy 's a little amped up - did n't get her yard time this morning . mink ai n't my bitch . she 's a specialist ... in banks .
hey , do n't `` mouthy shit '' me - i 'm outta here .
what ? ! hush up , you mouthy little shit !
oh , jesus christ , mom ! like my life ai n't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you 're in here ? now i have to add , `` p.s . my mom 's a dyke '' too ?
kansas , i want you to meet someone special .
so you need my help ? oh my g-d , this is like asking me for help with your homework . hey , mink , c'mere !
i know , but we ca n't quite figure out how to , y'know , do it .
well , shit-fire , kansas , that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ...
i know - that 's what i said too . anyway , we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank .
before you ? whoo-hoo !
my best friend got pregnant .
gee , i 'll sit out this afternoon 's coffee talk . whaddya want ?
okay , you ca n't tell anybody .
now how the hell can i help you ?
your help .
my what ?
i do n't hate you . i need your help .
so could half the women in here . and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ? to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ...
they could kill you .
i know , but it keeps down the size of my can .
you should n't smoke so many of those .
thank g-d. i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man .
grandma and grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl . they did n't want you to break out and come kidnap me .
i want to help . i 'm part of this squad ...
what the hell do you want ?
stop it ! this is crazy !
i mean it . i 'm in . this is the closest thing to a goddamn family that i 've ever had . if one of us needs something , we all do .
virgin mary musta snuck that one in .
... and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm !
more proof god 's a guy ...
diane , it says here you 're going to have mood swings , uncontrollable gas .
action ! the scene starts .
roll 'em .
you 'll pardon me , norma ? why do n't you just sit and watch ? o.k . here we go .
we 're ready with the shot , mr. demille .
she got to be . a dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit . hold everything .
i hear she was a terror to work with .
of course you did n't . you did n't know norma desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen , with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster .
i did n't mean to --
listen , thirty million fans have given her the brush . is n't that enough ?
i can tell her you 're all tied up in the projection room . i can give her the brush ...
it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?
i 'm terribly sorry , mr. de mille .
i hate to think where that puts me . i could be her father .
i 've got to run along . thanks any- way for your interest in my career .
the accent ! i 've got it : this guy is in the pay of a foreign government . get those studs . get those cuff-links .
someone in the formal set , no doubt , with a ten-carat kidney stone .
i 'm sorry about new year 's . would you believe me if i said i had to be with a sick friend ?
walking out on the mob . what 's the big idea ?
do n't worry . she 's just a fan for my literary output .
wait a minute . this is the woman i love . what 's going on ? who was loaded ?
i 'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage .
i 'll take it .
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch .
i mean , could you put me up for a couple of weeks ?
sure , this 'll go on all night .
listen , artie , can i stick around here for a while ?
the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . budget only calls for three drinks per extra . fake the rest .
good party .
where 's the bar ?
say , you 're not really smuggling opium these days , are you ?
close , but no cigar .
judas e. priest , who did you borrow that from ? adolphe menjou ?
come on .
that was the general idea .
you 're going to stay , are n't you ?
let it ride for a while .
give me your coat .
i almost reported you to the bureau of missing persons . fans , you all know joe gillis , the well-known screen writer , opium smuggler and black dahlia suspect .
in a deep freeze .
where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours ?
hi , artie .
well , what do you know ! joe gillis !
goodbye , mr. gillis .
carefull those are dirty words ! you sound like a bunch of new york critics . thank you , miss schaefer .
i just think pictures should say a little something .
name dropper .
schaefer . betty schaefer . and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me .
this is miss kramer .
i 'm sure you 'll be glad to meet mr. gillis . he wrote it .
just a rehash of something that was n't very good to begin with .
nothing for ladd ?
it 's from hunger .
what 's wrong with it ?
hello , mr. sheldrake . on that bases loaded . i covered it with a 2-page synopsis . but i would n't bother .
nobody asked you to .
joe , i ca n't look at you any more .
look , sweetie -- be practical . l 've got a good thing here . a long-term contract with no options . i like it that way . maybe it 's not very admirable . well , you and artie can be admirable .
if you love me , joe .
come on where ? back to a one-room apartment that i ca n't pay for ? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not ?
come on , joe .
all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?
no , no ! i have n't heard any of this . i never got those telephone calls . i 've never been in this house ... get your things together . let 's get out of here .
all right . i 'll give you a few more clues .
no .
i 'm trying to tell you . this is an enormous place . eight master bedrooms . a sunken tub in every bathroom . there 's a bowling alley in the cellar . it 's lonely here , so she got herself a companion . a very simple set-up : an older woman who is well-to-do . a younger man who is not doing too well ... can you figure it out yourself ?
i did n't come here to see a house . what about norma desmond ?
her own movie theatre .
jealous . ever see so much junk ? she had the ceiling brought from portugal . look at this .
why did she call me ?
want something to drink ? there 's always champagne on ice , and plenty of caviar .
that was norma desmond on the phone ?
just look around . there 's a lot of her spread about . if you do n't remember the face , you must have heard the name of norma desmond .
whose ?
hers .
whose house is it ?
you bet .
this is where you live ?
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos ? that 's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week , and no taxes . careful of these tiles , they 're slippery . valentino used to dance here .
come on in , betty ,
i do n't know why i 'm so scared , joe . is it something awful ?
hello , betty .
you did .
what happened ?
of course i love him . i always will . i 'm just not in love with him any more .
why not ? do n't you love artie ?
i do n't want it now .
stop crying . you 're getting married . that 's what you 've always wanted .
why do n't you ? we can finish the script by thursday .
he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there . it would kind of save us a honeymoon .
from artie . what 's wrong ?
it 's nothing . i got a telegram from artie .
betty , there 's no use running out on it . let 's face it , what- ever it is .
what is it you 've heard . come on , let 's have it .
i just do n't .
why not ?
something came up . i do n't want to talk about it .
what 's wrong with you tonight ? what is it , betty ?
was i ? i 'm sorry .
hey , what 's the matter ... betty , wake up ! why are you staring at me like that ?
that 's it -- there 's nothing like being twenty-two . now may i suggest that if we 're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ... now back to the typewriter .
twenty-two .
that 's no shampoo . it'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs , like a brand new auto- mobile . how old are you anyway ?
it must be my new shampoo .
may i say you smell real special .
if you please .
three cheers for betty schaefer ! i will now kiss that nose of yours .
not once . what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun .
come clean , betty . at night you weep for those lost closeups , those gala openings ...
not at all . it taught me a little sense . i got me a job in the mail room , worked up to the stenographic . now i 'm a reader ...
saddest thing i ever heard .
should be . it cost three hundred dollars .
nice job .
third . grandma did stunt work for pearl white . i come from a picture family . naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star . so i had ten years of dramatic lessons , diction , dancing . then the studio made a test . well , they did n't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little . i went to a doctor and had it fixed . they made more tests , and they were crazy about my nose -- only they did n't like my acting .
second generation , huh ?
i was born just two blocks from this studio . right on lemon grove avenue . father was head elec- trician here till he died . mother still works in wardrobe .
what were you -- a child actress ?
look at this street . all card- board , all hollow , all phoney . all done with mirrors . i like it better than any street in the world . maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid .
that 's the trouble with you readers . you know all the plots . now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils .
it 's that old familiar story , you help a timid little soul across a crowded street . she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money .
i gave her some advice on an idiotic script .
i 'll say . this is solid gold .
oh , that . it 's from a friend of mine . a middle-aged lady , very foolish and very generous .
i 'm sorry . i do n't usually read private cigarette cases .
who 's who ?
who 's norma ?
constantly . no , in all serious- ness , it 's really good . it 's fun writing again . i 'm happy here , honest i am .
do n't you sometimes hate yourself ?
