that depends .
clear for pickup .
the third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming ...
he 's a friend . he 's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation . he 'd definitely had a few beers , but it 's not like he wanted to drive . we did n't know what else to do . it was n't my pot .
-- mr. lindgren .
what happened ? ? ! ! ! ?
they 're crucifying you out there .
you 're not like your sister . you could n't be like her if you wanted to .

i 'm looking for ... i guess you could say i just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special .
you were quick enough to get tom 's help when ...

fine as may wine .
this one looks familiar , but i do n't know . naw . there 's one came in today looks a little like this one but ...

i want to be the best i can .
rowan ...
thank you . i enjoyed the play very much .
no , i did n't have to .

transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd .
i just has a terrible thought ... what is this is all a dream ?
stone is their spokesman . you think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they 'd let him do it ? stone 's a disinformation flunky . the face that he 's alive says it all .
it 's called mummification . you 're dead when they do this
no answer . you have no passport and your embassy抯 out . how do you plan to leave the u.s. , mr lombard ?

i probably shall -- after i 've tortured you a little more .
i 'm not cranky . and that futon was not too big to carry myself-
thank you . you still think that he was ... .
sure , evan , why not ? you were the first person i really ever cared about .
you might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter .
it fizzled , baby . that 's the way it goes . but we had our times , did n't we ? it was n't all bad .
and there will come < u > another < /u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really < /u > there . and she will look back on this . and remember how good it felt . how easy it was .

what do you do when you work ?
no , no , no . you were doing fine , you 'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy , you 'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs , and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire . it wo n't do . it 's stupid and boring .

oh , charles is hardly ever with me . first it was separate rooms -- now we 're trying it with cities . what do people call you -- pete ?
well , i kind of tried once . it just seemed stupid , i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid , and kind of , uh , i do n't know , and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this , and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we do n't know what to do with all that garbage , you know ?

you 're kidding .
and what have you come up with ?
what ?
bad sportsmanship . a ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues . they just ca n't stand seeing the other fellow win . if these people would just play the game , instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders ! ! ? ... oh , no , i think that was johnson , air boss of the kitty hawk !

he does n't have one now . that 's the problem .
great idea . let me get some shoes . i 'll take you home .
i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought i 'd be greeting you as a national hero .

you 're firing me .
i have an excellent teacher . 'make sure you wear the uniform ' ?
how 'd it go ?

this is a whole different ball game , erin . a much bigger deal .
his . . . whatever .

if your memory was as long as your dick , you 'd be in good shape . how long since you almost went to jail for this shit ?
any time , sailor .
this is a dead end . you took us into a dead end !
i promise i 'll take good care of it .
oh my god , i remember this hat ... this was during your little old lady phase ...
benjamin , i want to apologize to you if that 's the impression you got .

yes ... yes , i ... can hear you ...
wait ! can you give us something go on , here . like who had access to the safe . what about this lovejoy guy ? the valet . did he have the combination ?
do n't wear a mask , eddie . you do n't have to . that 's turk , eddie , the man who broke your thumbs . only he 's not going to break your thumbs . he 'll break your heart , your guts . and for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you , 'cause of what you are . 'cause of what you have and he has n't .
or murdered , like nix .

if i make it through the day .
i should n't have mentioned it . we ca n't go there .
i can certainly think of one more !
`` dracula . ''
well , i was wondering if we could ...
and you 'll face that danger head-on . as if i could stop you . and you have my complete support in this matter . anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing .
what makes you so sure this guy 's gon na set up his own brother ?
i 've got to get back .
it happens to this piece of shit ...
cuba would be a small price to pay .
you said it . three-to-one should get you both ears and the tail .
there 's a vent shaft leading straight up .
i want to talk to you for a second .
she was taught to love the life of others ... but not her own . you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live !
santa carla has become a haven for the undead .
good , sir . and so , it seems , did the president - but we would like to have some facts ; such as , uh ... what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation ?
you ca n't sleep . come on , fran -- open your eyes . let 's get her walking . we 've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours .
who said i 'll re-enter in the pod ? i got friends out in space , ryan , friends willing to get me back unnoticed . thank god for deregulation huh ?
i heard .

erysipelas .
then let me run the show , general lee .

scott ?
how many do you need to sleep . really sheep ?

if he 'd just come out for the little league , the way i asked him , he 'd find out we touch all the time -- shove each other , slug each other , and just horse around . i 'm going to go get him --
is n't it obvious ? i 'm trying to seduce you .
marie lasalle is in the store ! here , she 's here , and now !

what it felt like was ... a series of separate , unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid , wrecked college boy , garbage man , civil service guy ... ... et cetera ... et cetera . every time i 'd leave a life , it felt good . whatever problems i was having were suddenly gone . i had no friends and i did n't talk to my family . the only constant , stabilizing force in my life was ... drugs .
i know .

a toupee that flies ?
no , wait here .
ehh ... i do n't know i mean ... .

he 's beyond our help . you saw him get bit . i saw him get bit . we all saw it . you ca n't help him . i 've got no one left to lose but you . i ca n't be alone again . we 're sticking together .

sleeping .
where were you last night ? i did n't hear you come in .
how do you do . my name is penelope ryan . this is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing -- and those who do n't .
edgar william jacobi , aka william edgar bright , a.k.a . moloch .
that 's okay .
that did n't sound like thunder .
so where are you now ?
what 's this about ?
must be exciting , beautiful place , beautiful people .
i did n't cook up a story . i had a source .
of course ! that 's what negotiations are for .
i ca n't believe i remembered that , although i suppose i should . i wrote it ... but that was seven years ago , and you 're quoting it verbatim . i 'm flattered ... i think . or frightened . what 's your name ?
i ca n't hold out any longer either , mr. deeds . being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair .
you know , nick , we ca n't lose .
you 're out of touch . cops blew him up .
and his `` you 'll never be a berserk if you lose your temper '' ...
do n't i always ?
your goddamned friend , he thinks the only reason i 'm with you is for the money .
got a bogey , boss ?
making sure nobody 's following us .
there is much in what i say , gray , and if you have any regard for your neck you 'll leave now and stay away from my house , my school , and from me .
he 's a < u > bum < /u > .
oh and i do n't because i have a children ? ! the problem is you 're too self-involved to ever be a mother .
the peter pan .
it looks like a renoir .

why talk -- it 's over -- it 's over -- it 's finished . you 've broken off negotiations . you did it . you 're calling them off . you had nothing on your mind all day , but manchester , -- manchester -- manchester . you do n't suppose for one moment that i 'm such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester .
i just found out about it -- but there 's a bunch of boy scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl . avril bay , thereabouts . chief went to dry them off .
did they find out anything when they questioned her ?
he 's an ass that 's gon na try .
but i did n't play with them , daddy . they would n't play with me .
i got a call from the f.b.i . the daughter of the chinese ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help . you 're it .
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way , i 'm afraid of him .
what ?
then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure .
for what ? !
no . it 's not that .
you 've never been on a plane .
i was n't scared ...
you do n't use shit ?
that was our apartment .

it 's silly , really . i mean , i 'd seen him at the office , obviously i 'd seen him , he 's the associate publisher , and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place , and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat , which of course he was allergic to , and i got his lettuce and tomato on white .

no one likes a dying man , my boy - because few know what death is . all we know is the terror of it . but you 're an exception , chauncey - that 's what i admire in you , your marvelous balance . you do n't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you 're a truly peaceful man .

i need something to keep me awake .
i ca n't move my arm .

bill-
edna ! come dance with me ! let 's be foolish tonight .
is n't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , von karajan , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no one 's heard from him since ?
too much glamor , huh . what 's in the bag - - monte carlo ? apes in kenya ?
yes , i did . it 's terrifying ! the police were at my house this morning .
well , fact or not , i do n't see how we 're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight . i ca n't see a thing ! let 's turn back .
yes , luis is a despicable twit . i hate him .
no .
that 's dangerous , you know .
about what ?
yeah , so what happened ?
he never leaves the beach , fat sam . never leaves . sits in that chair , he 's outta junk . then he suddenly gets up , he 's got junk . so where does it come from ? through the sand ?
you have a record of what happened in the operating room ...
what sort of references do you have ?
no , really .
no mushy stuff . i 'm running this troupe .
how do you do ?
... is that not true ?
don alonso de bobadilla .

three minutes , twenty-three seconds . if you think i 'm doing another ...
this shocking image of repressed femininity !
remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time ... ?
i hope you wo n't take this the wrong way , but i could n't help but notice ... that you 're a dead ringer for veronica lake in `` the blue dahlia '' .
kinda like men .
score ! yeah !
i was lucky in the order . i always been lucky killin ' folks .
she wants to kill you .
you 're in the records room .
the partner who spotted the lesion , walter kenton , used to work for benton , myers , in d.c. there 's a paralegal there , maria torres . she 's had lesions on and off for three years . she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids .
do you see any telletubbies around here ? ... do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? ... do you see a little asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it ? ... no ? ... well that 's what you see at a toy store ? any you must think this is a toy store , cause you 're in here shopping for an infant named jeb . one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person 's valuable time ...
we 're short one long boat too . come on .
all right -- give it to him !
what are you doing ... ?
sir ! i have to talk to you .
this is weird , mulder .
how far away 's the sub ?
he only appears to be inside the cage . the point being ...
bud , your sister 's a little older now and she 's naturally going to start going out with boys . ... in fact pretty soon -- she 's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here . that 's if she can learn to bake .
tsch , i know . a relationship , i think , is-is like a shark , you know ? it has to constantly move forward or it dies . and i think what we got on our hands is a dead shark .
not you . how quaint . how old-fashioned and quaint . is n't it , col ?
there are many things that can exert control over one 's life , good and bad . religion , greed , philanthropy , drugs .
not me . you work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement .
fuck the record . now you listen to me and do exactly what i tell you . start back ten yards and take off from here . not here ... or there ... but right here ! no excuses , seeger ! you are going to plant those legs here and then you 're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to ! you want jets ? then do it , goddamnit !
what happened to his wife ?
who 's jacob ?
it would n't hurt to hear the plan , i guess .
of course , yes . just what would you like to know , inspector ?

i 'm ... dying .
uh-huh . so what are you doing here ?
you do n't own him you know - you ca n't tell me not to see him !
unless you want the right .
oh , she 's growing up very fast . as a matter of fact , she 's six tomorrow .
i need you to go to miami .
i think i know her .
have you taken leave of your senses ?
you can sleep on the bed if you want .
you 're saying that i 've halo 'd innocent people ?
... huh ?
hello , adrian .
that does n't matter .
no . i 'm missing the game for you .
well you 're right , dude , i got to thinking . i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand --
uh yes , we 're cousins..distant cousins..
i 'm with don on this .
is n't it wonderful ? such a party !
alright , alright .
who ?
we try to be decent .
i need my case . it 's still in the back .
sold in marriage and half way to america .
if i were you -
yeah ?
i ca n't talk right now . we have some things to take care of .
fuck this , let 's get something to eat ...
you will know . when you are at peace ... calm ... passive . a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense . never for attack .
good . 'cause every time you start thinkin ' , we end up makin ' money .
really .
... one shot ...
i ca n't tell you the whole story . i. i took it upon myself . i ca n't say more .
everyone at work heard you .
10 % argon , 85 % nitrogen , 5 % neon ... and some trace elements .

why did he come out here ? what 's going on ?
i have the director 's word , there will be no action against them . you may go once we have the disks .
... okay . i 'll try .
that 's not the point .
and therefore ?
what point is that ?
... to see you .
where did you learn to shoot ?
he 'll do better than that . i 'll send him down to miami on business , you throw him a couple bucks on the side , and he 'll track her down .
and yet you 're gettin ' c grades . it 's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me .
i do n't understand .
some committee 's got it .

hey , mikey !

but after all , you ca n't take blood from a stone .
then explain it to me .
why not here ?
you want something to drink ?
my approach ?
logic . lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270 -- i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a --

he 's right . you 'll get my whole family killed .
charlie ?
no lightspeed ?
please ! do n't be foolish ! time is short . let me show you something . look at this syringe .
should n't be long . a couple of weeks maybe .
did you call anyone ? did you call her house to see if she got home ? did you call the masons ?
you 're beamen 's daughter . your last name is different . you married .
what do you want ?
do n't lie to me . do n't treat me like that .
how ?
well actually i was born in siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my dad .
i 'm not sure . it seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news .
telling you what ?
david --
well , is n't it ?
corporation can .
kirsty ? it 's very late .
soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour . he is proud of his job , and even more proud that it 's legal .

he appears to be ... standing by his horse .
it does n't mean anything . it was written before i went out there . before the ho .
skipper , sorry to bother you .
i-i could n't think where to invite you without taking risks .
what 's her problem anyway ? did she actually tell you you could n't see me ?
i saw the laser just before we started . it was fastened down securely . you do n't suppose what happened was an 'accident ? ' any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub ?
i ...
you 've been fucking somebody else have n't you ?
if you 're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway , maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes .

i lost twenty bucks .

well , no ... but ...
that 's a fact . what you do , boy ?
you still mad at him ?
it 's me .
and what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention ?
-- i 'm not here .
`` paranoia , insecurity , depression , changes in vision , feelings of losing control ; belief that you have a mental problem ... '' nothing about turning into a werewolf .
whoa . that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck .
dick , if you 're ready to do it now , i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen , while i continue on with jack .
i thought i 'd give you a hand since i kept you open .
you wo n't regret this , mr. shreck .
you can turn that finger around .
where are we going , merle ? are we going home ?

good . that was the plan . we could n't stand him and george needed help .
... long .
why should i ?
well ... yes ... i had a trailer . it 's not like i made him run along side of the car .
i 'm sure i do n't , alice . it 's something else -- something moody -- something sickly -- she could almost be irena 's child .
this is n't colonization , it 's spontaneous repopulation . all our work ... if it 's true , then they 've been using us all along . we 've been laboring under a lie !
peter parker , you have no idea what i did this weekend . or did n't do . it 's no business of yours either way .

i ai n't sure .
no frank . no prints .
oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
but , i 'm here .

woody ? !
spencer 's the key here . frida is in no way associated with him . and her blood has n't matched with any of the killings .
i just assumed she ran away . happens a lot around here . look around . this place is an invitation to run away .

kay , i 'm sorry ...

we should have another fifteen minutes at least .
i do n't want to put on some make up ...
whoa . . .
what do you mean ?
there 's a reception this evening . colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend .
listen , there 's an overpass coming up . i may lose you for a minute .
but that 's living like an animal ?
i 'm saying it 's not going to happen . not when the president is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him . he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and , quite possibly , for bringing them back in body bags .
where are you going ?
if he can do it , yes .
he survived ?
cut it out .
how about you , cutie pie ? ready for round two ?

not yet . 'love to bust my ass cause i 'm not in frigging mensa . i swear to god , it 's that kid milo , i told 'em so in the first place , but they did n't even wan na hear about it . let 's run a printout on card entries .
... like grits and butter ...
these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor 's yard . all we need is some kind of diversion and we 're home free .
here 's to my last week of freedom .
uh-huh . tell me what you think of this first .
do n't wear it out !
jim , i 've got to go . i 'm already late --
may i ask ... ?
now that you understand the situation more clearly , perhaps you 'd like to discuss the matter with the president
i do n't know ... like fifty .
ha ha . that 's very funny , buzz . this is serious ! !
speaking of feeding things , what about dinner ?
you 're an idiot .
what ?
hello , officer . is there a problem ?

good for you . congratulations .
wednesday next . frank looks across the room at jack .
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can , they 'll never make it down . he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks .
ask kiki . ask any woman . girls do n't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark , lonely street unless they 're with a man or expecting a man .
do you have a name ?
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet .
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another .
you tried .
you quitting ?
father jeremy and deacon john townsend of st. ursula 's , and our associate , maya larkin . secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified . maya is eminently qualified .
then i 'll find another ride .

no , doll , i listen to you . and if a deal loses money that 's not so bad either if it 's handled right .
you know you did !
is she all right ?
and not too expensive .
you will . i 'll see to it .
it just wo n't do , will it ? i go two and a half years without being able to write a word , and then , when i finally get started on something , when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again , you show up and start breaking everything in my house . it just wo n't do , will it ?

out the window ! something just flew by !
jake , is that you ?

which part ?
if you give me six to eight weeks i can redeem the mileage and then i can with you wherever you have to travel ... ...

general faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson ?
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night .
you 've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill !
no , sir . i think the flint ...
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum .
what are you going to do ? make me throw it out ?
what about cooper -- where is he ?
it 's fifty cents admission . it 's applicable to a purchase .
... against the computer .
that 's the guy you 've been waiting for all these years ?
look at these suckers -- no wonder we could n't get it off him .
yeah ... well , actually no ... sort of .
great , get in . we 'll switch off in a bit .
what 's this ?
sir ?
they do n't know . they were having some recreation deal out at knott 's berry farm and kristen was n't there when they got back to the bus and they could n't find her .
i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago . during a bout of pneumonia . i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days . since i was doing so well on the azt , we decided against telling anyone about it .
that 's why the key did n't work , they changed the locks .
is she dying ?
not you . some assholes on the elevator ... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what ? why the fuck they call 'm `` working girls . ''
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they 're most vulnerable .
`` the exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine . ''
just a dream . you should sleep too . you 're still not well .
harry , are we gon na build this thing or not ?
no . the pill will change all that . then he would n't have blamed me . we were just too young .
because ... i know .
you got a bet on the game tonight ?
it 's important - he knows the last chapter .
you were right about coming here . i 'm sorry for not thinking ...
coming about , then .
sorry ...
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago .
do n't call me that ! do n't call me anything !
course , if it 's later rather than sooner , i 'd hate to be you at six o'clock . you 've got a lot of explaining to ...
i told you to go on in .
quarter after one . why ?
you 're not helping .
no . then they were led by his underlings . but i knew he had come this time , from the ferocity of their onslaught , from their use of the fortress . they use up much of their strength to do these things . they are taking great risks .
we pushed it . we got lazy .
ca n't remember ? ... what do you mean ?
how are you , lou ?
you ! activate circuits 29 through w7 and start full power coordinates on exterior defensive systems :
full diplomatic courtesy , mr. chekov ...
i think it 's hawkins .
please be looking for me .
this is n't bumper cars , it 's brain surgery . you wan na work with us , you do it our way , understand ?
< i > promise me ... you wo n't tell her ... that i never fucked pat benatar. < /i >
so you did talk about it , huh ?
grace . i 'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim , if you feel up to it .
delacroix , i 'm glad you got your mind right .
it 's going to be hard for the kids when i tell them ... i 'd like you to be there .
that 'd be great .
about how pretty you are , pretty boy . maybe he 'd like to know --
yeah , that 's kind of crazy , ai n't it !
well , we can take my truck then .
sometimes .
sure as gravity . i 've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it 's nausea .
i see you found what you was lookin ' for .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do n't think at some point somebody might notice that she 's gone ?
bodega bay ? where 's that ?
dear me , the man is dense . this is a castle , is n't it ? there are tapestries ?
listen -- if you do n't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- i 'll do something drastic .
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee ? just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl .
bill , i heard what you 're doing . i think i should go along .
hey , you guys back already ?
no no no no no , pay her off . did you hear me ?
hanging on every word .
i got dibs on his hat !
right now ?
beautiful .
come on , i 'll take a break and we 'll all dance .
did you hurt yourself ? whatd'ya do ? step on a thumbtack ?
fuck you and fuck bowling .
yesterday . it all looked normal .
not much danger here , ma'am , i would n't think -- right here in the heart of edinburgh .
... what ? ?
she 's not gon na die .
well make a dog , make a parakeet ! i 'm sure you 'll think of something .
what was you saying ?
i 'll inform dispatch .
you said it , mister . i got ta go .
to failure !
no . what am i to do ?
well , i got to see her .
he ai n't offerin me shit .
it 's my project . what you 'd call my life 's work .
like cancer with a purpose .
i 'll tell you , bobby -- i 've been away for a long time . very far away .
no , wait , wait ! wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! what is your name ?
where you staying now ?
and nothing . he 's just feeling us out .
i know . i 'm sorry . let me refund your cigarette money , and we 'll call it even .
mr. gardiner , i have a telephone call for you . sidney courtney , the financial editor of the washington post .
my husband 's at the office .
go away from me .
why did n't his niece slap your face ?
you got her warmed ?
merle ? ... merle 's alive ? how do you know ?
gee -- i hope so . what 's all this ?
too late ? jody , it was an accident .
i 've seen it . it 's all pain .
m-e ...
you can hit me , if you want to .
give a hoot . do n't pollute .
i 'm so comfortable with that , walt , i ca n't < u > tell < /u > you ...
i still ca n't believe you missed the fucking team bus .
fuck you , clementine .
no , no ... it 's okay , mr. eddy .
don韙 jim .
hell no , the cranes are wonderful , okay , but i 'm not in this for whooping cranes . i 'm in it for cowgirls . if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue , then cowgirls become just another compromise . i want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl . better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised .
it tastes like fish .
you know , i saw your father this week about his sinus ...
oh ?
i 've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall . men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air . yet as powerful as they are , their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world . because of this , they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be .
good , you start tomorrow .
not now . we need air , not greetings !
i told you , i have a feeling ...
oh yeah .
we 're over our heads . mr. sulu , get us out of here .
what ?
so i 'm supposed to be ...
forget it , man .
of course not . they 're possibles . i 've checked them against bureau records , check them against your file . how did you get it ?
sure , i 'll give you a shot at it , but ganz is mine . you know , that big indian plays it for keeps ...
i know what you 're saying . and i 'm telling you i do n't trust him --
i told him if it was during league play --
... gim me some help ...
let me ask you a related question . we 've talked about the supply side , but what about demand ? what is your policy for treating addiction ?
i told you i 've never driven before !
what with ?
you heard it ?
no .
gallagher ?
what happened ? who 're you ?
i was her doctor .
you 're sort of a rude person .
just thought maybe he 'd like a little coffee with his saliva .
with all the blood i guess they did n't see the rig . guy had it under a wig .
makes two of us .
... to ensure our privacy . i need to talk to her . alone .
that might have been good enough in rome last summer . but it 's not good enough now .
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city . lotta tradition locked up in here . what do you think ?
come on !
just put it down .
he just let it explode .
whatta you got , telescopic vision ?
five years ago . november .
do n't take all day at that table , david lee .
how 'd you know they were --
not many .
well , that 's alright . i understand you . now , say the whole thing again , hello ...
i ca n't just walk away !
are these all of her previsions ?
because it 's not .
you should see my appointment book . it got crazy .
adam ... dumb question , but humor me . have you ever had sex before ?
is that him ?
listen . you have to -- finish me off . you do n't want me coming back .
-- last thing i remember were those four clowns shooting the movie --
what kind of luminous things , bud ?
we 've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times .
what does it look like ... i 'm collecting empties .
no ! no different ! the differences are in your mind . throw them out ! no longer of use are they to you .
i said i 'm not listening -- and i think , looking at something that firm , you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse ' would be well-advised to keep quiet .
well , i guess they do those things . well , i trust you had a good year .
that 's too bad .
yes , she would .
ah ! ah ! -- god no , do n't tell me you 're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
he is lifting stanwyk 's two attach ? cases .
mickey stops sawin ' on my leg and says , 'oh my god , i 'm your biggest fan ! '
what ? tony and china , together ?
frida , can we come in ? we need to talk to you . it 's important .
jade fox drugged her . how did you get here ?
ohforgodsake , get on with it .
danny that 's a real _bonehead_ thing to say !
who is this ?
i 've seen it .
how 're you feeling this morning ?
how do you mean ?
no , no , i love , it 's just , thinking you 're , you must be so sick of it ... well .
i could shoot your cousin eddie .
but i 'm not a killer !
no -- keep pulling , it 's moving !
just give them the facts . they can leap to their own conclusions .
something black ? something on its way to you 棗
's all right , grampa . you just kind a tar 'd , that 's all . somebody fix a pallet .
oh my god ! he ripped out his -- he killed him !
in his mind , anyway , and soon enough in hers . she had written him many letters of love .
welcome .
oh , i studied the guitar . i had to give it up . gave me calluses on my fingers . as an actress i ca n't afford to have a tarnished instrument .
jeanne ... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me , those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne !
they 're not costumes .
beth ? now you 've got beth killing people ?
no , i do not mind .
going over the wall . coming to bearing 065. everybody stay tight and in sight .
you will be a jehovah 's witness . i have a few `` awake '' magazines for you . you do n't have to keep her very long . a few seconds is all i 'll need . whatiya think ?
sounds like an amazing coincidence .
y'mean take off our costumes ?
no , i just know jack 's lying about what happened . he just seemed -- i know that kid , what he 's like inside . he 's a lot like i was at his age .
like silk ?
i thought so .
nobody knows who you are . make it look like a robbery .
yeah , i guess .
take a look .
yeah .
i know . you 're quite a celebrity these days . are you here because you have info ... about my case ?
naa..
your door was unlocked .
mr. carpenter -- what does velocity mean ?
and we will send you to whatever god you wish .
because you 've got nothing else to live for .
perhaps , that is true .
well , whoever she was , elois looked like her . so one night i walk into the club , and no elois . now the bartender was a wetback , he was a friend of mine , his name was carlos . so i asked him `` hey , carlos , where 's lady e tonight ? '' well apparently lady e was married to this real piece of dog shit . i mean a real animal . and apparently he would so things to her .
deal .
that 's very funny , that is .
i think it 's enchanting .
yes .
yeah , a little .
what was the nature of your relationship with dr. paley .
chill , winston , it 's me and charlie can see it 's me , so what 's the problem ?
you 've just said yourself , miss , we 've already stamped it . why should we stamp it twice ?
do n't let me slow you down .
now , what do you want ?
good morning .
well , if the rider 's nuts , the horse bolts . that 's the whole lesson right there . you have a good day now ... just ... keep on freeing yourself up .
take a few days --
i 'm all right . i 'm safe ,
what ?
and when , eventually , everyone discovers what transaction xj6 was really about ...
why would you get bent if i asked ?
i did n't say that . all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out .
what do you want us to do ? i do n't know myself ... but we 'll do something .
as i told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable . no one in guilder knows what we 've done . and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast . out of curiosity , why do you ask ?
this is the person ... you were talking about ?
they 're a lot stronger than i 'm used to .
cmon , cmon , cmon , that one to ?
it does n't matter . really . i think i can muddle through . okay - the story of candaules and gyges . king candaules was passionately in love with his wife - one day he said to gyges , the son of somebody , anyway - his favorite warrior -
well that 's not necessarily a bad thing is it ?
look you better put that blade away and get your head straight . i have to put the car in the lot .
here , practice on your arm like this .
who is this ?
miss . g-6 .
she started shrieking , you know .
i lugged it all over town !
visit from my father .
in fact , would it be safe to say , based on your general knowledge of this character , that he is already in the building ?
because it 's cheap like a budgie .
excuse me ?
eh ?
well ... let me see ... here 's the thing ...
you 're kidding , right ? look at these readings for christ 's sake . pg & e 's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells , on numerous occasions .
what do you think ?
the loran has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude . give me the coordinates and we 'll be there as quick as we can .
where is my lady 's lord ?
oh , all right . there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york . it was full of men from the united nations .
' ... i know , it 's none of my business . '
colwyn ...
never heard of him . thanks anyway .
now what do you want to talk about ?
what are you talking about ? i wo n't accept this ! get out ! god damit !
i do n't say he was a man like an earthman , but i 'd call him a close relative , for he was plagued by most of man 's ills . yet , fragile as he was , he came before you -- and was superior to you .
this shall be your cell , mary clarence .
you gave me the bad dreams . you left me behind ...
okay , give me the numbers .
promoting that action movie i did ...
i 'm a lawyer .
this sack of shit is called tin- tin .
uhh ...
eddie mack , that cop . and jeremiah . and even when he 's done , who knows . he wo n't be satisfied . just like that demon dog . feed it , and it just grows hungrier . feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more . who knows where it 'll stop . that kind of hunger ai n't never satisfied .
i 've had an extremely bad day , octavius . a sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures .
who does n't ?
wait till you see her , auggie .
george , we 've got sixty-one million dollars . it 's either here or someplace else . we 've got to put it somewhere . unless you want to launder it .
has he ?
oh my god .
wer ist da ?
who locked the door ?
i did steal a squirt of perfume . what do you think ? it 's clinique happy .
i pick up the kids , walk the dog , which by the way , carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap ... i play with the kids , take out the garbage , get six hours of sleep if i抦 lucky , and then it starts all over again ... and why is it that i always have to drive everyone everywhere ? i spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work ... i抦 sick of it .
right , right ...
in the meantime , you said we were gon na have some fun . so let 's have some !
you know i do n't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot ... your ex-wife 's doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just do n't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long ! jesus what did you see in her ? i do n't get it -- i just do n't get it .
morning , miss kubelik .
ok .
so you < u > are < /u > a man after all .
sadly , no . well except for the lint .
i think you 're full of shit .
you could train someone else .
who tied her down ? you or him ?
just the love in my heart .
why you 're just a girl . what do you do for a living you pack a shotgun ?
she did n't seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . one night we went to bed ... the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes .
it 's an experimental model . he does n't dare leave it in his car , for fear it will fall into the hands of competition .
how well do you know her ?
i ca n't stay on this show . i got ta get some answers . otherwise i 'm telling you , i 'm going to do something drastic .
i do n't know . sell it . it 's got ta be worth something . someone gave it to me . c'mon frankie , i 'm trying to make good here .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
i 'll never forget you for that , mr. luthor .
what does that mean ? you 've been thinking about the case ? or you thought everything out before you killed marsh ?
oh , i know . and then when our poor president gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed v.p . becomes the pres ...
... do you drive this , mr. chance ?
up the organization ! bastard .
you 're too kind . i 'm amanda .
would you care to join me for a little refreshment ?
nothing ... nothing .
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . they 're about to get squeezed . we ca n't let that happen . i needed someone who could get the job done , quick and quiet ... no screw-ups . i needed the best . the best . so , i pulled a few strings at the state department ... and here we are .
i love you so much .
not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar .
i am .
yes , i would . that 's why i asked .
mike wants it .
it was n't that bad .
look -- we 're under a lot of pressure , we 're tired , you 're not thinking straight .
perfect fit .
give me a bottle of beer .
a girl says she loves you , you say something .
you have one of these ?
well , thanks . we 'll call you when we need you again .
no .
are you the funniest person i know , or what ?
because i was driving behind the bus , mary . because i saw it . i saw it happen ...
ho ! ho ! ho !
yeah , it 's me .
do you see the kids ?
is this ill right ?
you know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it 's not loaded..
that 's some face they left hanging on you . you look like ...
this is how you handling it ? this is how you handling it ?
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies , huh ?
who are you looking for now ?
so how are we going to get this place shaped up ?
what did he say ?
ah , fred -- hello ... this is hartman --
the cops were all over my house . they 'll kill me for sure .
but it 's possible .
oh , madame , you 're just too sweet for words !
damn ! why you trippin ' like that ?
brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you .
i 've got a job .
no , tell me what 's so funny .
good news comrades , it 's better than we 'd hoped . lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it 's a piece of cake .
what can you do when you have to be a man ?
that is what you must discover . see what i am , my love . with all your power - see me , and know what i am .
i know .
i 'm afraid it 's not very frightening . they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally , as i understand it , one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people .
do you know what you want ?
... are you insane ?
what can i do for you , leonard ?
well , i 'm sold .
this just might be our ticket !
what do they need her for ?
hey , maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone .
let 's get away from here .
you 're lucky to get four words out of them in english . but if you were to walk through the jungle , you 'd hear them speaking the most elaborate french . those parrots talk about everything : politics , movies , fashion -- everything but religion .
he tried to burn dunbar to us . you do n't do that if you 're not involved .
but not for anything i did today ...
tripp .
no ... ... ... .i .
i 'll take you there .
not a book fair . i was signing autographs in a department store .
what about you ? you have n't eaten in days . how come you 're never on this side of the microscope ?
joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place , am i wrong ? you know , in my own place my name ai n't ratso . i mean it so happens my name is enrico salvatore rizzo .
its horrors , perhaps ! its darkest nightmares ! and to what end ? nothing but your own morbid gratification --
but it was n't a kenworth .
at the subway station , we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant does n't know about .
three thousand miles ? ... how many times does twenty go into three thousand ?
i just gave him my card .
there 's a catch . you 're supposed to wear 19th century clothing .
no .
who ?
he 's not herr mozart . call him papa .
why did n't moe green meet us at the airport ?
you know , you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it . that 's my advice .
alright , father , here it is . about two weeks ago i went to my cousin 's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath .
hey , you 're limping . did you just hurt yourself ?
how the fuck should i know ?
the honor is ours . may i introduce mr. kallenbach . he 's an old friend and his interest is in flowers . i presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked .
i 'm kind of tired . i think i 'd like to try and get some sleep .
shee-it , man , i ca n't say all that .
this could end up saving your life , --
just says 'wo n't . ' wait a minute . here it says 'the living are arrogant ... they think they 'll never die , so they refuse to see the dead . '
it 's ... an eagle ?
will he find us and kill us ? yes ... or one of the others . you know there 's only one place to go now ...
five bills .
hey , fuck all that , i 'm making a point here . you 're gon na make me lose my train of thought .
give him the manicotta , bobo . me , too .
i do believe you . that 's what i want everybody to believe . trouble is , it does n't look like an accident and you 're not here to tell me about it ... i need you to help me here .
we 're still venting trace gasses , gim me twenty minutes to plug the hole .
maxie says he runs a tight ship . i would n't fuck with him .
ant team six ...
happy ?
well , why do n't you share them with us ?
see you then . . . doctor .
look , dirt !
what ? i 'm sorry , talk .
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman ? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park ... ?
let 's retrofit the dish to another satellite .
there 's a way .
jesus , you scared me . what are you doing here ?
look , the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group . those that can shoot , protect the rest to his ride .
i know your work well , signore . do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours ?
look ...
thank you .
`` crewman # 6 '' ... call me guy .
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month . do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt , and try to fucking return it ?
yeah .
that 's a word you 're too free with lately , jabez , consarn this and consarn that ...
how many of them did he kill ?
only in the movies .
you told me bourne was dead .
what are you trying to do , eddie ? you beat him . you beat him bad . you wan na kill yourself ?

same time . what about you ?
taller ? what ?
i do n't think so . you need me alive .
such nonsense .
if you took the trouble to write it , then sure , i 'll take a look at it . but i 'm beginning to think that maybe there 's more to life than music . i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr. excitement ?
is that what he said ? well , he figured it okay this time .
i 'm having a very good time , too .
how was school today ?
please , really . i 'm not hungry .
funny old bird .
okay . sure . my grandfather . when he was seven , he shook the hand of an old guy , a war vet or something , who had once shaken president lincoln 's hand . made a big impression on him .
i love going to movies , especially at the drive in . i do n't think there 's anything more romantic than going to the drive in . i 'll let you get back to work .
i want that fucking radio !
my patience is at an end .
give me some credit . i got you this far , let 's go to the grand jury . this is never going to stop if we -

to collect my fee .
screw you , valentino . i have n't seen you swapping spit with anybody .
how are ya ?
yeah , that 's right . so now that you know , you understand why it 's important that we get it back .
in general .
i 'm sure . when you 've led the kind of life that i have , there are debts that must be paid . maybe i can balance the scales a little .
no thanks , mr. eddy .
that 's your decision . but when they storm the flat , throw yourself out of die window - do n't let them get you alive . i have poison on me , they wo n't get me alive either !
the sign of our partnership .

what does it matter ? women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings . they want to know why you 're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there 's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just ca n't stand it anymore ! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it ! and then they dump you .

oh --
stay out of trouble .

you do n't kill anyone .
now do n't josh . this is a very big day for you , paul . here . you just sit tight , and i 'll set everything up .
what the hell are you talking about ?
everyone in the theater is screaming . maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie . she eats her popcorn .
dr. mccurdy , what would cocaine do to someone in mr. marsh 's condition ?
that 's the point . he slipped up , and he 's desperate now . and that means he 's all the more dangerous .

i never heard of a 908 .
what is it , 97 days ?
fucking owl !
oh yes . i 've read it over and over again . this baby 's the real deal . daddy 's little angel . a paradigm of chastity and virtue .
somehow i do n't think he stabbed himself in the chest , then buried himself too .
please sir , do n't beat me up . i do have a kiss ticket , but not on me .
you know diane ... i 've been wanting to talk to you for a while now ... er ... a ... aside from all that joking around we do out there ... when you 're on ... i ... a ... i really ... think that you 're a terrific performer ...
i do n't want your money !

the bed looks like a dead animal act . which one is sables ?
you bet we is !
i have a confession to make . someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you , as a practical joke .
it 's okay , really .
he was a merchant marine ! he was a respectable man who obeyed the law , and followed the rules --
i did n't even know who i was writing to -- just someone with the same last name . she never talked about any family .
god , you 're so young .
i deduced it . once you walked in .

listen , johnnie , lula just called me . she knew you were in n.o. , so they left the city .
you were kind enough , today , to take my photograph .
i suppose it 's however society defines it .
here i am , patrizia . i 'm always here .
it 'll keep them fresh . if they get too dry , they 'll break . and you do n't want that to happen , do you ? tobacco is a plant , and it needs the same loving care you 'd give an orchid .
yes basil ?
she ai n't missing so much as she 's run away .
so the mask is part of the down payment too . must be a really big job .
look !
you do n't have to tell me jeff . we were a team , the two of us , a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer . the twin champions of lost causes , they used to call us .

i was thinking , maybe we should ask professor daitz . nobody knows this stuff better .
we are about to embark on a great voyage .

look , it 's just that something about him struck me as odd last night . he gave me this funny vibe . anyway , i called some friends back east . they do n't know of any architect named patrick healy and he 's not listed as a harvard alumnus .
it 's okay , raoul .
do n't worry . if i ca n't handle it , i 'll just kill everybody .
grammar .
alright , pony !
now , why n't you help us ?
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck .

by the way , i like the renoir .
things have been going pretty well between us , have n't they ?

you do n't have to be criminal . a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat . you 'll see him , stop him , and the guy will make a big scene . there 'll be chaos . and that 's when it 'll happen .
pop .
no ... no , i do n't think that 's necessarily true .
it wo n't stop . it 's not ever going to stop .
i do n't know ! get me out ! !
how much farther ?
if you 'd grant me a final favor , i 'd like the chance to explain myself --
yes . washington laid the cornerstone though -- wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by madame lafayette --
babe , what happened here ? look at you .
lucy 's going on seventeen now ...
everybody knows freddie miles .
temporarily .
we 're running it through the computers now . so far there 's no event or service that doubles back into both families . plus they were big consumers : snowmobiles , fishing trips , scuba , videogames , lots of routine medical and dental . it 's a haystack . what 's the other ?
i have no plans to call on you , clarice , the world being more interesting with you in it . be sure you extend me the same courtesy .
but the time is now . soon others will come .
i think i forgot the tent .
that .
what do you stand for ? ? ?
it sounds like you 're talking about a wild animal .
that 's it ?
six days ago , yes .
he has proposed to me twice .
ray , the a.t.f . guy .
you have to start getting into your character .
very noble . not smart , but noble .
wait a minute . how do you feel this morning ?
alonzo , you do n't need to go home .
what were you doing ?
could you ever conceive of going there , tom , and bringing him back ?
i 'm sorry , tron ... he 's ... he did n't make it .
i like .
are you in trouble over this , mr. crawford ? can senator martin do something to you ?
i need to do it .
okay . just step on it . just get me home .
there 's ten people on this whole island and they 're all gon na end up in this jacuzzi with us .
i said ahhh-dam stuff .
what 's that ?
zero emotional developments . total lack of compassion . a highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive .
you ever use it ?
i do n't care what they 're doing as long as they 're doing it way over there .
do n't see how . i think the public 's had its fill of this gangster stuff . no , trust me -- disaster pics . and air hockey .
mom , come out !
oh , well , i do n't wear a lot of jewelry .
you moved like they moved . i 've never seen anyone move that fast .
the address ? !
nooo !
no .
twenty .
hey ?
king was n't mexican , fenton --
i 've never met anyone like you .
well whatever it is , could you get your man to turn the tv down ?
dulcea ! that miserable , manipulating loathsome she-devil of a witch ! !
it 's not really something i think about .
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
twenty minutes ! ... who had tank duty ?
do you know them ? !
gee , i must have been shit-faced at your wedding , i do n't --
yes - if i ca n't convince sophie , i 'll never be able to see tatiana ... .
i like trees .
pull the car over .
you know what really excites me about you ?
joey got cut off before he got to that part . check it out . by this point , it 's already running at , what , twice the speed as when it started .
what 's her name ?
you can do anything you 've a mind to ... and bein ' a woman , you will ! that yours ?
i missed you to mr. parker .
hold on a minute .
i thought we had separate rooms .
why not just buy your baby a night light ?
where were you ? i called at 4:30 this morning .
i know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition ?
me , too . you have a paperclip ?
if you did , you never showed it .
guess he talked to you .
perhaps . if the pay is good .
yeah , i know .
well , you 've asked .
harry ! jack , i do n't want to be rude , but these men have brought a lot of money with them . glenda , you do n't offer a man like jack a drink in those piddling little glasses . give him the bloody bottle . now , where are we ?
i never know anymore .
our favorite hotel , honey ... i checked into room 930. odd choice ? huh ?
well , if there is nothing more , i suppose we 'll be leaving you now .
i put up new drapes , jake .
we have n't had a wilbur here in a year or so , have we ? we used to have *dozens* !
i mean where have you been ? nobody 's seen you around for a while .
yes -- but ...
just a shotgun , huh ? better let me take a look at that .
you better believe it , you sweet little thing . you better believe it ...
kiss the back of my knees .
some village in the mountains -- alethera , i think .
look at this . the lock is totally demolished .
yeah . it 's the alternator all right .
okay ! i was n't sure
and i have two choices . i can either fight the way things are , or accept them . see , i always knew i loved you more . did n't bother me . i always felt lucky ... a little amazed ... that such a vibrant , beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me ... and i guess i thought as long as i did everything right -- if i was the best husband i could be , the best father ... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us ... if i could do all that , it would n't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not ... i was n't asking for more . i told myself i did n't need more . but you do n't know how you feel about me . you do n't know ... if you want a life with me anymore ... and i do n't want you to come home until you do know ... ... one way or the other .
why ? are they what 's most important ?
he 's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century .
true .
i made a mistake . i 'll never make another one .
see that sign -- we retain the right to refuse service to anyone . i 'm not going to charge you for this session , but i do n't want to see you back here .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .

i hear you 're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract .
here . here we go . here 's to you , nick !
if it is n't here , why would he wear that stupid key ?
well , you 're a romantic , catherine , as are most musicians , and what 's more , about to be married ...
they 're what 's keeping me alive . you think you 're dealing with an idiot ? talk to me then .

lice ?
hell , i do n't mind this mission , sir , as long as there 's something up at ramelle for ...

i get real busy between two and four .
all but me ! i 'm a-stayin ' .
she 's my best friend . i got ta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds . i 've been in some bad relationships and she 's been there for me . she 's lonely . if pretending she 's a werewolf helps , then more power to her .

short range scan .

i wish i had your discipline .
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
victory is the same as defeat . it 's giving in to destructive competitive urges .

oh , jesus , really ?
that wo n't be necessary . addison knows how margo happen to miss that performance - how i happened to know she 'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town ... ... it 's quite a story . addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth . i had a time persuading him ... ... you 'd better sit down . you look a bit wobbly . if i play `` cora , '' addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print . a simple exchange of favors . and i 'm so happy i can do something for you - at long last ... your friendship with margo - your deep , close friendship - what would happen to it , do you think , if she knew the chap trick you 'd played on her - for my benefit ? and you and lloyd - how long , even in the theater , before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again ? no ... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned , if i were to play `` cora . '' and so much better theater , too ...
what ?
it 's my day off .
what about him ?

there was nothing in the atmosphere of the north star to put me on my guard ...
my script ?
a dozen times .
eighteen -- and a half .
here . this 'll put hair on your chest .

i 'm going to need an operation . maybe a couple of them . they have to wait for it it to heal first . then they break it again .
you burn in bell . you burn in hell and you deserve it -- you get the fuck out .

if you want that baseball jacket for your birthday , neil , learn to cough a little more realistically .
you realize ...
when ?
mr. gekko , i do n't think i can ... go on .
hold up man .
why the fuck would i do that ?
i do wish you 'd speak to brother . it 's true he 's been looking at those horrible little books again .
well i guess there 's no time like the present . i 'll go run a check on that room , just to show we go that extra mile for our guests .
so he could have gone out to the base , hopped the fence , dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack .
i draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls .
ricky ? ... that i do n't care they stole the contracts ?
martin , could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something ?
it was a trap . i 'm back at square one .

why did it take that long to get her heartbeat ...
it 's just that ... it 's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that , i --
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you wo n't face the fact that she was raped ... or seduced ... or that she did the seducing .
may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone --
don , this is my mother . mom , this is my boss , don palmer .
you 'll need an animal behaviorist , someone with unimpeachable credentials . i believe you already know sarah harding . she 's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers i bet she 'd be dying to prove on a scale like this . if you convince her to go , it 'll be a major coup . when she publishes , the scientific community must take it seriously .
there 's more ... as always . he 's reman .
... it 's inside and it eats and eats until there 's nothing left .
the scandal ...
i was on the team at school . i was never very good , though .
forty-fourth floor , and it 's very --

yeah ... i guess it does .
ma , when are you gon na give up ? you got ta bachelor on your hands . i ai n't never gon na get married .

i know it 's old fashioned , but it 's reliable . like us .
then who the hell have you been talking too ?
frances ! frances !
stop .
yesterday , i finally called the accounting office at mission control , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the ags-19 notification for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either .
wait ! stop ! do n't give them the satisfaction . i know it 's tough , but look at how far we 've come ! are you going to throw it all away now ? ?
now i am truly embarrassed . forgive me . i should not have asked such a stupid question . i know you are a very important man and ...
he told me he was dying of cancer . not true . that ranch you thought you were paying for in utah ? not true .
i 'm crazy about the kid and i got him into it . what do you want me to do ?
uh , probably , huh huh ... whoa , i think my life is like , flashing in front of my eyes !
that 's what the guy said .
she 's hormonal . right , june ? it 's just part of the whole process .

sir , no one wants to work . they say the boss has left .
i need it tomorrow . if i do n't show up for work tomorrow , i 'm fired .
... as young as they want , you mean . and i 'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i 'm six or six hundred-
with a little checking , i could get to believe you .
that was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon . we just barely got cleaned up in time to open .

i 've done the slut thing , david . it 's really kinda old .
you appear at his side out-of-the- blue , stay at his house , eat dinner with his family , it 's practically a first . you 're in the red-hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe .
no more stalling , captain .
i do n't want to intrude .
i ca n't say .
i do n't know ... .
superman ? ? ?

are n't you allowed to kiss back ?
there must have been someone else down here then .
what are you doing here ?
yeah , but you got to come the rest of the way on foot . leave your car and walk over here .
well , well -- yeah -- i got smart and thought i 'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting . i said , `` mr. president , about the monopoly investigation -- '' and he jumps right in and says , `` diz , if you were sitting in my chair , would you answer the question you 're about to ask ? '' he had me .
i 'm mad at you .

really , this is n't funny .
jesus christ , violet ! open your fucking eyes ! johnnie hates me like i hate him !

i do n't know .
i 'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face .
oh , all the great writers -- shakespeare , charles dickens , moby dick ... those people . each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents . it 's a magnificent set -- and only $ 33.50 per volume . right away you get great expectations for just $ 6.99 .

well , he knocked at the door . you see , i was expecting two -- uh -- two business associates .
guess you got ta go .

the incredible thing about it is , i 'm paying for her analysis and she 's making progress and i 'm getting screwed .
then he saw .
how 'd it go ?
but if it does .
yes .
now this i want to hear .
yeah , thanks . . . . i mean , really ! posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls . i mean , . imagine wasting a great reporter - -- uh , reporters -- on this . perry white and his sunday magazine exposes .

your sister wants to ask you something .
i saw my lawyer this morning -- i wanted his advice -- about the best way to handle it --
talk louder . i ca n't hear you .
hang on ... remember that cessna we saw at the pumping station on the haul road ? belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline .
no , i can reassure you on that point . valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you .
why ?
yes he did .
to your husband .
why do you always disrespect me like that ?
no .
not at all . captain renault 's signature is necessary on every exit visa . captain , would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa ?
she was only-
no you do n't .
mac , what about the suit compartments on this level ? can they be accessed ?

you know why . you already said .
how about this afternoon i pick you up from school and we go get ice cream ?
you 'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable ?
you lied to us , levi , you 're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them !
truman , stop it !

''
i 'm not interested . i 've already got a job .
without him . the guy 's so out of it he does n't even know it 's gone .
you see that desk ? _your_ desk ? you see the crap piled up on it ?
hon ... i did n't want to die , but really , this is fine with me . as long as i never have to wash dishes again .
well , if you could just come for the day . new york 's only a few hours by plane , i 'd have you home by dinner ...
yes
be my guest .
listen , lad , i built this kingdom up from nothing . all i had when i started was swamp ... other kings said i was daft to build a castle on a swamp , but i built it all the same ... just to show 'em . it sank into the swamp . so i built a another one ... that sank into the swamp . i built another one ... that fell over and then sank into the swamp ... . so i built another ... and that stayed up . ... and that 's what your gon na get , lad : the most powerful kingdom in this island .
you 'd better stay here . i 'll find a way out . we 'll come back for you .
naah , wilder knows we got friends in town .
a woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it . then she takes a trip and leaves it behind . why ?

it makes me so mad . steven schwimmer ready to strike . the exterminating angel .
did you see that ? it 's remarkable !
ok. roger .
where we going -- ?
straight to the pole - at almost fifty knots !
that 's okay , kelly . you 're doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
terrific . i 'll talk to you then .
i tell you , if we do n't stick together on this , you could find yourself first president 's opposition . du royaum uni .
your train ? listen , friend , you 're obviously lost . ... i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .
but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they 'll be looking for me !
i do n't like those studs they 've sent . i want you to have pearls . nice big pearls .
i mean i ca n't tell you .
but are n't you the grandson of the famous dr. victor frankenstein ? ... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ?
interest ? ! there 's six of the top actresses that want this thing .
so , school going alright ?

and he says , 'yah , that guy 's dead and i do n't mean a old age . ' and then he says , 'geez , i 'm goin ' crazy out there at the lake . '
... huh ?

where 's mom ?
yeah . like in against all flags . only they use a couple big hams .
it 's in the main ballroom .

why , you do n't have to apologize , mr. warne . you 'll never know how much i appreciate all this .
there is somebody ...
you 're in violation .

good morning gentleman .
i understand that you have political ambitions . unfortunately , you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
if it 's too far , then we 'll drown . but if we don抰 try then we 'll never know .
you know that thing it says in here about rashes ?
do i look like i need your money . it doesn抰 work like that and i can抰 tell you why .

you know , kyle , you 're still pretty hot for a pre-bicentennial babe ...
love him ... yes , it is true . that 's the hard part for me ... i knew him better than anyone ... i knew him best .
of course it matters ! it throws off everything ! `` superhero '' is manhood 's highest achievement . manhood ! your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core . you were my buddy , my comrade -- women are n't buddies , women are n't warriors ! you tried to turn the cult of good into some after-work softball team ! it 's time to get thrown from the treehouse ...
i do n't know what you did , but that kid stopped . i have n't heard one peep , not one 'breaker breaker ' for days . believe me , it 's a pleasure ... .

i was listening --
i sincerely hope so .

i will seek the fortress for you .
well , i hope you like these ! fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed . or `` nori '' if you prefer . i love sushi .
she was murdered ?
good luck .
i did n't know your family knew johnny fontane .
he appreciates your concern , michael , and your respect .
it will be .
i do n't want you getting anyone in my place .
couldn抰 make it . splitting headache .
what was that ?
... men every time i 've closed my eyes ? but after you went away , i --
that 's good then . you 've found something .
sure witt ! now art thou sociable , now art thou romeo ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature .
let 's try to be precise then . the word `` torture '' does not appear in our orders . we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies . as for the nlf , they request that their members , in the event of capture , should maintain silence for twenty-four hours , and then , they may talk . thus , the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... what type of interrogation should we choose ? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months ?
it may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source .
six to five and pick'em ... you wan na < u > chance < /u > it ...
popeye .
but buljanoff , iranoff , kopalski ...
you mean like we do n't give a shit .
i 'm afraid that will have to wait , mrs. lampert .
oh , i was scared of the same thing , heather . the minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you 're stepping into quicksand . quicksand filled with bad complexions , bad grades , bad parents , bad drugs , and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up .
my flesh and blood !
he ca n't walk , walter !
goodbye , officer .
can he trust you ?
you 're really doing a great job here , josie . i like your `` can do '' attitude .
general schmuck , are you positive of your figures ?
... you do n't have to think .
it 's ethics . i put evil men behind bars , but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these ... cocksuckers to slip through . i 've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist . as if they have god 's permission . but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them ... technically .
the shiny stuff . the ice . the big , big , big money is available 's what will the english says .
stay as long as you like , son . no rush .
no idea .
yeah ... fine .
joe what abilities ... ?
may i see your violin ?
how did this business get started , anyhow ? why are the birds nesting here ?
a prize ? for what ?
i do n't have a memory and i 'm not a princess ! even if i were - no one 's ever going to believe it . i 'm not exactly ...
no . just a few hours .
i know . i 'm kidding you . chill out .
you ai n't coming to work ?
in 76 years , me neither .
i think that 'll hold it . hello shirley . just helping someone tie up a christmas present . how are you ?
tank .
yes .
joe , you do n't know how glad i am you 're aboard . anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man , i 'm in his corner .
any other family ?
i always wondered what the world would be like . but now that i 've seen it , i do n't need to see any more . it 's all right . once i 'm in the tank , i wo n't remember any of this .
they wo n't listen .
okay . three-twenty sycamore ? . . .
you were n't disappointed in her , then .
well sir , i was an ironmaster before you got me . maybe i will let you down yet .
who 's with me ?
you 're both embezzling . i saw the records .
hey , at least it 's not goofy .
not i ? i am alive , yet every hope i had is dead , death can be good . death can be happy.. if i were really dying i could speak like cyrano - ? `` my courage like a white plume '' ? and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death . then perhaps you might understand ,
a `` pond , '' or
ackland ? i do n't know him well enough to say . if we were back on earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure . there 's not much we can do out here .
yes . say hello to col --
yeah , we 've been through that .
a rough estimate .
fireworks . update -- we 're con- structing the number '65 ' on the barge , archers from the state college at new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it , when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a viking funeral with none of the morbidity ... the hudson river authority says , for you , they 'll make a special dispensation - of course there 'll be an overtime bill for the poughkeepsie fire dept ...
sid ! ! !
hmmm .
thanks . but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year . and then i thought `` gee . that seems awfully silly . that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment , do n't you think ? ''
of course , i 've had to make some additions for the new models , but not as many as you might think . once you have your basic set it 's then only a question of variation .
now , mister ambassador . in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone . i intend to tell him exactly what has happened . i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him .
hi .
well that 's just , that 's the stress talking , dude . so far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes --
i 'm coming , what 's the rush ? ! ohh ! what 's that ? ! there 's stuff all over the floor ! i ca n't see a thing !
they will kill you . and then they will kill your wife , too .
not at all .
what were you , following me ?
he 's takin ' cheap shots .
now i remember . annette harrison . your father 's the new headmaster at oakwood .
flash , get lost .
see , i know you want it to stay `` pleasant '' but there are so many things that are so much better : like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ... and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them . look at those faces back there . they 're no different than you are . they just happened to see something inside themselves that you do n't want to ...
you 're a ... you 're sick .
what 's that ?
i was just curious -- you do n't do it well , so i wondered . have you been threatened , if you told the truth , is that it ?
holy shit , ronnie ! you 're a fuckin ' rock star .
i do n't know what 's going on .
john bigboot ? +++ $ +++ john whorfin will kill us !
you look like an orange worm .
this kisser was n't so bad you could n't lay under it a few times .
you said bad things hurt places . so maybe good things heal them . good things are happening here . maybe for the first time ever . and maybe that 's all it takes .
it 's a long song - szerelem means love卆nd the story - there 's a hungarian count , he 's a wanderer , a fool . for years he 's on some kind of quest , who knows what ? and then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious english woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave . he sews her clothes , he worships the hem of -
they had to , in order to survive .
what are you talking about ?
this girl -- thea ? is not a servant in my household , sir . she is my daughter 's companion . now , sir , if you 'll excuse me , i 'll go have a look at mr. jacks .
i 'm gon na leave you two creative geniuses alone .
what is it you need me to do ?
yeah . true . the cops were n't much help either . their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something . make sense to you ?
because i do n't want to see him hurt .
throw me his ball .
on the left .
what 's all the panic about ?
a goodly length in times past , but lately
man , is this interesting .
look , nick . what 's wrong ?
they do n't give two fucks about your health . the clinic 's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment . look at o'neill --
allie , i know exactly why you 're doing this .
forget it . i 'm sick of working for that dickhead .
no ! i do n't know what janet 's next move will be ... but you can be sure of one thing ... it all starts here !
stinks . i could never figure -- i could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck ' on their airplanes .
i show , you give me the information ?
uh-uh . do n't tell us , jam . just show us .
it 's my life . if i want to fuck it up , that 's my business .
one-seven-four-nine-five natoma .
`` but you wo n't ... ''
of course not . i 'm robin hood . i take from the rich , and give to the needy ...
yes ?
i had that fire . he did n't listen !
in his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something . covered with blood .
you guys been holding hands ?
but then ... but then ...
i 'm gon na be on tv ! just like diane sawyer .
i 'm sorry , sir , i have no intention of making light of this committee . and i have no intention of incurring your wrath , mr. chairman . i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath . they 've sent me letters from jail .
it 's been here seventeen years . did you live here before or something ?
oh ?
just watch .
she 's so nice .
you have a strong unfufilled desire .
i did n't care for 'sister ' last night , and i do n't like 'lovey ' this morning . my name is lovett - alexander , p .
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs .
she wants a picture .
commander , what are you doing here ?
sabu ... high white dude 's the only thing you could hustle .
would you care for some water , conner ?
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody . what do you think , bateman ?
you 're blowing your only chance . act like i 'm gino .
you saw a forgery .
you 've been having strange sex ... !
yes .
bah ! all you wanted to do was spy in our country !
are you drunk ?
fine - keep on yelling - do everything you can to disturb firefly - now what about your cousin ?
which side do you like ?
-- when you go away .
hi , chief . you like the suicide ?
that 's alright . we 'll take it from here .
before .
i do n't have it . i do n't know where it is .
just a moment , dear . we ca n't have it , rose . can you behave yourself -- or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question . if you ca n't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?
but i will have it on my birthday , wo n't i ?
party at john k's-senior year . i get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom . caitlin comes in and dives all over me .
it 's that time of year again . we should get a pretty good show out here .
where 's the back door ?
you want to see pain ? swing by first methodist tuesday nights . see the guys with testicular cancer . that 's pain .
... yes sir . your quarters sir .

i 'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others . all of them ...
satisfied , wiseass ?
come on , you can make it .
i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings . through the roof . but in this game you got ta be one , two , three steps ahead . i introduce you to myrna goldfarb . she 's the best media consultant in the biz .
and , nothing . they checked out just fine .
victoria .
put your shoulders back .
i thought he was dead .
not now . you got my bag ?
mom and dad . i used to be in my crib and i 'd listen to them fight .
that 's what we 're here to find out .
nevertheless , i 'd like to see you in my office monday morning .
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...
what did you get me ?
what 's that ? what are you up to ? nickie - what is this ?
okay . you read me well enough . why ca n't i read you ?
i 'd like an ice-cold heineken .
you want to make me look like him ...
i am not . and i do n't got ta .
all set .
what are you doing here , where 've you been ?
we could reach it on fire-mares .
you planned this whole thing , did n't you ?
keeping an eye on things . checking the place out .
step lively now !
no , not just that .
julie , you said you were tired . waybe you were dreaming .
a bit fucking late .
no , i am . i am .
you were late .
why the hell are n't you in school ?

no , i do n't think so . that 's someone else .
then was it worth it ?
and monster ... he was talking with the casino manager . nick was talking to him .

lucy ! be serious . we could be executed for treason !
ruben 's dead . so stupid , a cop thing , a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes ... i 'm sorry ... because you and he ...
no baby . we 'll all be right in .
if you could be count chocula , frankenberry or trix the rabbit , who 'd you be ?
what are you talking about ?
like , look at her . she looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down . elvis would n't fuck her with pat boone 's dick .
johnny , what the fuck ?
an extra heel of bread . please take it , you need your strength . you 've been working so hard .
here 's how they 're organized . groups of five , very different personalities : scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for . and they all score high on the insomnia charts .
here , now , you 're broke , are n't you ?
yeah . she 's so little , so pretty , and innocent .
why johnny ringo , you look like somebody just walked over your grave . oh , i was n't quite as sick as i made out .
they did n't find any signs of life on the viking missions .
ya just got paid , so leave me the fuck alone .
we 're not hanging out . i 'm being escorted back to work .
let me have them , and i might consider it .
you want death ? is it death you want ?
open my eyes -- please , open my eyes !
killaine 's not that sort of guy . he said no -- he meant no .
that there frank burns is a menace . whenever a patient croaks on him it 's either god 's will or somebody else 's fault .
ha . ha .
nice to meet you ?
see you soon .
that 's right .
i have to go . he sighs .
well , ben , it was quite a bit to do with me .
it 's not a discharge . right , edmunds ? you said before , right ? so it 's got ta be a message .
yeah
you remember how i was , louis.. the vampire lestat ...
yes . that follows .
he is n't .
what did you get us ?
no . there 's no behavior modification .
you like it ?
you have it .
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
why did he come to you ?
`` changes . '' and it 's not just the fire or big stuff like that . it 's little things . did you hear about bill miller ?
are you okay ?
like you helped her , jake ?
if he were telling truth he would n't have told us .
i do n't know , michael . this is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'd ' .
my perfume ?
if i had known i was going to have company , he was right next to me . i think he heard me peeing ! i hate that , i am glad he 's in jail .
and his ears .
yes . now was there anything else you wanted to discuss , mister mcmurphy ?
look , i know you 're upset . i 'm really sorry , honey . i raced home as quick --
they did n't say an address ?
ok. ssh . rest .
i think i 'll keep that to myself . which way are the rooms ?
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
keep driving . do n't slow down .
suffering . you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread .
where 're you going ?
poppy , please , just tell me what you want .
now , aim --
okay , you just got ta calm yourself down , that 's all , just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you 'll be fine .
oh no . do you ?
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message ...
i 'm sorry to hear about that , sir . his face contorted in rage .
could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you 're getting ready for a date .
when he said it , fifty years ago , he might have been right . but today , war is too important to be left to the politicians . do you follow me , major ?
yeah -- well , i 'm sorry i 'm tying up jane , i did n't realize you two would be going this late . sorry .
you 're wasting your fucking time , man , you 're wasting my time . you do n't know how to do this , and the longer we stay in here , the more likely she 's gon na lose it and call the cops !
but roeder 's dead . ballistics says it 's shu ! we do n't have one witness -- unless we put cecil stipe on the stand ...
i played richard iii ...
it 's payday , need me to pick up your check ?
... okay ...
stay up there , girl ...
because i 'm worried that you 're putting your faith in this guy who , because of the way things are going , may not have an emotional marble in his head .
the building and what ?
let 's hope she does n't expect me to swim upstream .
who ?
oh god .
ghostbusters .
sorry . my pajamas are tailored . would it be too distressing to continue with the towel ? no more immodest than a kilt , you know .
if i told you , you would n't believe me .
why , that 's an echo , sir !
well , no you did n't --
a naked guy with a gun ? you expect anyone to believe that ?
hey , neither did et ; but that was a great movie , right ?
fifty cars . fifty cars by 8 am friday . or kip goes in that box . that was the deal ... goddamn , it ... that was the deal ...
i think it was a little more complicated than --
who ?
you believe in it .
hey taylor , you okay man ?
okay , how tall did you < i > used < /i > to be ?
we have n't implanted it yet .
but wynant -- - ?
why did n't you tell me ?
i do n't know what these things are ... all i know is ...
and whether you want to believe it or not , you already fired the first shot . on another matter , federal corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks -- scars , tattoos . i did a search and came up with this .
jesus , sanchez ... what do you think you 're doin ' ? that 's flatfoot data . you 're not supposed to have access to that .
that 's a great idea .
what about it ?
how much is your salary ?
smoking ? i 'm not smoking .
yeah .
thank you , eve - i like this house very much .
you know what i mean when i say `` it . ''
talk ... we should send down an assault team and take them by force .
we can go to one if you 'd prefer .
i said i 'll think about it .
do n't ever stare him down .
um , he stopped by yesterday before you came over .
guys , i know it has n't been easy ... the divorce and now the move ... but i think you 're really going to like living in santa carla ...
of course we have no money as you know it . we do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because , well , because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it .
this ai n't george 's doing -- !
she works hard .
i know . it does n't make any sense . that 's why i trust it .
i 'm staying with the countess .
i want to buy you a drink .
i guess you realize that there 's something special that i want to talk to you about .
and if it is ?
it 's a beautiful home you have here mrs. rosemond .
he will be ... when he ca n't write , he drinks .
you , arlo .
i just came to say good night . i do n't want you to see me -- i 'm not very attractive .
have we reached the epi-center ?
no , but it was here .
tell me .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .
everything you say sounds reason- able . but there 's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite .
oh thank buddha it 's you , kim-lo , i 'm being held against my will , my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call ...
those people down there are shi'ites . you 've got shi'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north . neither of them 've got much love for saddam . probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising , so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some .
you oughta say you 're sorry -- that 's what you oughta do .
oh indeed . cotton ' .
jesus .
i 'm sorry .
if she were a true blonde , she would 've left the cheating bastard . blondes do n't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it .
yes ?
'cause i look like i just got outta jail , that 's why . you droppin ' me off at home , right ? there 's a place by me .
well , i am in the construction business , buddy , and without braggin ' i have done real good at it . there are those who would n't have expected that out of me . right now i 'm buildin ' a giant motel unit near alexandria , outside washington , d.c. not fi-nance , i 'm on the construction side .
excuse me , vendela , have you seen diane ? we 're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight .
no , it was so right it scares me .
it is what i want . but i do n't want to spend the next ten years in jail . i do n't want you guys to go to jail . we do n't know what could be waiting for us up there . it 'll probably be just what it 's supposed to be . the only thing that 's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars . i 'm just looking at the downside .
she was n't so bad .
the name may not mean anything to you , young lady , but say the word and i 'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours .
lieutenant pierson , phoenix police . i have a car here .
the fear of death , the pain of consciousness . did you mix this martini ?
who was that on the phone ?
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds ?
that sounds like dignan .
yes , i 'm doctor venkman .
what 's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates ?
they got to you first , but they 've underestimated how important you are . if they knew what i know , you would probably be dead .
now you 're being rude , shorty .
i 'm talking to you gently now .
i am going to call the police now .
shucks , i dunno . but maybe there 's a reason why you 've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities , dammit !
i hoped there might be -- but no , i 'm assured there are n't .
of course . drown them like puppies .
take me away ...
let 's go .
good . very good . welcome , my friend . welcome to my country .
we live in 703 .
please .
i 'd be too scared to ask him for it .
blame the nigger , then , huh ? someone turns up dead , you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
can we get a t.v . ?
... i 'm sorry , i 'm a little discon- certed , that stuff between you and susan -- uh -- threw me .
just picture some french number been spending all day , every day , making cream-colored , shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists , what the hell you think she wears at night ?
begging your pardon lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody 'd see them - i got five live bodies left ...
without your pants .
do n't worry . nobody 's going to disturb you .
what you mean ? tommy ai n't done nothin ' .
it 's like a cab is n't it ?
so you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence ?
you 're not the only one ...
the food does n't please you ?
power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate . if i can hit him . i can kill him . but i got ta be close . very close .
why would you help me ?
the room key 's in the car . on the seat .
just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat , goody-good friend betty finn doing a crest commercial . no one would buy crest .
thanks for your help , peck .
dude , i 'm sorry --
it must be just so pathetic being you . sure billy , grab your dog we 'll eat in the van .
what 's that like ?
i hate that . i wo n't stand for it .
miss hall and ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously . she walked away and he 's wanting her back ever since . we believe she 's our surest and quickest way of location him .
it 's a 27b/6 of course .
uh ... uh ... umm ... long time .

i wish i did n't love you so much .

yes . i have seen styles on television .

xxxxxx
he said that the shit could get hot , could get heavy ... i said good . 'cuz i got two of the hottest , heaviest bitches alive .

at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool .

nah . once i get my own wheels , i could come up all the time .

my world famous , famous world arroz con pollo will be ready very soon .

frank asked if she 'd sit in for a song , she said yes , and we did a few bars .
hundreds of people . believe me , i did n't imagine this .
stop calling it the property , you sound ridiculous .
you 're kind of cultivating a new look .
what ? what ?
good , let 's drink up .
correct .
my end ?
where did you disappear to ?
so was i. the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not .
i was , later .
you do n't like flashbacks because your mother 's a historian .
how do you know about me ?
one thing is certain ; we can not escape on auxiliary power .
but if we have not caught wallace --
no , no . this will not do . anger is what you feel .
let 's drop back an ' boot up .
it 's like a small figure , hoverin ' over me . gettin ' closer .
i am beautiful , are n't i ?
so . what 's next ?
what am i supposed to do , seth ? he recognized us .
< u > what < /u > ?
i think maybe you 'd better deliver him . let me give you my address .
i 'm askin ' ya to go to him -- as a favor .
danny , listen , people expect me to daven ; they do n't want someone they do n't know -- leading their prayers .
nothin ' ! aside from max 's mother driving me crazy , i 'm dancin ' on a rainbow ! get him on the line , please .
`` don ? ''
just wait there for me !
that 's different .
i 'd rather stand if it 's all the same to you .
oh , that 's too bad . do n't you think the wizard could help him , too ?
i 'm sorry , i only ...
you better get down here .
that 's good . that 's uh ... good .

now then , were you in police custody this morning ?
hide out for what ? we ai n't doin ' nothin ' .
thanks for everything .
bitch , bitch , bitch . you want something to drink ?
i think it 's a marvelous letter .
oh , there 's something wrong with you , all right . especially after hearing that dream of yours , about the roto-rooter .
who knows . who cares ... you wanted slime . you got slime .
we suspect him of freelance subversion .

i never saw anything like it . how did she pick him up so fast ?
... you do n't have to come in ...
where is madame trillaud ?
is that right ? ca n't say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit . i know i 've had my fill of this town . sixteen years i 've been the law and order here . so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place . help people , i guess . keep the peace . problem is there 's so much peace around here they do n't much need me . got a lot of speeders , but they 're speeding through miles of nothing so i ca n't hardly blame them . other than that , well , there ai n't much to steal . i reckon that the last big crime we had was , what would you say mrs. mckenna ? a murder ?
he 'll think something 's wrong i ai n't there .
it 's our money . he had no right to take it .
taking my boyfriend to the airport .

what ?
hell of a way to die .
it 's this bullshit . it 's just bullshit right here . this is the fuckin ' problem , you know .
personal protection . it 's a dangerous world we live in , jimmy , a very dangerous world .

can you ? you damn well better be . jesus , if i had n't been honest in my business dealings ? well , of course , you ca n't always be honest , not with the sharks swimming around this town ? but if you 're a writer , you do n't think about those things ? if i 'd been totally honest , i would n't be within a mile of this pool ? unless i was cleaning it . but that 's no reason for you not to be . honest , i mean . not cleaning the pool .
perceval , you have returned !

you get my slapped with a fine , you fight with the customers and i have to patch everything up . you get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse . to top it all off , you ruin my relationship . what 's your encore ? do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank ? you know what the real tragedy is ? i 'm not even supposed to be here today !
dr. chilton ... i believe you know each other ?
yes , sir !
pretty clever : if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time , sam 's is the first place they 'll look . they may figure you 're waiting for an airplane , so you ca n't stay in the shack by the airstrip . last place they 'd expect you is on the far side of town . i ca n't afford any trouble --

why did n't you say so . go right out and get her . ed . build the fire up .
i ca n't hold on much longer !
you 've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with , correct ?
you never did like me much , did you verne ? and you ca n't stand it that i walked out of there alive and liz did n't . you think i 'm a coward , do n't you ?
sam ! hi !
oh god , tommi ...
so you 're in ?
yeah ... you said that last night .
what ?
jesus christ , what an evening . what happened ?
she knows now .
why the hell did n't you tell us this was at stake !
a tooth they say could n't have come from any bear . they say it looks prehistoric . like maybe a dinosaur .
well that 's what i 'm trying to figure out . how long have you known him ?
where 's my mother ?
you 're also a fool .
i 'm here , sir , i just - i do n't know how to feel about it .
so you decided to help him after all ?
we 're fucked .
it was for twenty-five thousand dollars .
i hear you 're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything . i 'm glad you 've stayed clean .
no , it 's not ok ! we 're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make !
fine . i 'm takin ' amy .
-- so yesterday afternoon i take sylvia up to the apartment , and guess who he 's got stashed away in the bedroom ?
would yous boys excuse us a second ? loretta , you too .
why not ?
what about one guy with two guns ?
say it not lightly ... do you know its meaning ?
okay . okay .
ca n't you remember your own name ?
i know who you are and what you want .
look , i just better go .
oh shit . i 'm sorry . i 'm a total fucking maniac . delete all that , okay ? i spoke for myself , this need n't rub off on my wife . oh shit . i get pissy sometimes . much worse than otis . otis does n't bite . it 's just , i really love my dog and he does n't really bark a lot . we live in a canyon . we hear dogs barking at night , too . and it 's not otis .
i think maybe , we 're both so used to operating at this level that -- how can one person be unhappy ? if one person is unhappy , both have to be ... by definition .
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this i 'll help it presently !
hello , charlie . long time no see .
sleep well .
anything else ?
and people make their choice --
blessings on thee , the both ... well ... got ta run now . see you two kids later !
sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute . the evidence of every scam we ever pulled . the evidence that 's going to put us away for twenty years .
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?
mickey ? call the state homicide bureau . do n't touch anything , just sit back and wait .
yeah ...
there 's a strip mall not half a mile from my house . there 's phones there . i cruised the place , but i did n't see her . i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and did n't want to be found . i do n't know ... maybe i should have called . but it 's not like kelly ca n't take care of herself . i figured we 'd just take it up on monday , in the office .
you did n't miss much . christ , what a mess .
cuz he got the girl , now he 's leaving town .
and who is that ?
yes . in that order .
where 'd you go ?
professor , be serious , would you ?
oh , what is this ? some kind of staring contest between two kids from the `` old neighborhood ? ''
that 's a pretty brassiere .
that was a joke ? you do n't tell jokes .
yeah , you look quizzical yet pensive .
why would you do that ?
i know you did .
you see , it s like i say . you always have an answer for everything .
goddamn sam !
they 're not on to us . i 'm gon na call boyd .
no , what is it ?
how do i know you wo n't kill my daughter once i 'm gone ?
right . and you-and you know what the beauty part is ?
go get it .
what 's that ?
gin 's okay .
i do n't care . i 'm not staying out late doug .
again , i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders. ! what about you ?
a what ?
but how can he ? he 'll kill you .
`` the killer was n't chinese '' ... cecil stipe was right . . !
business first . i went into the `` warrants '' system and erased your records . you 're clean . in fact , you 're now on the informant payroll .
name 's patrick , i met him at the driving range .
we do n't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them ?
hullo .
you 're not holding him right ... caz ...
yes .
it 's no use . she just is n't here .
ah ! and what sort of man is this worshiper ?
khan , listen to me -- if its me you want , i 'll have myself beamed aboard . all i ask is that you spare my crew .
what are you crying for ?
what 's that ?
a literary feud . quite normal .
we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiner 's background . so far , they have n't come up with a thing - what 's more , as a result of their eagerness , one of their ablest agents blew his cover , we have him in custody at this time .
dinner ... tonight .
hey , boy - i 'm talkin ' to you .
shut up ! drop it .
we are farmers here , not lawyers or bankers , or even constables . every penny we earn comes from what we send down the hudson .
resting ?
do you remember what we talked about ?
but if you want facts , indy , i have none to give you . at my age , i 'm prepared to take a few things on faith .
i underestimated him ... he did the one thing i did n't anticipate ... he destroyed himself ...
i can only stay for one drink , ben . i 've got to meet with victor .
winners do n't do coke . or have n't you been reading the bumper stickers ?
i do n't know .
in the generator room again ?
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister , soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our `` androgenous '' planet .
i know this sounds crazy . i understand . check your parents ' blood types . are you sure your parents are your birth parents ?
nobody 's gon na catch him sleeping . do n't worry about him .
we want the man who did this --
you like sad stories -- you want mine .
push her , c'mon .
no . he will master the leader .
is that him ? is that him ?
i was never politically correct enough for comrade dowd .
not again ...
follow that budjovice sign .
yeah , right . tell that to crockett .
how did you find out ?
how 's the new job ?
how long you had this ?
what - no lust for adventure ?
do it !
really ?
i 'm sorry kayleigh . this was a bad idea .
and what may i ask brought this on ?
well -- i have n't needed much law so far -- what i 'd like to get first is a little common sense --
whoever . the point is , prices are goin ' up , too . better get your little black book out , richard . we got some business to talk about .
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye ? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky ? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting ? when will the heart be aweary of beating , and nature die ?
i did n't mean to --
i do n't know why joe , we 've known each other how long ...
we both lied to him .
you 're your own baby .
free press ? press is free ... for anyone who owns one . larry tisch has a free press .
i 'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences .
what did you think ?
why you nitwit . you almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career !
it 's gon na be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why 's that ?
she gave me the evil eye .
yeah . right .
utah ?
so dump on me .
... you know , if you want to be the same old bastard , that 's fine . i can handle it . but do n't pull this 'man of the people ' bullshit and then do something like this .
i did n't have the heart .
i said , sir -- in my official capacity -- as an honorary gesture -- i appoint you to the united states senate !
yes .
we should just do it .
i know it 's late . i -- are you there ?
that 's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden .
oh , hunt , please ! one ca n't hold nyah responsible for her actions..
well , that just happens to be exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm eh ... i 'm outlining a new writing project , and eh ...
and what am i ? a shriner ? no , if you 'll join forces with me , together we can make the world safe for war profits again .
very well . that means that you have met all mr. holland 's requirements . now , as to salary -- it 's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month .
he 's comin ' over .
only he was n't dead . he killed barry and helen last july fourth .
that 's some pinfall . almost a 133 average . her ball 's flat , she needs to work on her spin control .
and the last one ?
my name 's not kid . it 's client . as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle . now , you got something for me or not ?
yes ?
joke ! joke ! aspirin ! it does n't matter what brand .
wise guy , huh ? trying to louse me up -
it will and you know why ? because you 're not a person anymore , you 're a cadet in the united states army ; you have no identity , no miranda warning , and no rights . so i 'm gon na throw you to the wolves , and unlike you , i 'm gon na get away with it , because you 're pissing me off !
right . and then communication satellites , and then anywhere .
yes ! i was paid ! but the ?
did kendall tell you about the px ?
i 'm holding your hand !
and you never will . but i 've got a job to do , too . where i 'm going you ca n't follow . what i 've got to do you ca n't be any part of . ilsa , i 'm no good at being noble , but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . someday you 'll understand that . now , now ...
c'mon help me in . i 'll open the front door .
then why do n't you leave ? just give me one good reason .
who 's ever going to want me ? nobody will .
where the hell were you ?
oh , you remember my name do you ? you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body ?
yes .
oh that . that was an exercise to prove a point . about the evils of conformity .
you 're having the best time of your life , are n't you ?
we call them zippers . they 're not supposed to be a challenge .
dr. chilton - if lecter feels you 're his enemy - as you 've said - then maybe i 'll have more luck by myself . what do you think ?
dead .
well , we got $ 40 , and we wan na buy ...
oh , yes , well , you know , when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first . it 's not like it 's been marked down or anything .
what now ?
she 's fine . please --
excuse me ?
okay , vee proceed . but only if there is no funny stuff .
i dunno . i guess i 'm just stupid .
if we do n't go now , it wo n't happen .
i do n't know ... i mean , he 's around , he 's here , in town , y'know , but i do n't know ... he 's a tough one ... very ... . do you have a girlfriend , phil ?
maybe we oughta call you no-ears . you do n't listen much , do you , boy ?
killing himself .
they g-got the wrong g-guy .
nothing , really . she 's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
he has israel .
what 's the matter ?
that 's a long story ...
there was nothing to it . it was my pleasure .
how 'd he die ?
what you promised - do it ! do n't finagle around . it 's later than you think .
i have n't climbed in months -- you lose the feel .
nix was never interested in you . it was always swann .
i 'm scared .
no .
joe -
look at that .
i do n't know . maybe we built the damn thing wrong . maybe it was all a hoax ... the safest thing would probably be to do a chernobyl ; encase it in concrete .
here is seattle . and here is baltimore . case closed .
so . you 're a soldier . fighting for whom ?
what about your mother ?
are we going away , daddy ?
well , whatta you mean ? i mean , it 's perfectly fine out here . i mean , tony 's very nice and , uh , well , i meet people and i go to parties and- and we play tennis . i mean , that 's ... that 's a very big step for me , you know ? i mean ... i 'm able to enjoy people more .
i told you to remain on the command ship .
close that door . do n't let anybody in or out .
what do you mean ?
the hors d'oeuvres are here . is there anything else i can do ?
i do n't mean that . how would he act ? what would he do ?
thanks , but i 've got plans .
no , no bible readers .
oh , teddy . we missed you so much .
i imagine , right now , you must be feeling a bit like alice , tumbling down the rabbit hole ?
would n't it be quicker if we all helped ?
you 're still a little ... disoriented .
stop nagging .
next time when i feel a little better perhaps .
then why did n't you help the kid when you were there ?
it 'll bring us together again , hildy -- just the way we used to be .
can i trust you , sami ?

then ordering fresh horses , the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital . i need not tell you that i was the chevalier .
wait , i 've made up my mind . i want a plain omelette , forget the tomatoes , do n't put potatoes on the plate , and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee .
not have it .
we lived in temple texas for many years . raised a family there . in temple . we come out here about four years ago .
it 's more fun hearin ' stories in the dark .
listen , i got ta problem . this girl ai n't feelin ' well , y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise , y'know once in awhile an ' ice skatin ' is the best thing --
am i supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out ?
i do n't know what to say .
you 're getting out of hand . i do n't know what 's come over you today .
i do n't ... i do n't want to answer that ... look we 're friends .
is he inside ?
looks like a damn graveyard round here .
she , too , is a great admirer of yours .
oh ... well alright , you can be red if you want .
this kind of heat . it 's pathetic .
if you do decide to come , do n't say i told you about it . it 's supposed to be a surprise party .
wampum ?
they must 've scuttled it . nobody just lets a ship float away .
m'lady ... if anyone sees , it is death ...
do you think i could borrow your limousine ? i 'll get it back to you in an hour .
you know , royce , i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets , too .
no scars .
so , the doctor , he has to make the -- -- come se dice ?
well ... she 's an extremely jealous person . i did n't want her to find out about the girl .
because i guarantee she 's married and has a couple kids . girls like mary do n't stay single .
dad ! get us outta here !
life is pain , highness . anyone who says differently is selling something . i remember this farm boy of yours , i think . this would be , what , five years ago ?
... to look me in the eye and say what 's important to you is n't as important to me ? to tell me you know what 's best ? to tell me life is more precious than what i feel for my wife ?
well , you 've been getting a pretty low salary here in new york . it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what he 's worth .
then i guess you 're stuck . life sentence . no parole .
that 's a risk i 'm willing to take . deep down , you 're good . even jade fox could n't corrupt you .
before making any decisions , i think i should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange , unreasoning attitudes .
are you sure you would n't like to see a canary instead ? we have some very nice canaries this week .
aye --
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials .
i 'll take you down there .
are you all right ?
washed away .
what did she say ?
do i really want to know what you 're talking about ?
that 's your offer ? you , sailing away nice and pretty with the black pearl , and all i have is a name ?
number six .
well , now , that 's very kind -- thanks . that 's what i want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- yes , that 's what i want . i can pay now if you like .
but ...
the man has taken over my mind . he 's not only out there . he 's in my head and i ca n't get rid of him . i ca n't write a word without imagining his response . i 'm paralyzed as an artist .
he does n't need a friend , he needs a shrink .
it happens .
okay ... would you rather ... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month , or make love to a otter on crank for a week ?
i think you oughta cut a ...
yeah . turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace .
who are you ?
simple logic will suffice . we need a map . that one should do .
look , i appreciate being able to talk this out , but , uh ...
i must be honest with you . i first approached three generals more senior than yourself , and they all very prudently sent excuses .
nothing .
yeah ! sure .
why would you want to go home ? it 's so early .
do you like talk like that ?
it 's not loaded .
i will make that recommendation to the president . i must tell you in all honesty that i 'm extremely dubious about the results .
claudia , listen to me ...
you wo n't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality , will you , girl ?
to kill your wife .
for what ?
say you 're feeling faint - the sun .
a salesman -- that 's what i am . i mean , i 'm gon na be anyway . i 'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as i get enough seed money .
christ no !
honey , what is it ?
you will . time is on our side . sooner or later , the thirst always wins .
now who 'd go and do ...
all right . i 'll be in my workshop for a little while . i 'll be in in a little while . i need to unwind a little . i 'll be in soon . a little while .
why not mine the damned walls ?
i woke up this morning at three and could n't fall back asleep . everyday i think i see more of sam than i 've seen in years .
you 're as bad as the rest of them , elaine ! it 's all here in the design specifications ! look ! it 's all here !
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had .
i dunno , probably right up there , based on her resume .
you 're so full of shit .
i 'll be seeing you .
oh , no . she 'll be crazy about it . well , see you later . i 'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space . goodbye .
there 's an evil streak in everybody , rose .
how do you not tread on the earth ? i mean , you kind of have to .
... me , too .
yes he is - he wants to talk to you .
i could n't tell you .
let me just clarify a few things . i do n't care what kind of cop you are in china , you have no jurisdiction in america . without me you are just another tourist .
oh yeah ...
not from me . i only stole it . when are you coming over to the chamberlain 's men ?
maybe we will . nice meeting you .
shit , maybe he 'll kill you .
we 're american soldiers . we do n't abandon people .
how so ?
yeah , but i 'm okay . i 've got some work to do .
yes , norma .
wish me luck !
screening calls . any suggestions ?
... well , then , i guess we do n't have to worry about him anymore .
no . thank you . i 'm in ... a hurry . i just want to make a change and start ...
my job , bruce . i started it -- and i 'll finish it .
i wish you 'd give it a try .
boy ! my head 's like a balloon -- for two whole days . i never knew there was so much american history .
< u > no < /u > .
he talks loud . and he loves his code .
why ?
get the fu- you threatening me ? i 'll fuckin ' kill you in this place ! get up and go home right now .
look , i ca n't run your arrest in cnn , but i guarantee he 's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world , for what they might be saying about him , if nothing else - he 's got the ability and , we assume , the desire to get you out of there .
it was n't long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia . they needed him in prague , but there the gestapo were waiting for him . just a two-line item in the paper : `` victor laszlo apprehended . sent to concentration camp . '' i was frantic . for months i tried to get word . then it came . he was dead , shot trying to escape . i was lonely . i had nothing . not even hope . then i met you .
we 'll get you fixed up in no time .
then you did n't give him any passwords of any kind ?
-- well no . it never came up .
how 'd you have the manpower to --
scientific american ? really ?
is mom yelling at you too ?
what 're you doing in here ?
no .
pittsburgh ?
how long have you been setting up ?
good-looking , too . like karen .
wha ? me ?
i 'd a found you , ma .
sure . but sometimes we got to create some numbers . the task force is run by statistics , you know ...
are you sure ? about me , i mean ?
will you quit gabbin ' and do what you 're told .
there was an item in the times . i like the title . 'footsteps on the ceiling ' .
will they really teach me to shoot ?
... what is it barton ? are you okay ?
not quite ...
you ca n't -- ! you must n't -- ! i 've all the demons of hell in my head ; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
they 're very nice . let me get my coat .
i did n't mean to . it 's just the way i am .
i do n't mean nothin ' by it . i just do n't know many regular girls , that 's all .
it 's his money . he 's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune . you do want to hurt thaddeus rains , do n't you jesse ?
that 's perfectly all right . i 'm kind of rushed . do you mind if we walk while we talk ?
uh , uh ! my boss is paying for this trip ... ninety percent business ... and he wants practically notarized receipts . i better sign in and get a receipt .
i 'm no detective . i do n't even know how to begin . all i know is i want to do something about all this .
alfredo died . do you remember him ?
oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute !
what time is it ? oh god ! do you always type your letters ? that should be two ts .
you should see the way he looks at you . all sal wants to do is hide the salami .
and what ? vultures ? hawks ? eagles ?
with grenadine , right ?
vicki ? ... this is batman . i thought i 'd call and see how you 're doing .
you 're not going to notify my father , are you ?
you know , i really was n't expecting all this .
those are pretty hostile words .
when i was a kid ? and he was moving us all over the place ? i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 1.0. i thought gary boyd was the greatest .
i 'm fine ... .
-- before he does -- you 're disappointing them , ben . you 're disappointing them .
sylvia plath .
you were going to venice .
i think -- you 're trying to get me drunk .
what are you doing ? !
a man with a death wish .
who ?
what do you wear in the morning ?
i 've got a gun here , sir . it 's always a good idea to have one around .
yes !
what time did you get to bed last night ?
what 's dr. gillman say ?
he did ?
i want to end the centuries of mistrust . i want to be your ally , not your enemy . as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas .
yeah , that 's what i mean . where the hell does this guy live anyway ?
do you realize , mr. gardiner , that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years ?
excuse me for asking .
since you 're feeling guilty , why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it ?
oh , please !
a four hundred dollar lunch tab !
would you describe your husband as an alcoholic ?
up yonder . see the lights ?
let 's hope so , bones . mr. sulu , set us down in golden gate park .
my lips are sealed .
i 'm at sea , jason .
eve did mention the play , you know . but just in passing - she 's never ask to play a part like `` cora , '' she 'd never have the nerve ...
friend of yours ?
could you do anything about it ?
here , let 's both put in two hundred crowns . that should get nine or ten bottles of wine .
we 're always trying to fuck them ... they know it and they like it and they do n't like it ... that 's just how it is ... look , it 's got nothing to do with you , man . it just happened . felicia 's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she 's getting older ... her daughter hates her , what 's she going to do , go to pta meetings ?
nope .
what if they 're naughty ?
who is this man ?
walter --
say , with them fellows - - it 's no trick to get circulation .
ssh !
hey , all right .
blackheart ?
whatever you like .
hi .
what looks good ?
what if we just fucked with 'em ?
used ?
why 'd you betray me , sugarplum ? !
dammit , boy ! is that all you got to say ? more gobbledegook ? that old man 's layin ' up there dead as hell and it just do n't make any difference to you !
well , that 's very kind of you -- only i 'm not feeling well -- you see , i have this cold -- and i thought i 'd go straight home .
come in , come in , siddown over there . coffee ?
with him ?
we dated for about a month last year .
what ?
the hospital ... ?
your money 's no good here .
it 's the atmosphere . too much pressure , not enough oxygen . might take a few days to --
jim court ... no , this is her father . i 'll take ...
-- it 's not me !
oh , yes .
this is bandit i. over .
those rockefellers !
reasonable ? good , i 'd like to meet a reasonable man . why do n't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner ?
so , what 's new anyway ? how 's verdell ?
negative . the t-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there .
fine by me . we brought you a nice little boat , so you can all get back to shore , safe and sound .
one more . smile . one more .
how is our current financial status ?
i forgot my rubber gloves . let 's do it .
i just ... would like to say a few words ... about merle . i guess merle always wanted something ... i do n't know ... better . that fucking guy , he saved my life . he saved sal 's ... what merle liked , he liked things right ... but then there was n't any place for that ... that he could find .
i must have the breakdown now . where is berthier ?
i told 'em about it . they know i 'm well . that mizz wheatley made me some biscuits .
look closely , eve , it 's time you did . i am addison dewitt . i 'm nobody 's fool . least of all - yours .
look , you asked me to follow your girl around , and i did and i started to like her , and then i realized i just could n't in good conscience do it .
hunh .
beth --
bet your ass i kin see fifty yards an ' i kin shoot this sonofabitch ...
nice try . you had me going for a second , but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that . would he ?
no . she was from ladora heights .
sorry -
no ... but i guess he will soon enough . had a spencer rifle on him an ' he was ...
i told them how you were upset we did n't save the guy ...
yes 枛 charge .
come , come . you do n't really expect me to fall for --
dude in uniform get in your face , you do not shoot your mouth off .
you give me more credit than i deserve . of course , i 'm tempted . who would n't be ? but some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one . i 'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes . obviously , some of us have n't .
i better get home . lisa and i are having some friends over .
jesus ... look , james , you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you , by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made . however , i think it 's best if , for the moment at least ... we abstain .
because i envy your normal life . envy is my sin .
ca n't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ? i 've done my best . i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts . he got a fee - what i could afford . ca n't you think of anyone who might do something for him ?
i 'm sorry about that . i really want us to be closer . i have enough unresolved relationships in my ... life .
are you trained in the ways of the desert ?
my scar is a war-wound .
well , what am i supposed to sleep off ? my life ? you know , i 'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when i wake up , what 'll i be , jeff ? a pilot ? maybe a super bowl quarterback or , no , maybe a fucking rock star . right ? i do n't think so , man .
you do n't know .
yes .
but the power ...

he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlay 's joint .
i 'm sure . everybody here 's looking at everybody else 's ass .
well ... perhaps i have `` deviated '' the tiniest bit .
okay , shorty .
i always thought jails make people hard . not you . you 're just not tough enough to forget about beynon . i chose you , not him .
listen , friend , we did n't mean to land here , and if i could get my fighter out of this puddle i would , but i ca n't . so ...
-- my god .
i抣l be alone .

no i 'm really grounded . when i got in late the other night , my father was waiting up for me .
i did n't say i thought we should have saved him..
i was only joking , really ... ca n't i make a joke ? and now you 've got to tell me why you do n't want to .
i think it 's okay , king . they should go off on impact .

not really . the last time i saw her was at that clinic . that was a long time ago .
you were a beautiful baby . so calm .
so what 's up with you and dela ?
okay . goodnight .
if so -- well , we 'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere . because it goes without saying that we ca n't turn him loose . he 'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency , and they 'll run us down like dogs ...
i guess not .

nice to see you .
look .
not a lot .
... if nothing 's wrong , why are we stopping here ?

yah . well , i just ca n't thank you enough , detective sibert , this cooperation has been outstanding .
with all due respect to merk , he does n't have to read my magazine . but he has no right to stop others . ever hear of the first amendment ?
did he see some < u > danger < /u > from defen ...
what 's that ?
dude , it 's us . let us in .
nah , it 's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing . it did n't hurt at all . it was just a yoga move . i tucked my head in .
... until our wedding night . when our bodies will join .
i no understand you . maybe crazy .
listen to her singing .
do you want a beer or not ?

i 'll jus ' walk on down to the pacific , and from there i 'll ... improvise .
commander , please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having . in `` the quasar dilemma '' , the sentient had taken control of the ship 's guidance systems , however-
down there you buy a life , up here you earn it or die . how 's your health ?
`` ... bio-readings of indeterminate origin , '' do n't you have anything useful to tell me ?
look , i got a rule . i do n't talk to lawmen . dog-catchers neither .
i do n't see how we can ever find our way back from ...
what if it goes south ?
i told you already ... i 'm here to set you free ...
exactly .
would that include me ?
oh , really ? well , i 've quit better jobs than this one , believe me .
i ca n't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact .
damn right !

oh , waski , you do n't know anything .
how about these buns ?
i 'm not supposed to .
it 's not over , brynner .
english lit .
can he breathe under water ?
pankot is n't on the way to delhi .
now , that young conductor what 's his name ? that miracle kid , you know who i mean . von karajan ! but you called him something else . c'mon . what did you call von karajan ?
have i ? do you know when i come to think about it it 's staggering . if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals . imagine ! an important part of my life wasted between whistles .
it does n't matter , mr crane .
nothing is worth your life .
no .
look - sam , i 've been independent my whole life . i never had to ask anybody for anything . now you 're making me beg you for this .
nah , i got me a job .
you 'll see .
roy , remember , it is all within your power . the only thing that 's in your way ... is you .
through blasphemy ? you have corrupted the entire choir !
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level . once we get all the keys , we can unlock arcade 's heart . and then ...

kirk-unit , < u > why < /u > do you not disclose information ?
fuck him ! ! !
the sooner you get up the lab , the sooner you 'll figure it out .
oui . now you 've got me talking french .
antiques ? what the fuck do we know about antiques ? we rob post offices and steal cars , what the fuck do we know about antiques ?
why ?
well , it may be a joke , but it 's his nose . he ca n't help having a horrible great nose , it 's the only one he 's got . and his poor little head 's trembling under the weight of it .
what else you got ?
an ' you wo n't let nobody touch me ?
hi . hi .
what caliber is your gun ?
uh , no -- i 've never really found the time to settle down .
you got him too scared to peep , sheriff . maybe if you put that gun up --
ay me !
oh ch-ch-christ ... it do n't ... it do n't seem ... real ... how he 's ... dead ... how he ai n't gon na breathe no more ... n-n-never . or the other one neither ... on account of ... of just ... pullin ' a trigger .
not tonight .
no , thanks , i can manage .
pull over .
you know exactly ... what kind it is . come on rose ... what do you want from me ?
must be quite a pal , risk his own ass like this .
come on . i saw you on the net . why do you think i accepted this date ? you 're a sure thing !
sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it !
holy shit . who ? how many ?

philip , if you would rise .
you better get some sleep .
you killed her !

your whores never showed up .
for god 's sake , leave him alone , dad .
hold your breath . initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious .
arnie , this is crazy .
a show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions .
ohhh-hh , ohhh ...
obviously it 's some kind of screw up . the shipping records are n't a hundred percent accurate .
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ...
how come you never ask me any important questions ? do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ? or a cure for cancer ? what about your family ? what about people ?
that 's life . what can i tell you ?
naw , i do n't want to . me and karl got things we need to do .
and it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history . all you can do , kal-el , even now that you have ... found yourself ... is help them to evolve . set an example . show them they must strive towards the light . and ... remember us ...
i know the cruelty of such a fate .
no ! you take another step , i 'll shoot ! they 're trying to kill me ...
frank , please ...
get him home safe .
... are they hard to get ?
we 've got to disarm the bomb .
he 's a partner now , earl , like it or not .
when i deliver a message the very act of delivering it , you might say , gives it an official stamp , and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all .
listen to this , i love this part --
no , superman , of course not . you do get around , do n't you .
we crossed our own tracks .
arnold babar . is n't there a children 's book about an elephant named babar ?
see you around .
what about you ?
yes . are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand 's ?
i do n't know , what kind of question is that ? i mean it 's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me ...
that was my last .
it 's lovely . it 's just ...
no , i do n't think so ... wait . they 're not but ... something is . oh my god .
i did it ! madmartigan ! come here ! look ! you got ta see this ! i did it !
no game .

yes .
so we got to cut him fast . i figure from the x-ray it ai n't just the spleen . we also got to snatch his right kidney .
practice ran late . i 'm on my way .
i 'm tired of praying .

no one 's sure that he actually exists , but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by the bus station .
what ? because i 'm a little understand ...
nothing . i 'll have us back on the road in no time .
dmitri did n't want the money ?
so what are you doing with your life now , son ?
and you should be with your family .
no problem , master-c. if you 've seen one consumer electronics show ... what 's up ?
fifteen .
scattered reports , sir . rumors . nothing reliable .
you want me to try ?
but he 's --
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some .
why did she do that , jim ?
i want you guys to adopt the buglet . i wanted everything to be perfect . not shitty and broken like everyone else 's family . listen , once i have the baby , vanessa is going to finally be happy , and everything will be all right . believe me on this one !

yeah , its really different here .
well , he 's waiting in the anteroom for me now .
give me your wrist .
it looks wonderful . and so do you .
any bit in particular ?
jazz , let 's face it , it 's just an insolent noise .
it 's a white powder that comes in a vial .
i could n't care less . what i 've done is --
-tawny .
me neither . i heard he was eighty years old . i 'll be eighty next week . a good time to move on , do n't you think ?
please , you come too ...
wing attack , plan-r. that 's exactly what it says .
what are you talking about !
no ! you 're not talking now . you listen . you can send me away , lillian , you can pretend i 'm crazy and pretend i 'm still your little girl who ca n't take care of herself , but one thing you ca n't pretend anymore . you ca n't pretend i love you because i do n't . i ca n't . not after what you 've done to me . because you see ... i 'm still me ... i 'm trying real hard all this time to be me ... and you , 'little sister ' , you have n't been any help at all . okay , boys , i 'm ready .
you see , we have those oil interests in venezuela - and i just got a cable from dad - the board of directors decided on a merger .
he goes to a whorehouse every night ?
well ?
besides , you hired me for my discretion .
tricks ... jesus ...
but sean said ...

guess again , copper .
to most people , it 's an awful letdown .
i tell you it does n't exist !
yes i do . my family owns it . it 's ours . you do n't belong here .
yes money . adam had a five hundred dollar term life insurance policy .
you and i are , probably for the first time ever , in total agreement . he would n't just stop .
so , why did you take me up there ?
neither do i .
not a problem unless you 're gon na make --
five thousand now , five thousand on delivery . two women , one white and one black , as long as they have large breasts . hard bondage , or course . other than that , trusting your artistic interpretation , i have only two stipulations .
then you got ta have the talk .
my period .
my watch . he toyed with me . he sent me to chicago .
she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .
that 's what mama used to say .

i 'll do okay .
really do n't wan na be captured , el- tee . heard some bad things .
i do n't know . the guards say they 've never seen him before .
okay . she 's really pretty great , is n't she ?
so ?
yeah .
it could n't be any clearer .
who asked any ?
betty 's out of town so we 're playing next week .
well , uh , he dam well know he ai n't 'be-loved aunt winifred ' .
as suspected , the probe 's transmissions are the songs sung by whales .
you were their leader . they trusted you .
this guy 's on television ! alvy singer , right ? am i right ?
where did he say he was going to meet you ?
glad to see you again .
uh huh .
okay .
you were on a pilgrimage ? to new mecca ?
how are you , jerome ?
yeah , well , she and an architect are now a very definite item , which i still can not believe .
whoa , part 2. does it go to times square ?
you do not know what you are saying !
that 's where you come in . i 'll leave him in your hands , and do n't forget you 're supposed to be my niece .
any activity ?
oh sure . i know what people think . it 's like , oz , he 's just this kickass lacrosse player -- i also play football , by the way -- but that 's like ... not < u > all < /u > that i am .
well - i 'm ?
oh , no .
the resurrection business ? that may end sooner than you think . new laws may come .
so i noticed . never seen a `` captain '' quite so ready to leave her ship .
what is wrong , my darling ?
do you play ?
i 'm an orthopedic surgeon , she 's an orthopedic surgeon .
she said that ?
where do you meet ?
still , make a note i recognized that .
there 's dust in it .
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap . it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot .
okay , i 'll unhook you . no weapon .
yeah . ya see , i ordered that special .
i do n't want to make trouble . all i want is a drink .
oh , would you stop lying mother !
first thing we do , we get to detroit , we find glenn , then we find a window to throw him out of .
i think we can stop him this time . stop him for good . but we need to know where the bones were hidden .
uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , dr. gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st. catherine 's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ...
why would he do that ?
i 'm not worried . everything will be fine . the old team together . nothing can stop us .
i wo n't do your portion of kitchen cleanup .
so what was all this -- some sort of test ?
they should go one truck at a time . when the first truck gets through to the airport , then the others will follow .
is she ... dead ?
so do n't look in his eyes .
one more sweep ... one more sweep . i 'm getting tired of one more fuckin ' sweep . we 're been lookin ' for this thing for three days now , and found zip .
it was n't him .
even though a d-6 is too big , and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in . which makes it a peculiar choice . for a spare .
there were six of us ...
eleven and a half .
come on , spank , i 'm just trying to get by here . you remember how it was when you were starting out .
yes .
lloyd , i love you , okay ?
sure you do .
i do n't know . sure , i guess .
boy ! < u > somebody < /u > areound here sure has bad breath !
... well , there was some friction : i wanted to write up my work , educate the public , but koessler would n't allow it . low felt koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers . koessler had low reassigned to the pacific northwest , seattle . you know when they say , stick it where the sun do n't shine ? that 's where they stuck dick low .
it 's corny , but i could live with it .
i knew you 'd come . and i knew i 'd have to come up here and talk to you . i could n't let you go back without any word . i came to tell you again -- jessica can not be cured .
tank , it 's me .
and what , sergeant ?
close .
yeah .
we all know what right is , senator .
honey , you 've made < i > one < /i > mistake --
what things ? i 'm telling you , nothing 's going to change . i want to make you happy . that 's all .
shut up . stop . stop it .
whatever you say , dil .
no . two of them . two robbers . and they < u > both < /u > get nailed ... get shot by the old lady .
you promise to care for her then ?
that 's a nice score for a girl .
oh ... no thank you ...
this is a slur on her good name .
i did n't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention .
he 's got a reputation for doing all his --
and so do i !
you want to come inside ?
you would n't have a smoke on you , would you ?
what do you mean 'kinda ? '
mama , vos sos bien antigua . como lo va a matar con un picahielo . eso era en su tiempo , estamos casi ya en los ochenta . el lo va a meter un tiro , lo va a volar , le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima .
i used a variation . you should have anticipated that . have you figured out the message ?
disgusting .
i guess ... but you know ... i 'm american and i 've mostly been taught to be competitive ... there 's always pleasure of being the best ?
try . do me a favor . try . it 's your only chance . and hers , too . do that for me梐nd maybe we 'll be friends ? maybe . do we understand each other ?
it 's true . you 'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand , never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is .
all right , all right . break it up .
yes , sir !
okay . first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines .
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i was n't afflicted by that man 's violence .
what 's wonderful about the air , james ?
what are you doing here ?
who 's he ?
the kiss tickets , you nimrod ! they 're just fuckin ' gone ! please tell me you have 'm !
dr. gruber .
logan , do you see this ring ?
i 'm sorry .
he did n't look like he 'd take that sitting down .
i was in hell . i 've been there . it 's horrible . i do n't want to die , louis .
the what ?
pretty , is n't it ?
unh-huh . excuse me . i 've got ta go .
yeah , nice meetin ' yuh .
i doubt it ! come on , ken .
i 've a very pessimistic view of life . you should know this about me if we 're gon na go out , you know . i-i-i feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable .
we should have stayed and finished them off .
do n't try to con me , amado . you knew how they got all those things .
what are you saying ?
whatever . we 'll see . daddy 's gon na get her to bring a friend . we 'll both get one . i do n't care if i 'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends .
he 's vicious , doctor . besides , it 's against the rules .
what do you want from me ? would i swim across an ocean for you ? ... would i walk across the united states for you ? yes ... yes i would . you know that .
what ?
rose , please go away .
you 're standing in horseshit .
do n't give me a hard time , mr. gordon . i 'm just --
is your husband with you ?
yeah ...
you 're shaking . are you nervous ?
on the island .
maybe .
how much you figure that 's worth , skipper ?
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it .
better make that a certified check , walter .
who kills prince humperdinck ? at the end , somebody 's got to do it . is it inigo ? who ?
he has a six months lease , and has used up a little over five and a half months of it . quiet . drinks , but not to drunkenness . pays his bill promptly , with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale . keeps to himself , and none of the neighbors got close to him , or his wife .
mrs. robinson ?
positive .
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level .
c'mon , man , just watch me , watch and listen --
wait . what do you mean ?
i 'm okay -- i can walk .
i had you transferred to kigali .
... yes , and thanks to him , smallpox has been virtually eliminated . i 've heard this speech before .
talking helps . do n't talk , you get muddled in your head . hey ! now you just look at this here !
oh ! who cares ? we 're home !
now , try a running guy .
gabby , what is it ?
long enough .
you have n't heard ? andy 's dead .
no , stone !
yeah ...
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive ... ?
tell me why he 's dead .
put it on .
yes , the redoubtable paul . he has the plantation , and i , as you must have noticed , have all the charm .
something awful happened last night .
how wonderful for you .
sure honey , what 's the hurry ?
um , excuse me , sir , but the situation 's more complicated than that . the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has .
do you have any evidence against him , jim ? clay shaw 's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the quarter . he 's well connected , all his friends , the money , people , be careful , jim .
medicinal marijuana initiative . or am i being cynical ?
yeah .
you do n't believe in the force ?
that entrance is closest to the labs and the bee cages .
fuck the stereo . what 's that smell ?
there 's a few of us left .
the background is .
how 'd < u > you < /u > get in there ?
you have been given a higher form of happiness . the happiness you feel by serving others , by inspiring them to --
what are they peeking at ? captain waldowski in the shower ?
i told you before , grimes liked to be obvious .
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel 's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches ?
do n't forget , the girls change their names if they got married .
just a cough . sugar and a spoonful of jack 'll do it .
why ?
would you pose for me for free ?
i know .
it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
there is something i must ask the gods ...
what 's the matter ?

cynthia ! sure .
i just , i just ca n't believe it . i 'm minnesota 's american teen princess !
enzo , stop bitching , will you ?
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber , immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london . at such times marie antoinette has reassured me , she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her .
i can keep the beat .
this is wrong , alan !
what does it say ?
tell him to put the kettle down and i 'll give him money .
black . no sugar .
you 're great at taking the edge off a good time .
my scooter . i fell off . getting chased by photographers .
this young woman .
i did n't . she came to me a few days ago . to put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me . she thought you might lighten that burden .
you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .
do you know why i went after justine ?
we~re oetting hammered , jason . return fire ?
more popular than uncle 's day at a whorehouse . god damn , that morning sun is bright ! blue bright .

oh , i 'm to be blamed now , am i ?
how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .
we 'll take our check .
believe me , my old man 'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here . all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible .
okay , friend . start running .
look never mind . just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due . the hills have eyes remember ?
dr. ravell 's the finest surgeon on the staff . you must know him . he 's incredibly handsome , gentle , considerate . he 's being sued for sexual assault right now , but -- it 's not true . he was set up .
he 's been acting real strange lately . he wo n't even look me in the eyes anymore .
what ?
thank god he did .
depends on what you believe in .
come on now , we 'll talk about it at the table , dinner 's getting cold . what are you doing in here ?

a wriggle room ! maybe we should put that in the malibu house . screw the screening room !
art .
surreal ? strange ? nightmarish ?
beware the moon . the full moon , david . you 've got two days .
how many rooms do you think there are ?
these shoes are itchy .
if we put out the word . that we 're crewing-up , for a one-time-only job ... what do you think that 'll yield ?
well , what are we going to do about it ? where is he ?
now you stay put !
i ca n't reach her . too much signal break-up .
mom . are you ok ?
are you on the mercury mission ?
yeah .
you can .
it 's somehow connected with the worm that 's stealing the money .
i m not unhappy . frustrated maybe ... discouraged a little . it 'll work out ... .

oh yeah , thanks ...
yes .
meda . meda .
... we ca n't lose the wind ...
anything good ?
okay .
me ? nothing . tell me more about the job .
now listen here , you little bastard , just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in . alex eyes a giant white , fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him .
she called me .
bet you 're only eight and a half .
and you b-believe that .
mobile hq . in a blue funk . ca n't take chances . i 'm looking after things while he 's hiding out ...
do n't tell them where we 're going , sweetheart .
take my copy . you 're the toast of broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash ? strike that , a lot of cash .
oh , mom !
can you do better ? i did n't think so . this is a respectable business . nuthin ' wrong with it . get dat broom .
no , i do n't mean you have to . it 's just that we may not have enough --
oh , you did ? what am i expected to do條eap for joy ?
your serve . two -- eighteen .
lawyer says he can plead it down to five years . i 'll serve two .
you have n't seen anything yet .
i 'll call you back ...
yeah .
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain .
i know , i 'm sorry .
i am a creature of darkness . i require the shadow 's solace and the black of night ... sunlight is abhorrent to me ... i cover myself completely whenever i venture forth in daylight ... sunshine is my destroyer .
what 's the matter ?
fifteen miles . i 'll get your bags .
yup .
unlike a five , they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another . sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run ,
okay , newsman . how much you make a week ? you 're not talkin ' . you payin ' me ? what have you got for me ? we 're givin ' you entertainment ... what are you givin ' us ?
magruder does .

guy hit the shit outta that one , eh ?
what are you , hiding from the police ? show your face , you look great . does n't she look great .
shit , after what you 've told me , i do n't know . i should 've known , when he showed up dressed like some arty brat .
we rest , your honor .
well he ca n't have gone far .
no . no one special .
are you alone in the house ?
did we create his mind too ? not only can this man speak . he can write . he can reason .
you get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on ?
kiss my ass .
i 've also been thinking about the team . responsibilities , who should cover what --
those star destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed . you ca n't make the jump in this asteroid field .
goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people 's eyes . there 's got ta be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened .
no paris ?
a cleaning crew 's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- i think the power of the house fades at dawn .
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
what ?
well , what ?
they nailed the windows . i ca n't get 'm open .
oh , nothing out of the ordinary . growing old .
how ?
you 're him . corvis .
i want to find them too , but we ca n't do a bit of good right now . for every scary thing we saw in the daylight , i 'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night . am i right ?
all right , that 's enough . look , we 're all very impressed with andy 's new toy --
i do n't want a science lecture . you were on that observatory looking for trilithium . why ?
. yeah !
how do i look ?
i do n't know . i must have lost my punch . i did n't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up .
reting rinpoche has been arrested . he tried to overthrow regent taktra . today , he is brought back to lhasa by government officials . the monks at sera monastery have been on his side . now , there is trouble between them and the army .
is that why you and your friend split up ? because you wanted to be free ?
it 's okay..
oh george , this is bob zmuda . bob and i have been buddies for years .
why ?
i 'm not in trouble .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .
she 's ready to go .
you could n't ?
well , i know mom sure likes 'em !
the american theater does n't need people like that .
gim me a second --
relax .
you want somethin ' ?
oh yes , lovely funeral , gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job , lots of pink roses ... i used the white hearse . hey , how about this flowered wallpaper for your room ?
we catch a few hours sleep where we can . usually here at your bedside .
it was called 'slave of love ' when i bought it . next time it 's sold , it 'll be called something else .
if we do n't get out of here soon we can ask him in person .
i do n't know - i do n't remember anything that happened before the revolution . . .
should we be ...
combat operations center , major mandrake speaking .
with crocodiles ... everything 's even .
what do ya want with telly ? that guy has enough bitches .
right .
then who did ?
please sit down . i told your wife . i 'm sorry that we have to meet out here . i 've got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers .
what 's going on , logan ? !
those guys ai n't so tough . i fought plenty of guys tougher'n them .
well , everyone 's entitled to their opinion .
your fellow hero , untouched ...
jack ? jack ? do i look like a jack ?
and a very , very good one .
this is the starship enterprise , captain james kirk commanding .
argento 's good , but lewis is completely demented . we 're talking buckets of goo . red corn syrup everywhere . and fake brains up the yin-yang .
so he did -- but he has n't told you what he saw . i have .
brad . please do n't tell mom and dad ...
not taken .
general , the joint chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the soviets . you have signaled an escalation which i had no wish to signal , and which i did not approve .
christ . how 'd you get here ?
naw , nothing .
little nervous . wan na puke .
i do n't use cocaine anymore . if she says she saw me doing it she 's lying .
cuttin ' the heads off parkin ' meters , captain .
i ca n't get over how cute the girls in this city are .
my father would n't approve of that that
and a very bad gamble .
so finally he gives iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do .
when ...
tim , i 'll come back for you . i 'll get lex out first .
i think it 's more complicated than that little man .
do n't know -- broussard got hurt somehow .
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms , carrying official documents .
you said nobody came in here !
what else ?
the key ?
? !
what ? !
go ahead . make my evening .
is he your entertainment for tonight ?
position the long-bows over there , crossbows over there -- and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees ...
yeah . they were seen together in clinton in early september . the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive .
this is enterprise . we surrender . repeat enterprise surrenders --
who 's it , you mean .
calls for speculation .
how long to fix ?
stay in him forever ?
but you know i never killed nobody that did n't deserve it .
i talked to the army 's bureau of records . you 've never even been to viet nam .
well , let 's not be too sure , why is that ?
do you want rath or not ?
what are you talking about ? i am bloody skinny , pal .
10,000 gold crowns .
i do n't think those cops did iris . i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her .
i 'll never die . you tell the girls that . you honor our ancestors and i 'll be there . every night . at the table of life .
i 'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens , and it 's not gon na happen !
please allow me to demonstrate .
i韛e taken the liberty and had inspector thompson韘 office searched , as i believe you instructed . all clear now , sir . they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories ... poor man .
you know i love the dark . but there 's no dark anymore .
i quit workin ' for 'im , but just before i did , i ended up one night at a house ... i do n't know what it is they all think i saw that night , but i was just sittin ' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames .
i do not often think of the past .
nothing . only she may have tried to blackmail him . you know such things have happened . anyway , he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead .
i repulse you ? very well . it seems you have chosen your own fate . live with it ! i should say < b > die < /b > with it !
ooooh !
so what girls are over there ?
and the rest of 'em ?
she died giving you to me . and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves .
yes , yes , right .
... yeah .
well , i 'm going to read it anyway .
stop it --
this is un-fucking professional .
colonel . he had no sisters , no brothers , only a lot of love affairs .
i 'm saying he asked me out for coffee , like a real date , when was the last time you did that ?
ahh , the curiousity of youth ... on the road to ruin ! may it ever be so adventurous !
call off the manhunt looking for me . i did n't kill the transport guards .
how good it felt -
what ?
what are you talking about ?
there you go ... must you always spoil everything !
yeah . i liked being around you too ... claire .
no . i 'm just procrastinating . people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night . come on .
and if it ai n't cleaned off ?
what 's your bartlett 's ?
no , we 'll go through here .
at the gettin ' place .
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood , because of tea parties in the olden days , but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this ... like ...
just wanted to let you know you 're sitting in my chair .
tell him to put his gun down !
and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her ...
then we both know . i 'll point . you drive . faster .
do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window ?
yeah . exactly !
he does n't bite .
perfectomundo ! we are ready ! say , would n't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? think of all the time one would save .
someone who believes in miracles .
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country ?
i said , the northwest valley .
here we are . yeah , that 's a possibility . a movie . now you gwan in , tell your mother i got you back on time . point that out to her . she was always on my case for stuff like that . she 's still like that , right ?
what is it then ?
that 's great . it 's a great color for you .
no shit . it was all over the pavement .
how often does this happen ?
i was ... he 's gone ... i mean it 's not . it 's over , y'know --
kay . seriously . what if he actually means what he says ?
that 's my morning 's pay .
i am luke starkiller at your service .
this was a support group for men with testicular cancer . the big moosie slobbering all over me was bob .
stupid .
i 'd better press your evening clothes , sir . you have not for- gotten madame 's new year 's party .
geez , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile .
no , not yet . but you know paul . he 's sure to get it .
what happened to her ?
you are aware of the penalties for perjury ... ?
n-no , sir ?
rheya --
i know , i know . this never happened . you do n't exist .
the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away .
yeah ?
he was incredible . this guy is fearless . he has no fear .
like to who ?
he 's dead ? that 's fine . you wo n't see me shedding any tears over him ! oh george , you must take me with you !
he 's still here .
shapiro . shapiro .
which one ?
but they are human . they certainly become human with incredible speed . first they 're like they were in our memory , but then they fill in on their own . dna does n't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain , it 's not dense enough . they build up with experience .
turn it off ... .
look , why should it be yes or no ? ca n't we keep it going and see ? i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see . people do that , that 's realistic .
nothing is left but us .
i could have made it , you know . i did n't need your help .
pamela isley . i was so attracted to her i could n't reason clearly . i still ca n't . she used to work for wayne enterprises . find a file .
i 'm an idiot . i should have played the record first . this place is about to get burned down .
if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion , then i for one am fully prepared to do so ... al fresco .
i was married to her sister ..
sooner or later , we 'll have to try something .
we do n't have much time .
no .
phoenix ?
captain mertin , surely i am a god-fearing christian woman like yourself , but alas , i am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind . door knobs are too high , chairs are unwieldy , high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature . nor am i a marrie lady , captain . after all , who would marry a person of my diminutiveness ? so i am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist . why can not there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable ?
oh , of course . who can forget the emmy ? then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens .
i do n't want you to move .
well , these birds live in chimneys , you know .
no problem . she can have it . i hate mountains .
hey , i was only kidding !
it 's a special day is n't it ?
wake up , cole .
you 're not going to blame this on castro , are you ?
listen to me ! we do n't have much time . we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me !
i 'm not your uncle , kid . gordo , what are you doing here ?
has the observer from justice shown up yet ?
nine minutes !
wha -- you do n't want to know ...
he 's a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .
then i 'm a rich man .
no , bigger ! what 's the biggest energy ? ?
anyway , the reunion 's just the hook for the story . what it 's really about is how the typical small town 's changed in the last fifteen years . how do you like this a title : can you go home again ?
what ?
now , wait a minute . i know what you 're thinking -- but it 's not as bad as it looks -- matuschka it 's none of my business what you do , fran -- you 're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you 're a lady .
what time are you gon na pick me up ?
while he was here . you went about together ?
well , you are n't the president , dear .
i dunno . see if i have any connections .
well , i certainly would have heard about that .
you 're sleeping with her , are n't you ?
i do n't get it .
maybe you do n't know what it 's like where mrs. crawford comes from -- but i do . i came from a neighborhood just like hers . this is a whole other world for her . she 's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people . so , she puts on her best dress , fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible . being poor and having pride is not a crime , mr. dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness ' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics .
should we explore ?
doctor . ph.d .
have you seen a woman about so high ?
look , spare me the sermons , okay . you 're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed . you do n't even know me .
the fish saved my life . two years ago , i found out i had high blood pressure . so my doctor , he tells me to go get an aquarium , look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out .
the box , joey . he wants the box .
`` ... you have to believe in yourself ... ''
does anybody know what happened ?
maybe they should put me down too .
to explode , of course .
yes i am .
we 'll see about that ...
i 'll be fine .
i 'll think about it ...
yes .
what do you get out of this ?
thank you .
not that i know of . why ?
and what am i supposed to do with my life , huh ? i am 28 years old ! i work in a low-paying , low-status , zero-respect job which , unfortunately , i happen to fucking love . how inconvenient .
fifty years . the rep is known around philly , an ' a good rep ca n't be bought , but i do n't have to tell you that .
i 'm too young for coffee . can i drive the plane ?
i understand .
it does n't make sense . these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless .
i have a present for you . i did n't quite know what to get you -- anyway it 's a little awkward for me , shopping -- -- so here 's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something .
why not ? the whole of the british empire was built on cups of tea .
do n't be . they probably decided to explore each other rather than new york .
john levy , staff , and amy cain , press off ... .
keep it .
calvin klein 's spring line is atrocious . do n't you agree ?
you must be joking .
we 'll be there . listen , if he 's really caving in , we 'll go from there down to the office . i want him to commit his stock to us this morning .
sting ? ! sounds like something you put on a rash .
harry , if i gave you leo 's money you 'd have ray bones all over your ass and then you 'd be in a whole new kinda trouble .
i would do it again in a minute .
no . i was going to come up . i wanted to ask you to marry me .
pearl-handled .25 automatic , uh ? no , it 's a belgian gun ... 6.6 mm .
ca n't take the heat , get outta the kitchen .
now , if you 're ready , senator , we can start for the hotel . i 'll *see* that you get there .
mason , you have to take this ...
george weln is at the pentagon where the attack launched by the lone libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might .
sarge ?
well , we never made it official , so i guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend , but i was seeing him in school . i saw him at the mall about six months ago and i was too nervous to introduce myself so i followed him to his car , and jotted down the license plate number . it was registered to his mother , so i went to her house . she was so nice . i mean , she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz i never really spoke to her . i just waited til she went to work then i climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book . i say borrowed because i 'm going to give it back one day . but anyway , i called everyone in it til i found her son . he was n't home when i called so i left this message how much in love i was with him . i was , and how i wanted to have his children . just really opening up , and he never called back . i 'd call and call , and anyway , six months and two restraining orders later i just decided i deserved better . what about you ? do you have a boyfriend ?
yes , it is .
no , not at all . i mean , it 's all right . it 's fixed .
oh , that 's the beauty of it . these are free samples .
whew . you bounce right back do n't you ?
hey ... ai n't we getting near the next murder site ... bri ?
you do n't look sick , mr. stanwyk .
chinatown . sounded pretty cold ...
watts . those were his keys nell found . his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to . i think he 's here .
it does n't look much like the fish spears i knew back in marblehead..
look ms. heller , there 's something fishy here , and i do n't think it 's friday 's special .
this one 's almost thirty years old . it 's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love .
how was your evening ?
there are complications .
who ?
the letter writer is obsessed with you . his only escape may be ...
i 'm not going to change my mind , dad .
transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline . override the airlock sensors and hurry ! we 're running out of time , we have to get to the pods !
hell , you think i am ?
look at this .
yes ?
are n't you gon na go over and talk to him ?
huh ?
no , my friend knows her .
nice suit .
i do n't know .
tomorrow night as a matter of fact .
he 's screaming his opinions in my ear .
what is it ?
... fort william henry .
not exactly .
i 'm not making it up .
you and i know about this -- and that 's where it stops . understand ? it never happened .
maybe there 's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the quality cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us .
after five years .
this is bullshit , man .
what do you mean ?
hi . this is jack .
so am i .
sal maguda .
the other plate is currently in new york , in the hands of kobo 's man . find it for me .
was there blood ?
jess -- you look good .
then why 'd you come after me ?
never let it reach fifty degre-degrees .
claudia what ?
sure , you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there .
as you please .
uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , dr. gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st. catherine 's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ...
he says why did you send to russia for a wife .
must be nice . i wish we won the lottery . come up on a million dollars like ya 'll .
git .
i still do n't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you .
i ca n't even put a band-aid on my finger .
i beg your pardon ?
that 's right , miss packard .
you know i love you ... yeah ?
why do n't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here ?
get her the fuck out of here . get her out of here .
oh , yes ... well , that 's not so easy . beginnings are always difficult .
it 's dark in here .
i 've seen enough of this ! i loathe it !
harry ? i was just wondering , if there is anything wrong with vada .
sure .
you know , i 've always considered myself a very clever girl . smart . good head on my shoulders , that sort of thing , never the wrong word at the wrong time ... but then , i 'd never met addison dewitt . i remember once i had a tooth pulled . they gave me some anaesthetic - i do n't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way . i heard myself saying things i was n't even thinking ... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body , and could n't control what i did or said-
they had sabra and shattila .
speak ! go on . speak again .
and now that your mother 's dead ?
yeah , although i 'm not going to turn him in . i like hearing the dirt .
what 's the hurry ?
trust me , you wo n't have to .
the backseat .
this is from a scientist in france , madame sconce . `` the original werewolves were females . they became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman 's cycle . my suspicion is that the only cure is true love . ''
here 's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest , go into a church or railroad station -- but do n't go into nobody 's house , you hear me ?
do n't say that , rayford . do n't ever say that . he gave up hope . that 's where you got ta be different .
ha ha ! you said , i do . i guess that means we 're married .
communion .
lao she .
how long do i have ?
my mission is to study various solar systems , and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
well , think of it as playing a role . it 's fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
they had a warrant . they went through everything . they would have found it . i swear .
restin ' in our room . she ai n't been feelin ' well .
i ai n't heard of nothin ' .
ladies and gentlemen , the perfect meatloaf !

madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .

no , he 's not dangerous . not physically .
oh ... let 's see . there are organizations that think we wanted the `` sforza '' for reasons other than putting it in the da vinci museum we 're building in vinci . hopefully , these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica . if i seem vague , grand . we want a low profile on this , that 's why i got kaplan and the candy bars involved . i helped george help the mario brothers and gates help get you out ... .
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision , i think i 'd make a pretty good pilot . i 've good great reflexes . you need that for maneuvering , you know .

what 's his name ?

listen --
no , i ... i was just ... worried about her .
passing one-half light speed . the starboard nacelle 's running a little hot ...
i do n't !
that 's impossible . i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack , probably brought on by over drinking .
would he know ?
when you 've finished medical school and you 're on your own , you can do as you please . until then , you will listen to me .
it will .
what 's happening ?
i know but i felt like taking a shift .
what do they want from me ? what have i done that 's so wrong ? they act as though they do n't have their own peculiar things ... they do ! believe me . everybody 's got something ... even you probably have things .

history 's proven that where there 's a nitrogenizer , there 's a 12-legged signazoid . they use it to make our food digestible for their systems .
we can do all of that later , but first you need to calm down .

how long have you been standing here ?
what am i -- a dog , now ?
because i 'm trying to build your self-esteem . you 're far too sensitive .
i thought - ? is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life . no . not my favorite client . she 's going to make an entrance this town will never forget .
we probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck .

sorry , no . i just got one .
*i'm* just waiting for a street car --

but there 's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships . i just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system .
no , then .
it 's ok. you do n't have to say anything .
what happened ? were you kicked out ?

i do n't like the question .

put this on !
we stop we die . keep holding the thruster down tommy !
looks like we 're missing two . stone and kkinsa .

yo , blocker , what 's going on here ?
your own pleasure comes only after mine , when i desire it . i am the sole ruler of the dark world . there is no one to challenge my authority here . my word is the law -- all powerful . < b > no one < /b > is to challenge that authority , < b > no one ! < /b > . is that understood ? it is my command .
we lost him .
come on , junior . everyone 's waiting for you , son . the beam of light catches junior 's face . he is crouched inside the machine at lane six . jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy .
that 's him . simon doucet .
from where you stand , maybe . but i 'm standing over here now . i was rattin ' on myself all them years and did n't know it , helpin ' punks like you against people like pop and nolan an ' ... .

starfleet signals , sir , growing in strength ... they -- have intruder on their monitors -- it 's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate ...
what 's this ?
try and live a lifetime before friday . cram it all in .
i say it 's poetic . pure calypso , brother . the devil 's trumpet blowin ' the notes o ' doom for the devil 's troops . ha ha ha ha ha ...
well ? you meant well ? people always mean well , they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that ...
next time try `` fat and haggard . ''
i 'm a welder .
did you want to see her about something important ?
we are concerned about more than casablanca . we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance , waiting , perhaps , for a leader .
in one goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ? you coulda been nailed .
and keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . how could you be so careless ?
`` i found a million dollar baby ?
are you sure you can drive ? you 've really had a lot of alcohol .
* john g. was clever . he took the dead man 's gun and replaced it with the sap that he 'd hit me with . he left my gun and left the getaway car . he gave the police a complete package . they found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man 's hand , and they only found my gun . they did n't need to look for anyone else . i was the only guy who disagreed with the facts , and i had brain damage . *
please .
sure .
i figured it out .
do you want me to take his leg off ? where 's the fourth ?
we wo n't tell anybody - not even josephine .
a mark , huh ?
reluctant to speak , eh , chauncey ? well , i can understand that . when a man loses everything , anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time . just give it some thought , work with the idea , i 'm sure you 'll have plenty to say in a few days .
and we did n't have to bring another present ?
i 've got to make news , if i have to bite a dog . hey , kelly ! oh , mi gosh , even he walked out on me .

you are n't going to hurt me . you are n't going to hurt anybody any more . any violent gesture will seem ridiculous -- to yourself !
seven dwarfs ?
thanks a lot .
doctor acula ? i do n't get it .
i kind of got that impression .
what ?
you could say something like , `` tell me what the scumbag 's name is . maybe we can work something out . ''
god , i think josh is too mature for us .
i think it went on rather too long .
you 've got me all wrong . i do n't charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable ...
you do n't get two chances with junior .
perhaps this will help .
so friday at eight ?
i do n't know , forum 's pretty hot tonight . it might be hard to get in , though .
i have one simple request -- sharks with friggin ' laser beams attached to their heads , and it ca n't be done ? remind me again why i pay you people ? what do we have ?

luck ! whaddya mean , luck ?

you were right . i get it . you 're not the marrying kind . you 've made your point . goodbye bruce wayne .
< i > the fbi was breathing down lateesha 's neck ... and she assumed that they were onto our scam . so she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist . they have been under fbi surveillance for the past 6 months. < /i > < b > int . chevy suburban < /b > claremont drives like a maniac .

what are you gon na do ? how are you gon na help ? i 'm losing my mind . i do n't want to have you watch me fall apart .
you would have met in some shower eventually ...
buff is funny , okay ? she likes buff , so why do n't you whip shut the feminist hole .
... was so romantic .
no , i never . i would not do that , george . never .
that ... sawing and hammering .
keep my terms and i wo n't be your enemy .
and now i 'm paying for it , right ? that what this is about ? `` i told you so ? ''
ah ! let us begin !
how come you 're leaving ?
478 ...
well , that does n't matter ; that part never interested me anyway . the beatnicks were before my time , and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope , clich閟 and the clap . but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl .
yeah , he 's funny that way .
no , dignan . it 's not your gun . it 's all of ours .
thanks .
i do n't think so .
it could n't have been out at glades , if that 's what you 're thinking . i was never out there .

i 've got a line on one .
i have a big deal coming up that 's going to make us all rich . george , you remember that night in martini 's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans ?

so where should i put it ?
nice meeting you .

what kind of work do you think you would be qualified for ?
yes .
all right , i get it . i have bad teeth . you have to understand , in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth . it did n't matter .
oh . what 's happening about the opera ?
so , if the party starts at eight , why are we first going to a bar at ten ?
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel ?
what are you doing ?

partly . but there 's a lot the insurance does n't cover . that 's one of the reasons we have a lawyer . to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest .

this guy 's dangerous , let 's think of something else .
i think you need to speak for yourself , ryan . but i think you 're really nice people ...

... drink it .
merrick ...
that is the general idea , yes ...
probably .
anyway , even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence . if i did n't know better , i 'd swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination .

randall .
remember , pay attention to how she talks about foley , her tone . do it right , she 'll tell you things she would n't tell burdon . tell her you think he 's a nice guy . no , first tell her about being in the trunk with him , in the dark for half an hour , and see how she takes it . if she 's in on it , what does she get for all the aggravation ; cops breathing on her ? i bet nothing . so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out . you think that 's possible ? what kind of guy is he ?
dick , do n't ...

i know a couple .
there 's been a rash of them , recently . i find it a little unnerving . in fact marco called a few months back , and he wanted to see me , and rehash the past as they say , and i was n't really up for it . do all men go through this ?
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation .
no . i think it 's ugly .

we did a pretty good job of pissing them off .

but i 'll tell you , he knew how to bring in the crowds . he knew all the fuckin ' angles . he brought over the whole 'femme fatale ' show from paris . but he forgot how lazy them european dancin ' broads can get . i mean , he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they did n't blow up like fuckin ' balloons .
she would not sleep with me the other night , you know , it's-
thank you .

or a vegetarian ?
it 's a sin against god for me to refuse your kindness . but my heart 's held fast here ...
i never got lost . for some reason , i 'm more at home everywhere than at one place . so i decided i 'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen . i belong everywhere and nowhere . i 'm kin to everyone , and no one in particular . see , once you get into the habit of not needing anyone , it 's kind of hard to break .
sorry to disappoint . i 'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind . you 're right , it was nunez . any more questions ?

nothing , nothing ... look , i live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up .

that ship was lost in deep space , seven years ago . if the titanic sailed into new york harbor , i 'd find it more plausible . houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team , investigate the source of the transmission . if it really is the event horizon , they 'll attempt a salvage . we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship 's systems for the salvage crew ...
and < u > what < /u > is bigger than a triumphal homecoming ... ?

then you < u > do < /u > think i 'm insane .
uh-huh .
is that right ?
i 'm surprised at you , tom . if there 's anything certain ; certain in life ; if history has taught us anything , it 's that you can kill ... anybody . but perhaps your relucatance is because you 've come to tell me that you 're moving your family to vegas , that you 've been offered the vice-presidency of the houstan hotels there . or were n't you going to tell me at all ?
i left four messages . you do n't return my calls .
we 'll just head up here into bishopville , get checked up in the hospital . then maybe we 'll head off to hollywood after all , huh ?
i have the ... strangest feeling i 've met you before ... a long time ago , perhaps . were you ever ... ?
instead you 're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke ? skylar no , so i can be a doctor .

you have no disputes over women ?
right .

john mitchell resigned as head of creep to spend more time with his family . that does n't exactly have the ring of truth . howard hunt 's been found -- there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag .

but he has nothing to do with it !
is that right ? well good for you , sull , i 'm proud of you .
poor father . . .

and what if you track down these men and kill them ? what if you murdered all of us ? from every corner of europe , hundreds , thousands , would rise to take our places . even nazis ca n't kill that fast .
i 've seen you before . i like your paintings a lot . your hair was different .
where 's everybody else ?
do n't think about it . you 're exhausted .
do you have something around back , facing away from the road ?
where did you say she 's from ?
i lost the touch
*you're* a doctor , homer -- you do n't smell like ether .
are you okay ?
ok , boys , which of you gets the privilege ?
well , that sounds fine to me .
agreed .
the important thing is not to let on that you know anything . we want to try and find out where they are . now i do n't want to get too personal , but do you have a good relationship with your wife ? are you close with her ?
yeah , uh , just a minute
he 's after me .
i 'm fine . you rest .
do you own a car ?
anything goes wrong , head for your homes , just sit tight -- you 'll hear from me or howard .
because you 're pushing me to be something i 'm not .
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you ... tell me a little about her . she got great tits ?
we do n't have a maid any more .
yeah , well ... maybe you better talk to one of these others , okay ?
all right . here .
do n't bother , sefton . i do n't like you . i never did and i never will .
what do you want ?
that 's not right , really , cuz i ...
the cusp of my life . what i was , what i am , what i will be ... past , present , future , all bound here at this timeless moment of decision . i was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures . opening the box was my final act of exploration , of discovery .
it was a ouija board , remember ?
huh ?
hal , unless you follow my instructions , i shall be forced to disconnect you .
oh -- do n't forget tomorrow we have dinner with wade cooksey .
i hope you 're comfortable .
no . that 's the reason they chose me -- i remember things .
i 'm the only left , dick . if you do n't talk to me , you ...
i have confirmed to you my address , that 's all i 'm required to by law to do . we have broken no law .
because you 've changed so much .
your aunt ?
do n't tell me we got ta go back out there ?
it 's high time you realized , honey babe , that a woman does n't have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language .
what was it . what was it , honey ?
tie them that they may watch .
we 've got to , brad , everyone 's watching .
she 's still working ?
do you have any idea what this means , simone ? our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it .
if i 'm so far from the truth , why is the fbi bugging our offices ? why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ? why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before ?
there . you see the guy sitting on the porch ? the old ladies and one guy ? you know they 'll have a couple more in a car somewhere .
he sends his apologies .
but . . . how could you beat him ?
good old frank . and how is fat mr. grease monkey these days ?
-- uh ... buzz , i 'm sorry , i -- buzz , you got ta forgive me ! i should n't a fired you , i did n't know what i was doing ! i was a little funny in the head , i --
you 're kidding .
what does this have to do with sid ?
i do n't wan na work at all .
he had fish , too .
we 've secured the doors on both levels .
sure . you抳e got to play them against each other . otherwise they think you抮e easy .
i do n't know what i 'd do if i could n't paint anymore bud . i just do n't know what i 'd do ...
who 's who ?
well , that 's very interesting .
i do n't believe this . it 's a miracle , michael . a miracle .
why is he hiding ? why is he a janitor ? why does n't he trust anybody ? because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most !
i 'm so glad you could come . here we are , all together again .
you spotted them , huh ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't just leave it at that . the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something . as ship 's counselor , it 's my duty to-
... absolutely not .
i 'm so sorry if you were offended !
what 's this ?
i said okay ?
no , take it .
c'mon , billy . i 'm trying to work for god 's sake ...
but i understand her . that may be more important .
what do you mean `` grand theft auto ? '' this is insane .
you know , we should 've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart . i bet we would have got on famously .
no ! it 's you , loki ! i should never have listened to you !
to urbana . it 's a hundred miles .
you 're not listening . people are going to look at the ashes of westerburg and say there 's a school that self-destructed not because society did n't care , but because that school < u > was < /u > society . is that deep or what ? i 'll let you put it in your diary , babe . free of charge .
no .
is there anything you want to tell us , honey ?
fine . this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group 's activities .
just another part i 've got to learn .
what , sir ?
bank ?
shall we have another ?
i have money to give you .
otherwise . i trust you know the difference . you 're an intelligent woman , finished at nyu .
yes . kill me . kill me like you promised -
okay , `` mom . ''
how do you spell her last name ?
if you believed , you would n't be walking around with a handgun in your belt . what does that tell me ? you want to make the night come down .
how many do you want ? a thousand ?
you 've been cheated , do n't worry , we 'll take it back .
yes . he seeks a levy of troops and money .
the bottoms of your feet are covered with salt .
i think i can remember what 's on them .
what are you thinking , calling me at home with a message like that ? you 've compromised me and our relationship --
for food and clothes , and all that grows , etc , etc . dear lord , thank you .
not yet , mr. clark .
yes sir , they ?
police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .
wan na hear something more impressive ? my first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager . my girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the olympic . says maybe you < i > could < /i > take me .
the money that makes you mr. clark brandon . let 's you live in a penthouse , on top of the vancouver royal . lets you own a cruiser . lets you do as you please , go where you please . you big , open-handed , generous guy . that 's the kind of money it takes , is n't it ?
how did you get that bracelet ?
yeah-well , you wanted to keep the relationship flexible , remember ? it 's your phrase .
yes . i understand there are different varieties , it that true ?
can i ?
sometimes i paint .
no .
he does it all by himself .
your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful .
do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness ?
jesus fucking christ .
how do you know ?
ooh gross .
bench seats .
yeah but please do n't do that : everyone would be looking at me .
what value is that ? you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past .
as an unmuddied lake , fred . as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer . you can rely on me , fred .
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago . that 's why micom wants onsite assessment .
i 'm gon na kill you .
good .
i 'll need a room over there that faces this way . how much a week ?
life , huh ? they step outta line again , we 'll shorten up that sentence real fast .
uh , with all due respect , sir , dr. long told me to prep the field for detonation at ...
some snowy night in front of the fire ... in the meantime , while we 're on the subject , will you check about the hors d'oeuvres ? the caterer forgot them , the varnish was n't dry or something ...
maybe . but i still need to talk . do i have time for a cup of coffee before i go ?
take me back , put me to bed ; i surrender . we 've done enough damage tonight .
ah , yes , which reminds me , who here thinks they 'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs ?
i know what they can sleep through , erin . i probably know it better than you .
i do n't think so .
carl 's a fiddler . what 's he doing coaching piano ?
... how did you get into marine salvage ?
you 're bothered by your performance on the < u > kobayashi maru < /u > .
teldar 's shooting up . buy any for yourself ? bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office .
is there nothing men can do ?
dupont circle .
i have n't any money but i 'll get a job and --
it seems to me we are just sailing away . they have n't sunk us yet , have they ? besides , do n't you worry your pretty little head about that . it 's all been taken care of .
l-lies ... at first . about how you was just passin ' through and did n't kill nobody ... an ' little bill kept askin ' questions , mixin ' him up , catchin ' lies ... an ' then he 'd beat on ned an ' ned would cry and lie some more an ' then ... then ...
are you okay ?
no .
welcome to the new bureau . nobody shares information anymore , it 's become synonymous with job security .
the blue .
oh .
you were attacked . my god . should i call a doctor ! did you call the police ...
what have you done ?
now you need approval from him to go home ?
topol .
yeah , that 's what i think .
you ought to stay over . you always wrote a good hanging story , hildy .
that does it ...
john hinkley . the guy who shot reagan . he only had two names .
in the crawl space , with the rats and the casks of amontillado . come on . up .
i ai n't really thought about it too much i do n't reckon .
were the leads insured ?
no you wo n't .
it will work out .
it 's not your fault . mrs. kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny .
yep .
i 'll try . . .
you 're my olympic event .

scream .
we 're outta here --
hello ?

what happened to him ?
here are your flight coupons . call me from the road if there are any snags . your itinerary ...
but it must be done ; your government is paralyzed .
well , i ca n't make any promises , and of course i have n't read the script but i loved the novel ... when are you shooting ?
you sure you do n't want to eat something ?
not much chance of that now . the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it ...
... and then we 'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and ... and we 'll ... then you 'll sleep over and then in the morning ... ... you 'll be distant and you wo n't be ... able to stay for breakfast ... you 'll just have some coffee maybe ...
i wo n't be making the trip .
you 're going home . i 'm sending a radio call for the boats . we 'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them .
we 're all set , sir .
`` our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long . some skeletons of squids ...
how much you got ?
the whale ! how could i forget ? always was something fishy about that woman !
please , hurry ...
then he called me a faggot .
the best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head . you do the right thing . you authorize me . right there . whatever it costs .
he does n't do it in front of me , but he does it with mother . you know what he called father one time ?
but you always said things were so great at the academy ... what happened ?
i 'll come back all the time .

it 's you ... irena ... my friend !
you see , wilhelm , i 'm talking about ordinary , everyday reasons . which is why i want to discuss your private life . how many illegitimate children do you have ?
i see your point . what 's the favor ?
you thought the deceased might ... break his promise ?
i had something a little different in mind . instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly , why do n't you get him to show you what he 's been working on after hours ?
then let 's get goin ' . we can argue on the way . you tell me what you need ... ... i 'll make sure you get in .
get out .
sloan never told us she had friends like you .
i 'm just telling you i ca n't cut him up .
you smell like coconuts .
pardon me , i 've had a few things on my mind -- like putting this safari together .
hanover ! ! hanover ! !
it 's alice .
peggy sue 's still stuck on treble without a cause .
[ he 's the man , 'the boss ? ' my guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots . we had to inject the whole barrio . we bugged the house and stole the picture of him . ]
it 's a word . killing them ... his delusion is : if he sees himself accepted enough times , he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time . and he would record it somehow . so he can see himself received over and over again ...
but i ai n't got you ...
forget it , egghead . i 'm good as is .
fuck me . let 's go home .
you following me ?
that 's not gum in your mouth , is it ?
jack . what are you doing here ?
good night .
just what did you get yourself into , jimmy ?
i 'm not stopping . i 'm on my way .
bad last moment - i cut it out .
what do you think of that ? or this ?
i know a lot of men who did n't do anything till they met walter burns . please , dear .
i can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing . that 's why i need you , case . you 're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences . my `` ice '' as you call it . i 'm doing everything i can to make that possible .
it does n't matter .
i know .
hi , want to take up dancing ?
it 'll get ya high .
get it , and put the money in it . pack up anything else you want to take with you .
so ? tell me : how come they call you `` freb '' anyways -- ?
i hope it will , yes . i 'm sorry .
kind of .
thank you , sir . quite a cigar , mr. potter .
what ? ... maybe ... no ... i dunno ...
we 'll stand the watch on deck tonight . you 're up first .
yeah ...
since i was a child , i抳e always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldn抰 rescue me from the kidnappers , i knew i had to form a new alliance .
but why ?
wait ! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent .
and i too .
do n't touch her . call 911 .
mother , i only --
christ , ken , you know it 's not that easy .
you < u > ca n't sit < /u > ! you got ta walk around , with good posture . you want these people to think we have class . otherwise they 'll < u > never < /u > invest in our movie .
gee , let me think . `` do you want to ... '' is that the best you can do ? some tired hand me down rehash ? hey , pal , no one 's gon na write a book about you . no movie rights . nothing . i 've been through this before and much better i might add .
four grand . for the hospital . is that enough ?
you should call your grandmother .
smells like teenage spirit .
i ca n't screw . i ca n't screw .
do n't make me angry , peck .
i said poker 's an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .
absolutely not !
i think a little of both .
i think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you . and when you thought i was being kicked around , i wish i could 've seen your face .
we did our utmost to have it set ahead .
hi , how are ya ? < u > listen < /u > to this , willya ...
you get the money ?
by that time the game will be over .
me ? that 's why the bosses sent me out here . they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint . like these two fuckin ' balloon-heads over here [ eddy and jerry ] . they were gon na try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin ' grand ? yeah , right , i 'm sure .
i know ; this a long way from watts . but what i like about living out here is that you do n't hear no helicopters , no sirens , no drive-by 's , no nothing . just peace and quiet . listen .
ok , ok. you gon na make me something to eat at least ?
the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash . that was death 's original design .
i have complete faith in you . but do n't you go speeding .
here . take my card . wait a minute ... here 's a special one . for top-shelf clients .
should be over there .
you got a better way up ?
some .
to the stars .
pretty good . he sent them out videotaping outcrop .
... and her heart stopped and she was n't getting oxygen .
the master is not yet married . nor do i think he ever will be . we are simply his servants .
yeah .
there must be something ...
i figured , what 's the point ? i knew i 'd just be taking my problems with me . once the kids came along , it made me look at seahaven with new eyes . i realized , what the hell could be better than this ? i 'm telling you . what you really need is someone to carry on the `` burbank '' name .
well , i do n't notice us hustling trash , either .
i 'm sorry , dude , but桰 ?
no one . your property . it would prove your case . why do you think kissinger 's taping your calls ? for history . his word against yours -- and right now he 's got the records .
... across the border . come on !
you keep on saying `` deep '' and `` deeply . '' i wish something good would happen on the surface sometime .
yes .
well , i 'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear .
you did . yesterday you said , and i quote , `` i have a date with roger from op/ed tonight and i 'm going to do it with him . ''
... and a license to kill ...
yes .
yeah ?
i must say , q , you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement .
it 's mine all right .
damn straight .
i mean , i suddenly have immense physical power , and the ability to crawl up walls --
-- red nose and ears . i know , i know .
now how far would further out be ?
i 'd rather be his whore than your wife .
yes . something ... conservative .
my dear , you do n't know how impressive i could be . did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels ?
lauren 's not my wife .
yes . i mean that 's it . i wan na feel like a man with her . i wan na feel like the only man with her .
yeah , let 's go .
do you go to school ?
and this is what you rented ?
eh , there 's only three of them .
she brought my digestive enzymes .
that 's a very handsome sword you have there .
did you download corey ? in san jose ?
you do n't understand this guy .
please , mom . at least consider it . you should get away . you should n't be alone now ... .
i 'm driving you crazy ? no . you 're driving me crazy . we had a dream . what happened to our dream ?
oh , what ? i offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it 's `` sexual harassment ... ''
do n't fret . it 's only his dream . dreams are n't catching , not like measles .
no sauntering down the aisle . just make time . let 's just get there .
on the dog watch , night after the storm , i look down into the skylight above skipper 's cabin and there she was , peelin ' down .
do you want anything ?
sonny 's a fuckup . if he pulls this off , fine -- life goes on . but if the cops end up with those disks , we cut our losses .
we insist .
just gettin ' rid of the garbage .
take a message .
you what ? say 'gain .
she 's my gynecologist .
yeah ...
i can run the image through a series of filters , try to clean it up .
yes , i 'm a jew . but i like to think first i 'm a human being .
shut your mouth . nick cardella was provin ' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy 's nutsack . what sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on nick cardella ? nick cardella 's a stand-up guy .
has she spoken to you of her father and her mother ?
quit . he 's too good .
and then i ... right .
they 're okay . bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste . but then sports came out in 1983 , i think they really came into their own , commercially and artistically .
oh for shit 's sake , ted , you are the most selfish human being i have ever met . no wonder she said you came first , then billy , then , if there was anything left over , she got the scraps .
you worry too much , stevens . i have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted .
just a little .
how come ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ?

what are they ?
for starters . it 's also got fennel , asparagus , olives , some more of mother nature 's aphrodisiacs ... back in college , me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew .
so what should i do ? call the police ? you think they 'll believe me ?

i hate it . i 'm so happy , becky . finally i feel happy . this is right . this is real . everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts . please do n't tell anyone about what happened . `` sleepless in seattle '' is history .
you mean taking bribes , and skimming busts and letting hoods walk ? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe ?

naw , i 'd just blow it .
... and teeth ... and she 's like this little bunny cowering in the corner ...
well ... well ... okay .
what was that , i did n't hear ...
i understand that you 're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts . i 'm not that skilled as president . oh sure , i put up a big front -- -- not that everyone 's buying it .
no -- that 's atmosphere . cloud layer .
sure we keep records !
well , not exactly .
the first two were stabbed without thought . the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
says you were a slob , leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake .
do you know how to open the safe there ? our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe . you must open it .
promise me you 'll read those contracts by then .
it could have been an accident ... .
well , i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death 's back . so , tell me , fellow war-monger ... do you think princess bala likes men in uniform ?
you mean you 've actually begun some ?
yes .
one of the maids-in-waiting for that elizabethan group .
i 'm sorry .
why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ?
it 's all right -- look .
but why does n't it matter that we 're not the same people we used to be ?
i 'd just like to know your opinion of him . in general . just how dangerous is he ?
that 's not the whole story . the mexicans that know , that remember , understand what buddy was for their people . hell , it was mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him .
i grant you your wish if you grant lady guenevere hers .
i think the photographer 's probably a voyeur .
you love him , do n't you ?
good man . and is she all right ?
when you get up to a hundred , wake me up .
who else were you expecting ?

i , ah ... did n't catch your last name .
always wanted to rob that casino , rudy . way back when i worked there . what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me .
it is not allowed .
in fact it 's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs . a completely successful fabrication of the past , the ploughman 's lunch was .
it was great .
then we should ...
i know -- i know .
i beg your pardon . li mu bai and i are n't cowards .
baby ! rodeo drive .
hey , sweetheart . what you up to ?
madison lives two blocks from their present location .
no , ma'am , he just wanted us to quit . making it through was kind of an honor . some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight , command would consider you at the top of the class .
where ... where am i ?
the bridge is fine , taylor , how are things down there ?
why ?
-- no , it 'll help me , really --
well , actually , < u > you < /u > have proof . could you walk a little faster please .
that 's new territory for us ... but yes , we can look into that . explore shelter possibilities , funding bodies . we could -
what if i was vince ? you 'd be dead right now . what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?
please , rose . i 'm curious , that 's all , i have a natural curiosity , it 's only human . you 're my friend , are n't you ? do n't you like me ? i like you , rose , a lot -- in fact , i love you .
believe me , i 've done everything possible short of asking agnes .
i ... given the limits of your question , that 's correct .
i 'm sure there 's more than that ... fucking pigs always travel in packs ... ... here , take this .
at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .
he was my father 's best friend !
you 've been so great . i just feel a lot clearer about things .
no one 's asking you to !
where are you staying ?
do n't screw with it . it makes us look suspicious .
dad - - dad - -
jesus , i do n't know ...
you 're a smart brother ... you should dig what huey and bobby got to say ...
they turned me loose from the state hospital .
sailor , you are somethin ' else , honey ... when i was fifteen , mama told me that pretty soon i 'd be startin ' to think about sex , and i should talk to her before i did anything about it .
i dunno . he 's got his ways . he knows margaret .
like i give a shit . they all want me , as a friend or a fuck . i 'm worshipped at westerburg and i 'm only a junior .
well , game five was the big one . it turned in the bottom of the 6th . we were down 3-0. cleon jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball . clendenon comes up . the count goes to 2 2. high fastball . he nailed it . weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie . jones and swoboda scored in the 8th . we won , pop .
i was a musician .
'have a look ?
come one , that was so weird .
africa ? that 's so far ? how do they get here ?
well , i could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now .
what is it now ?
i did n't .
dad ...
pal , she 's a big girl , you know ? i 'm sure she 's alright .
so , marty , let me tell you about these nurses ...
i do n't like to talk about it .
really .

a third stage guild navigator will be here within minutes !
oh , yes i would . i 'd know you any time --
where are you hurt , son ?
but it 's what we want .
you have another choice .
do you have a back up .
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky .
you 're my woman , you understand ? you do n't let anybody take you away from me without a fight .
no problem .
where are they gone ? you know where they are ?
well , i 've had a hard time getting an actual verification . a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there , but i checked it out and what happened is , he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul , so ...
i thought it would make more sense . i 'm getting the pieces , but when i put it together it feels like ... like you 're telling me about somebody else 's life ...
i saw an interesting thing today . a man was being arrested by the military police ; probably an urban guerrilla . rather than be taken alive , he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket , taking the command vehicle with him .
my skip-trace turned up two cecil stipes . one 's in butte , montana . other 's at riverhead veterans psychiatric .
because ... well , that 's what he does . he 's a very powerful man .
hal ?
right ?
i know . he was to take the fucking money .
you were n't helpin ' .
what your father did does n't condemn you .
my my .
what are you doing that for ?
i 'll provide you with transportation .
i know , but that was before .
no .
have they done skin testing for allergies ?
okay ?
a rest ?
hey ... cy ... what now you a righteous panther man , you too uppity to drink with us ?
oh , that makes it okay , then .
she 's asleep .
i know who you are .
... and by you , mrs. peel ...
by our time . you 've turned gray .
copy out from here ...
how so ?
she 's a friend of mine
it 's all right . bring him in .
... yes .
do n't you worry . we 're just having a quiet sunday at home .
i am going to do you a great favor . i am going to take you with us to gitarama .
please .
hey , jack , real men do n't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but i was fantastic .
horror flicks . b-movies from milton 's heyday .
no , caesar , gim me the gun .
why you think is today ?
okay , okay . you join him . but first will you ask if he 's here ?
who ?
what about the hotel staff obstructing us . israel 's obviously paid off the management .
languages . i was already fluent in nine languages .
i do n't give a shit about-
patkin was a tribute to baseball ...
i 'm aware of that .
christ , what a night ! not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road !
carl . friend of yours from high school . everybody calls him `` cueball . ''
what do you mean `` what am i afraid of ? ''
of course . it 's the way any decent man would feel in your position .
a lot of works .
did you hear me ?
no one 's discussing it . i 'm just gon na run micheal home . i 'll be right back .
you being cute ?
i 'm always here , pete .
there is more in the diary than just the map .
the human condition .
ayuh , only it 's early , i need a drink to wake me up .
what sort of plan ?
tommy ...
who ?
gentlemen ... may the wind be at our backs . stations please !
cut it out , before you break something !
a hundred per cent cotton . okay , here we go , andy .
who had to put a gun to your head ?
look . i 'm warning you .
stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward , kitty . y'oughta start looking for the others ...
this is how you wan na spend the time , then go , go , go -- you 're gon na be surprised at what a waste it is -- `` the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me , '' chapter three --
and they do n't call my parents ?
speak to your friends for me , jessica ... please ...
yes , of course , he knew , but at the time , he felt -- we both felt their existence was ... an insignificant variable .
no ! not yet ! let me hug it and kiss it a little . let me run my fingers over its lovely skin . let me climb to the top and sing to it .
come on . stay up there , cozy girl ...
i know , but i 've been thinking --
you think you 've found your calling ?
well , that 's the state 's offer . if you plead to possession and tell l.a.p.d . what they want to know , your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars . if you do n't , l.a.p.d . will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight . if you do n't post it or do n't know anyone who can , you 'll spend six to eight weeks in county before your arraignment comes up .
who ?
i have to warn you , mr luca , he 's going to be at least a head taller than you . prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time .
of course ! you want out ?
with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
yeah ?
a fierce magazine ... brutal ... an angry magazine ... a war magazine ... a mercenary magazine ... fierce ... mad .
my birthday is april 10 , 2015. how long do i live ?
su-ure . two people hired me to find zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and colleen threw a tizz when we took hers . obviously , all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty . but it 's not necessary . people are dead . one was a friend . the same people were involved in a scam to rip off grendel records . bottom line 's julian grendel is doing a little revenge number ...
across ninth avenue . dodgie 's . where you 've been getting your hair cut for fifty years . where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut . where jim rorty shot a man for cheating at poker .

he was about to un-stick me ! i paid you to help me get closure .

i 'm just doing some christmas shopping . it 's for my wife , no kidding . though , this is n't the < i > main < /i > present , it 's just , you know , a little --
but it 's the horror movies you 'll be remembered for .
i am a god ! a god !
there are only two ways out of this building . one is that scaffold . the other is in their custody . you take a chance either way . i leave it to you .

he *sniffs* that ether ! i 've seen him do it !
yes . he called some of the biggest people in town .
dad , yes . and i 'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now .
one day they 'll find a cure .
your bellmoth case . the fbi thinks there might be mob ties .
no . i admire you . i ... i fell in love with you the first time i saw you . i did . i think that you are the most --
so ... board convenes tomorrow , you 'll recommend , we close and it 's a deal , right ?
oh , that was phil , trying to give me advice on dating 70 's women . look i 'm so out of touch , i have n't dated women in ages , not since my wife died .
he is my sponsor . the general is the head of the secret police of honduras .

no . but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me , and i抦 a busy man .
then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass ... it 's ironic , is n't it ? you 're finally the perfect woman for him ... because you 're his science project .
i have a message for you from your `` niece '' , sir .
where is it ?
yes , but i lent it ...
were you going to make a suggestion ?
the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten . just like beauregard . one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision . the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact .
first i could n't feel it , but now i feel it easily , it 's like a little acorn .

right here . right here . < u > inside < /u > the magician . shhhh .
you are me .

well they have some of the coldest winters around , and i grew up there , near chippewa falls . once when i was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on lake wissota ... ice- fishing 's where you chop a hole in the --
you 're such a smart aleck ! nobody can do anything but you . i 'll show you how to stop a car梐nd i wo n't use my thumb .
questions ? well , heck , i 'll tell you anything you want to know .
i do n't see why i must justify myself to you . i do n't care about the things you do . i do n't care what 's happening in new york or los angeles . i do n't care about movies or tv . i do n't care who 's on johnny carson .
like following me around and pestering the people i work with was n't bad enough , but breaking into my apartment --
you heard me . you . congress and cabinet heads .
all right .
this is not right .
then i 'm glad i lost the bag ! i 'll write you the check immediately .

i 've been seeing stuff ... a lot of really messed-up stuff . do you know who grandma death is ?
hey , ed . did you hear about marcia ?
hello ? is anybody there ?
you got a tab ?
i mean , frank marino was there to meet him , but so were the cops . this time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in antwerp .
i 've got an idea .
no .
what is ? oh , dinner !
i 'm not playin ' myself no mo ' .
you 're happy , are n't you ?
as if it 's that easy .
it 's cool , but where 's the water ?
it went real good .
how do we do that ?
what do you think you 're doing ? go on , get out of here .
i 'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness , charles . and this one gets a front row seat .

mrs. kramer , did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband ?
including the death of your husband ?
oh dear .
nope . i 'm not really a wine gal .
was it my fault ? did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in ? i meant to be with you on our honeymoon , hildy -- honest i did .
i ca n't believe this .
burritos ... enchiladas ...
the flowers ... they 're beautiful .

you coulda picked up a tab every once in a while .
it 's choi .

i got contacts . listen tom , if you pointed them at me i 'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do . either way you still get the desired effect .
god , but i love that macho talk ! emergency generators ! the indian used campfires .
no .
and i suppose you do n't feel bad !
i 'm a national merit finalist . i 'm on the hi-q team and the math team . i 'm in the spanish club . i 'm a thespian . i 'm vice-president of my class . i 'm on the volleyball team .

i do n't believe you .
no . woodly the magic root you gave me -- i had it analyzed . it was discovered by a harvard botanist in 1893 ! he explored your famous jungle for five years , armed with nothing but kindness , a talent for languages , and a pocketknife .
i want to , palmer -- more than anything . but it has to be real . it has to be true .
you are master of all you survey .
winning is easy . losing is complicated . it 's a lifetime 's work .
ca n't be good news coming from you .
mmmm .
for me ? -- oh , please , something sweet and cold .
it 's yours ?
not just me ... it 's the way the whole thing works . people like elias get wasted and people like barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do , we just sit around in the middle and suck on it ! we just do n't add up to dry shit .
i 'm sure luke was n't on that thing when it blew .
okay ... i just need to find a few private message boards ...
kind of . i mean , john 's like this kind of ... craftsman . like he 's a carpenter , and he makes really good tables . but that 's all he can make , and i do n't need anymore tables .
you know , there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we 're losing daylight . quarks and dark matter , things like that . even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast , you know ?
you 've broken all the laws of man , luthor . and now you 've broken the laws of nature ! . . . i assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles i hurled into the sun !
do you know what his budget was ?
`` and so the professor lifted colombe 's skirt high , above her waist . 'let me be your tutor , ' said he , 'in the ways of love . ' with that , he slid her pantalettes down , down , down over her knees , and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip , as slick as an eel -- ''
why not ?
really ?
if this is their ship 's data banks , where is the crew ? or is their entire ship automated ?
her beauty fucks with your mind .
no , i 'm the king of the world .
well , things are a little disorganized around here .
yes , i 'd ... i-i-i 'd love , i 'd love to get you this .
but it 's a delay ! how long ? a day ? two days ? !
do n't worry about horace -- he 'll take orders . come on --
i 'm sorry , darling , have you seen my coffee mug ... ?
you really are pathetic , you know that ? mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet . he is nothing compared to me .
no .
what past ? she has never once , not once , ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago .
let 's not make it a habit .
yes . it did n't matter much to them as long as i disappeared .

ross . real pleased to meet you . i 'm erin .

wow . laurence harvey . he knew frank sinatra ? i knew frank .
a little , i think ... darlin ' ?
it 's not some fairytale in an old book . michael - look at me . i did n't choose this , michael . this is who i am . i love you .
i do n't believe it ...
drop 'em ! drop , drop , drop ! ! !
we can not go through there ... .
black dan'l ?
he 's just exhausted .
i know , but that 's enough .
which is it ? you got ta keep your focus straight .
colson does n't know about it ; he 's pure as a virgin on this one . it 's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for . they were heading to mcgovern 's office later that night .
i will not turn ... and you 'll be forced to kill me .
like you do n't know .
is there much more of this torture ?
mom , i mean dad ...
you 've been going round-the-clock ?
oh . then who 's this one ?
education ?
really biff ? the keenest ?
yeah . my own blood ? and they sell me out for a lousy bet ? i had it in me to hit the top and ? boy , if i wanted to , the things i could tell you about them guys ?
listen , it 's not erasing .
yeah , that 's it . say it slow .
sergeant !
tell him i had to leave suddenly . i got a job in china - some place .
and your name ?

johnny ! uh , you , uh ... should call first , you know ? hey , where the hell were you all day ? you got ta at least call in or something . you okay ?
where do we go from here ?
a snake !
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
the quest 's at an end and where 's the good of it ? a faerie festival over a pile of bones ?
i love that you said that . it makes me feel a bit lighter . i 've been rather heavy lately . thinking about my childhood . realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing . i 've been seeing someone . a therapist .
i do n't even have it on me , so forget it .
now , making a woman cum ... therein lies a challenge .
i want him . i want him so much . i 'll kill myself if i ca n't have him .
should i wake her ?
jackie - what are you talking about ?
this is barry .
you can use my car .
but
i hate this job .
let 's go . pull 'em out .
true ... but it wo n't come easy or free . if ye want to ask , ask jenny greenteeth .
good question . see , that 's where the fun comes in . arcade changes it every time . he 's a machine without a soul . once you give him a soul , he stops being a threat .
you could leave him .
what you have to understand , francie , is that she ... well ... she wanted so much for herself too , and for me , and she never really got to ... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers ... but she could have been ... if times were different she could have been a politician or ... i do n't know .
i never thought to ask . how can you ever forgive me ?
have i said that ?
i 'm with you kid .
you sure ?
okay . then what ?
they were stained .
you are personally responsible . if i can get conjugal rights , will you visit me at sing sing ?
you do n't like my costume ? cool . i 'll go with plan b. which one you like better ?
you 're mad because i shot your girlfriend 's dog .

i told you you ca n't help . this is n't a normal nightmare . i 'm doomed .
then it 's war !
who ?
what 's funny about that ? if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you . the world is full of larry mitchells .
what did you say your name was , sweetheart ?
just after leland street .
do n't move now -- would n't want to hurt this neck -- well , the other afternoon i was on my way home , and there you were , leaving the lodge , and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming .
ugh .
look here . if i ever did eat some pussy - i would never eat any pussy - but , if i did eat some pussy , i sure as hell would n't tell no goddamn body . i 'd be ashamed as a motherfucker .
you did n't care about my case ?
who are you ?
`` production for use only . '' well , maybe that 's the answer .
you love him ?
i ai n't john henry .
you do n't trust me ?
maybe you should n't stand in the road like that . you 're pretty drunk .
enticements a power , wealth , settera .
what about ?
you are an insane person .
i had a baby .
did you ... did you ... ?
what ?
you embarrassed me in front of the highest梤anking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?
you are a catholic ? ?
shut up ! it 's me .
`` over -- '' you know - i can maybe understand , since i been gone , you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime , and for that i can partly blame myself . but what is baffling to me , is how , since i been gone , you 've become a complete and total moron --
thank you .

for your information , frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them . that was his job .

i 'm one of the few who know every inch it , now that john is gone .
he was murdered .
you 're not a kid anymore .
hyah !

jesus .

watch your feet !
i 've been dodging bullets since i was fourteen . no one can kill me . i 'm fucking blessed . i 'm fucking catholic .
so what 's the argument ?
nah , nah , nah , nah .
he 's a hell of a flyer . in fact , he 's so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself . except for one thing . he just ca n't seem to follow orders !
you 're a witness , doc !

johnny , why wo n't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
so , why 'd you want to see me ?
sir .

jesus , george , fifteen percent . that 's an extra two-hundred large .
they did n't have a leg to stand on . there 's no case against me . it 's a clumsy thing to have happen , but nothing to worry about .

i would n't be depressed about it , bern . a guy do n't have to be heroic to be a human being .
you stand still too long in new york you get hit by a bicycle messenger . you know , sometimes , i get the feeling , mr. booker , that you 're laughing at me . why is that ?

the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization .
yes .
slow down , homer -- do n't be in such a big hurry .
it 's murder , and i wo n't be any part of it .
okay , okay , just do n't everyone talk at once ... first of all , little jason has a learning disability ...
my ex-boyfriend was about his height , but he was much bulkier . he could bench two-fifty , three hundred easy .
you like it ? take a look .
no . well , maybe a few things . but mostly just different ...
well , truth is for suckers , is n't it ? .
no !
and you were with cougar . he was my roommate in flight school .
michael ! get behind the wheel .

you 're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face .
greatest .
sure -- because he could always go pirating .
nick !
so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me , and so prevents me from being a good christian ?
i want someone to talk to ...
of course . he 's a `` de-gene-erate '' . he works at gattaca . why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom ? nobody stops to take a leak during a murder .
i have a funny feeling . do you think we 'll get over all that 's happened ?
roy ? your clock broke .
what are you doing here ?
good .
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane .
i did n't mean to ...
i do n't know . santa claus . i had my son 's picture in it . gabe 's picture . it 's the only one i had .
so ?
because you , too , must know .

no ! fool , that i am ! i should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off , as long as ...
we 've found it at every event site we 've been to lately .
i ca n't know things if you do n't tell me .
apparently my opinion was n't needed .
i know you left him a message . what did you say !
he must like shelly , i never saw him hit anyone in his life .
dana , are you listening to me ?
so what 's going on ? who 's lou again ?
like me .
and as i said , sir , we ca n't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich .
va-yomer ... and he said . it goes the other way .
this place do n't seem real popular with the brothers .
the moon is up , my night to howl . will you be okay ?
jeremy phoned this morning
that 's just it . i did n't think . i just did it .
for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet ... but the time has come for us to live as equals .
we 've driven a long way . where is this place ?
i can go . you do n't have to . you do n't never go .
you do n't ravage the countryside , devouring maidens and burning the crops ?
terry ... terry ... .
your place ?
you know my name ?
i really ... i should get back .
well ... it seems we 're truly sailing into the unknown . keep at it . anything you can give me would be appreciated . dismissed .
none , it 's mine - you said it earlier , i 'm nuts .
it 's too much machine for you .
there 's no doubt about it . he 's got his father 's looks . the kid is ugly -- extremely ugly . and smelly . you stink ! it 's just horrible . you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled . what 's his name ?
go ahead .
i have heard of them .
townsend , he had some of father 's books .
where you going ?
you 've suckered me before , darling , remember ? why should i believe you now ?
keep stallin ' .
a normal person .
what is that ?
that 's hard to believe .
-- way we could safely --
tailored specifically to each participant . think of it as a great vacation , except you do n't go to it , it comes to you .
assume there is something to hid . i go to a lot of trouble . what do i do ? what would you do ?
you were right , ellie . you were right all along .
friend of yours ?
what 's up ?
goddamn !
you 're not going to like this . please try to smile ...
y-yes .
seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted , doctor sandler says you 'll be out in a week . is n't that wonderful ?
maybe not to your face ...
you having fun ?
i think , everybody gets their own white horse , and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day , and everybody 's best friends with everybody else , when you play sports , there 's no teams , so nobody gets picked last .
leon ? no . i抦 afraid he left .
we figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . after that , there 's not much hope . we want a rescue operation mounted tonight . that does n't give you much time .
um , okay . i 'll call my study partner .
he 's been dead for three months .
'yes ' .
you know nothing about feelings , natural or unnatural .
you do n't give up , do you ?
not if you go .
dave , it 's going to be okay . just talk to us on the record and we 'll protect you . i guarantee it .
but i never said rudy .
sir , if you do n't mind my saying , i do n't understand your history at all . i mean , why would you want to win the war ? you 're not after glory , like benedict ... you 're a slave owner , and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army .
that 's better . got the radar ready ?
am i right , did sam sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking suzie ? that 's murder , kelly .
i am not a virgin , doctor . i was married for twenty three years , two daughters . i even have grandchildren ... surprised ? it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother . my children wo n't even see me any more , that 's their revenge . i think they tell their friends that i 've passed on . and do n't tell me i 'm making up for past mistakes doctor freud .
how much is a person supposed to stand ?
we are living in cloudcuckooland -- we 'll never get this done today .

fuckin ' guy 's been shooting slants , albert ! i mean , what do you think ?
shhh !
follow him where ?
that guy who got shot --
there was no other way .
how come all these new names are pasted into the plat book ?
it 's from both of us . of course you 'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
if it has to be -- do you mind if i do it myself ? oh , i do n't mean with the gun . this is no trick . when i wrote that note you have in your pocket -- that was no trick either . it 's not so hard for me as you think . i 'm not crying about it , i 've been skating close to it for quite some time . the water is cold down there -- but so is everything else . and there 's you .
he 'll wear a wire ?
you 'll love it .

sure ... lots of guys at the track talk like that ... but how do you know you 'll have any dough next month ... what 's this ? i gave you two hundred .
no , i 'm not ...
mrs. otto , there is no such thing as an accident . the word does n't mean anything to me . as far as i 'm concerned , somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner . some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement . they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference . that 's what 's done , mrs. otto . i 've seen it happen so many times before .
cut to the fucking chase , flynne .

well , what marty you think is gon na be here in this house with a girl ?
the senator called -- apologized for not coming personally , but said you 'd understand . also , some of the judges ... they 've all sent gifts . and another call from virgil sollozzo .

did you see a girl come by here ?
when i finally get kissed , i 'll know .

we got a problem , that thing we took care of upstate ?
attrition . when you regret your sins , but not because you love god .
i 'm saying the third prevision was n't there . and that 's not all . i spent a few hours down there and it turns out there 's a dozen more cases with missing previsions .
it 's a bloody funny thing . you know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he 's as calm as gentle jesus ... ... then he goes and does a thing like that . it 's a bloody funny thing .
any court in the land would understand . we 'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we 'll go to the police .
you just came back home , daddy . i do n't wan na leave right now -- i wan na stay home and be with you .

you forget -- time travel is instantaneous . the time machine would melt , but you would have already travelled through time . of course , it 's a moot point regardless . the only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the army 's nevada test site , and those tests are kept absolutely top secret .
awful sorry i betrayed you fellas ; must be my hogwallop blood .

we 're looking at all berlin outbound . good news is , every train station in berlin has thirty to forty fixed , digital security cameras . common feed .

naz dravi ! ... ..what do you like about this place , these people , chris ?

the hell with the schedule , you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over . what i want is a vote on it right now !
please ! do n't say those words . well ... as you can see ... many of us are devastated by this news . this is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man . and i have taken it upon myself to spearhead the jim cunningham defence campaign . but unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest ... which involves you .
you 've got a smart man , mrs. stone . hang onto him .
corleone .

maybe . but no one ever advertised before .
her grandmother said she 'd been threatening to run away . and i found the car at the miami bus terminal .

maybe she turned .
you 're sacred of 'em , are n't ya ?
deep , real deep .
you have a problem ?

i came all the way down here same as you did . keep from gettin ' killed . happened to see those jarheads beatin ' on a good collar -- habla ingles , tomas ?
all right .
i would n't dare answer that .
alright , we 're going . we 'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we 'll ride horses on the beach ... right in the surf ... but you have to ride like a cowboy , none of that side-saddle stuff .

i 'm just saying , the man is a problem . and he 's your problem . was n't me idea to bring him along .

oh ?
well , yeah ... ok , but you 're not listening to me . there are other things that need to be taken into account here . like the whole spectrum of human emotion . you 're just lumping everything into these two categories ... and , like , denying everything else .
you think i made that up about the gun ...
let me ask you a question , if i may . how do you think she got the job in the first place ? i do n't mean to burst your bubble , mantan the marvelous , but sloan is an opportunity .

yeah ?
i want to get in .

and patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield . unless we can keep cornwallis in the south until the french arrive . a treaty was signed at versailles after our victory at saratoga . the french are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops .

wow ! that 's neat . can i sit in it ?
well , i heard you met herr mozart .
like what ?
why , yes , actually . death and chance stole your parents . but rather than become a victim , you have done everything in your power to control the fates . for what is batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world , an attempt to control death itself .
mmmm , i love the smell of a woman .
take what you 've got and get out of there .

sometimes ... once they 've been caught they feel a need for disclosure . they have so much they want to tell . but they 've never had a sympathetic ear . they need someone to understand why . stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully . it was part of the ritual . some were n't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean . but these last three ... they were still in water - always in water - but listen , he was n't just careless . it went beyond that ...

you mean we learn the rules ...
i think you 're a nice girl . i like you . but i can read signs if the print is large enough . it was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector . a sort of tenseness , as if you were afraid of something .
senor colon , an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew . i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment .

hit was borned a little too early on . my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other . i reckon they changed their mind about havin ' another'n . i was about six or eight year old then and they did n't care too much for me so i reckon they did n't need somethin ' else to worry 'em with .
donald , an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god . you are an agnostic . an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god ... but does not deny the possibility that god exists .
no , a ...
interesting suit .
tell him you 're afraid of love . afraid of needing .
late renaissance , i think . caravaggio or brunelleschi .
what 's that idiot doing next door ? we use your van . it 's up some stairs this place , so we 'll stick out like balls on a bulldog . plank is going up first . there is a cage but it is never locked , is it plank ?
then we 'll both starve ... an old man like me , who hardly has strength as it is -- me , without whom ... me , your own father ...
it was nobody . ah ... he 's a poll , taker . i 'm thinking of voting democrat this year . but do n't mention it to your father . how was school today ?

you think i 'm like that ?
that 's right .
no fear .
listen here , young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it ?
it does n't matter how much you worked on them . it matters how much you can get for them .
it 's about forty miles from here . i do n't know if you 've looked at a map , it 's close to london but it 's a city in itself . a roman city . it 's a nice house . i 'm having a problem with ants . i uh ... it 's the warmer weather . i ca n't seem to find the nest . sorry , do you understand `` ants '' ?
no , i have n't heard .
kid . do n't waste your time . she 's out of your league .
you planning on going somewhere , eduardo ? you do n't like it here ? this is the best situation you 're going to have for a long , long time .
the feds ? !

i 'm sorry , alright ? it was just a stupid joke .
no , edgar allen .
his name is jared nomak .

it was henry follett .
excuse me , but you look like a couple who are on their way to america .
i will , dear . i promise . why mcdonald 's ?
the ad..
so maybe dr. becker would know . [ beat ] but , as i 'm sure you know , the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities .
very professional of you .
well ... the red bra .
for more than forty years . so madame told me .
i do n't know why i 'm talking to you , you 've got that thing on your head .
yeah , okay .
yes -- only there 's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it 's forcing the body 's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they 're accustomed to . the senator 's body is literally burning itself out . scott -- this machine kills people and i do n't think magneto realizes it .
yeah .
did you ever eat fish heads and rice ?
i 'm impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
i 'll pay you .
tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal . besides , there is no such thing as bad publicity .

that 's her job . you have to respect that .
it 's only you and me . that 's what happens when you go away . we 're on our own . forget everybody . forget paulie . as long as he 's on parole he does n't want anybody doing anything .
what do i got ta do ?
the carter boy . tell me about him .
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates ...
it hurts , it hurts so bad , make it stop .

i haven抰 thought about that in years .
it is dangerous to be here . the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches .
yeah , like ...

you said bribery twice ...
i told you not to - ?
thank you , bloom . i knew i could con you .
jesus , she 's my best friend .
yes walter .

i do n't remember . see , i have no short- * term memory . it 's not amnesia - *
i 'm sorry to be late , natalie .

you got to have fun with it . there 's no point if you 're not having any fun . would you like me to be there tomorrow ?

i 'm sorry , mrs. corleone . we 're not to let you through .
yeah .
but he knows that , sir ... ca n't i stay , sir ?
i 'm going to look around .
you 're not < u > thinking < /u > right , pal ...
you know , i was just thinking , lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in metropolis --
sir , my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity . he has not taken that fifth amendment as it was his right to do , and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing , counsel advised him to do . so , i think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record .
the pleasure is mine , madame .
is he good ?
what is it , madame ?
i 'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people . but life is n't just death harry , do n't ignore the living , especially your daughter .

you used to say that was our strength .
of course ! we must do it ! it 's the will of god ! what is it ?
there , the guy ... how did you do that , without even touching him ? without noise . it 's like you put him away ... how did you do it ?
i do n't recall inviting you .
if she 's telling you the truth .
seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick .
do n't get premature on me , jimmy . we do n't light up 'til the fat lady sings .
you think that section on the point is ridable , lance ?
never mind it ? that 's not my money ! that 's bruce 's money !
here is the church and here is the steeple . we sure are cute for two ugly people . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
... who is this ?
it 's the lights . and the scotch .
go ahead -- you did n't used to be so fussy --
we do n't have to run .
by all means .
so , is he dead or what ?
man i have n't seen her in forever . what the fuck 's she up to ?
you whaaaaaat ? you paid it ? you gave a bondsman ten percent ?
i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland . the bus stopped in los angeles . i had to get off and take a rest . i 'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight . i 'm just too tired to go on .
well , congratulations lydia , because out of several thousand card holders ... in conjunction with several major credit card companies ...

this is the park view hotel . i 'm the hotel manager . are you looking for someone ?
is this what you gave mary ?
leonard , dutton , erlich . they do n't matter . i want the king .
good . so shall we leave it at that then ?
i think .
and the money ?
playhouses are not for well-born ladies .
-et lux perpetua-
did the leads come in yet ?
because we , and our associates , have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you , < u > because < /u > of shyster lawyers like you , and we 'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible .
uhh , miss devoto , these people are already at ease . this is not a beauty parlor , it 's a funeral parlor .
hide your laptop here .

we 're looking for mike .
i was trying to educate you .
well , sam , i might as well tell you the truth . it 's this lawsuit you 've gotten yourself all involved with . i want you to drop the damned thing .

does he do this all the time ?
kelly --
hello , anna ahm ... scott -- have some wine .
if you 're lucky . then again , it depends on what you call living .
it 's a technique i read about . if you smoke 60 a day , you buy three packs , throw one cigar- ette away , and smoke 59. day 2 , you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
buff , buff , buff , buff , buff .
oh ... well , maybe we better synchronize our spells ... or stagger them .
my pleasure , jody

[ that he used policemen . that you killed them , it made it a police matter . the ramos family could n't refuse our involvement . ]
i can get you front and center . what do you like ? i can get you mets , knicks , rangers ? hell , i can get you the mayor 's box .
it 's not a rumor . it 's a sale . if tisch can unload cbs for $ 81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from brown & williamson , that could screw up the sale , could it not ?
you 're not going to fail me are you ?
you 've been hurt .
well , i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook 's chicken used to be called coon 's chicken , and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism ... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture ...
where are your folks ?
oooh .
when you find the guy , you 'll know .
farm boy . polish my horse 's saddle . i want to see my face shining in it by morning .

you look very pretty .
sir ?

benjamin ? i 'm going to ask you something but you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want .
right with you .
i used to be like them , neil . i know what they 're going through .
what did he say ?
well . if you say so .
not this .
they are all tutsi cockroaches .
y'know , annie , i been thinking if it works for one game , maybe it 'll work for a whole buncha games .
you 're terry malloy , are n't you ?
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you .
and if i ever catch you coming near my man again ...
it 's ... a leap of faith . oh , god .
and do n't ever get down on your knees again , understand ?
you did fuck him , did n't you ?
you forget what i went through to give ya the best .
rach .
after those cops , you 'll never be able to come back to cleveland .

you go ahead and relax . i 'll cook .
do n't start on me today .
six months ago , a police lieutenant named charles fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note , you may have heard of it ...
what is that ? a pencil that writes in ink ?
yes , hannah ?
you know i 'm right .
but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking ... believe me , anna , words never help at all . they only serve to confuse . i love you , anna . is n't i that enough ?
yeah , for the last time , i hope . i 'm done with this freak show . i 'm moving back to the real world .
what ? what ?
sure . thanks .
going to tell ellie ?
maybe there 's a better idea ... what about birds ... get a lift from some friendly bird ...
oh my god , it 's a preparation room .
well , you see billy , it do n't really matter right now if it 's 2 kilos or 200 kilos . the turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they 're fighting the drug trade .
good christ ! ca n't you lose these jokers ?
i like it well done .
it 's a house .
who are you ?
i 'll see you at mass tomorrow . we 'll sit down and we 'll discuss the whole thing .
hey , i heard all about it -- the parents , the grandparents , the china town thing -- and i believe you , okay ? that 's why we 're here . now go get dressed .
yeah ?
yes .
let 's go you two . we 're headed for the mountains .
how many gays do you know ?
two .
what are you talking about ? what difference -- ?
all right . i do n't have to hear any more . i think i understand what happened . i understand it was your brother 's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding . i 'm not sayin ' salvy should n't have acted the way he did . but , joey , you do n't raise your hands . you do n't do that kind of thing . this time we forget about it but no more after this . you understand ?
why ?
and i do n't like what we 've become . i 'll cover any losses you have on this one . now get out , you asshole !
no name ? that 's ok. i 'll just call you big pink .
you know of it ?
you leave me high and dry ... you come back looking like a zombie ... .
well , i do n't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor . unless you 're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside . it takes a while to get used to .
oh , american , thank you . i like them .
oh no !
there 's other things to be learned .
do me a favor , will you , george ?
i 'm lucky i found it . someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage .
no prisoners . do n't worry , frank , just a little psychological first aid .
we 're always in here . she really gets him , does n't she ?
no ! never !
andy , do you realize you do n't do comedy anymore ? where 's that sweet guy who used to do `` here i come to save the day ! '' ? please , enough with the wrestling ! you 've lost touch with reality !
the humpback was indigenous to earth . earth of the past .
those idiot broads ! here we are all packed to go to miami , and what happens ? the saxophone runs off with a bible salesman , and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant . i ought to fire you , bienstock .
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard .
then i 'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights .
so you 're saying that ulysses -- everything he said to his queen when he came back -- everything was a lie ? he just wanted to fuck around ?
i do n't see what else you can do , charles . if he 's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
the same as the first time ...
it 's incredible who 's here .
used record shop down on turk street . i was in there looking for some robert johnson . memories ... memory lane or something ...
what 's that little 'droid ' carrying that 's so blasted important ?
that 's right -- it 's like ticklin ' a alligator 's belly .
kramer ... there 's something i ought to tell you .
take them , you never know ... if you want to have some fun . take , it 's a gift .
right .
did you kill all those guards ?
what ?
who would 've thought he was capable of such atrocities ? !
like turning off a light .
no . i did n't run away . i went out of town .
you mean you 've known about him all along ? why did n't you tell me ?
do n't look so disappointed . it should be hairy enough ... even for you .
a man , here , can make a run straight through to webb .
casharoonie !
so then what , mr. wandering jack ?
just some fatherly advice .
do < u > not < /u > return scan , mr. spock ! it may be misinterpreted as hostility !
sure did . i 'll tell you , if that man was any better looking it 'd be a crime 'a some sort ...
who did you call ?
what the hell do i do now ?
they 'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home .
santos ... you kill that sailor , otherwise he 's gon na turn my baby against me .
neil , i know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you 're feeling . you have to let him see who you are- it 's your only chance .
please calm yourself . you 'll soon be well if you do .
oh , pony 's band `` dream girls '' ? been on the road opening for `` midnight hore '' . stadiums , man . wait , so pony 's coming by here ?
ma'am .
where 'd you find such creeps ?
what ... ?
you 're so pale ... i hope you 're not coming down with something .
she is very hot .
give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called teddy .
oh , it 's stupid , is n't it .
there are one or two which should complement the night 's entertainment , master
i do n't think so , but it do n't really matter . they know i 'm meeting you .
... my books used to be perfect . anyone could open them up , make sense of the whole goddamn store .
it will take less effort as you learn .
sure , why not . you did save my life , mr . rielly .
you 'd look naked without one .
throw it . c'mon , right in the chest .
we failed to mention the mower guy 's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house , so he ca n't say how long she was in there . same with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that 's it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his .
no . why should it ?
well that 's for me to know - but i did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big .
you think they 're going to catch ... where are you going ?
when did you get in ?
yes , sir .
what `` all females '' ? if i 'm the only --
you 're a good officer , major mandrake . you have a right to know . it looks like we 're in a shooting war !
listen to me , mrs otto . listen very carefully . i do know what 's best .

i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too , eh ?
i 'm a solid man .

mm-hm . i do n't know if i got a good voice or not but ... practice is only on mondays and wednesdays , so ...
would you be willing to have dinner with me ?
this doctor , was he tall , with dark hair ?
so we 're waitin ' to hit this warrant - we got emergency service with the heavy weapons standin ' by - ready to go . i say , lem me get a cigar outta the car . i go to get the cigar and boom ! all the sudden i turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go . right where i was standin ' . that coulda been it . i coulda had my head blown off and for what ? some stupid kid got panicky , takes the safety off and it 's over . if i had n't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - i would 've had my head blown off .
rick , i 'm concerned .
i 'm your worst fuckin ' nightmare . now , if you do n't want me to keep on hurting you , it 's important that i believe you and right now i do n't . so tell me , where did they go ?

what good will they do ?
put your tiny little mind at ease .
did she ask about me ?
you 're right .
what disease ?
sure .
you driving her ?
i 'm not sure ... i mean ... i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking ?
the problem is i ca n't hear myself sing with all this ... ... music . you know what i 'm saying ?
there were two . not one . but two .
no , george , do n't . . .
yeah , me too .
nothin . quit lookin ' at me like that !

it 's all set . my guy in miami said he 'd have them within the next few weeks . are you sure you do n't want to go in with me ? five thousand dollars outlay , a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return . a consortium of court street lawyers and judges . they 're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine cuban cigars .
i wonder if i hang around with you because you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something . like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly .
i 'm looking for charley . i heard charley was waiting for me . charley ?
little light reading matter . just right for his age .

i wonder - you put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell ?
oh , my god .
i drive around .
beats me . city officials . secret service . dallas police . they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before . but they did n't bother running through dealey . they stopped right there , said something like , `` and afterwards there 's only the freeway , '' and went home .
how are you feeling ?
`` went away . '' i like that .
yes . without question .
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma . but you 've been unconscious since they brought you in .

i 'm not interested in blind dates .
you want betty grable !
what if you 're wrong ? no -- i 'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you ca n't deny the possibility -- and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly ... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks .

do what ?
ring out the old year , ring in the new . ring-a-ding-ding .
truthfully ? there has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then , as you so wisely told me , i 'd never built in africa .
turn her over to a stalker .
no .
you 're sorry . christ , eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit ...

it 's not `` war . '' it is a < u > pageant < /u > . it 's a < u > pageant < /u > ... like the oscars ... why we came to < u > you < /u > ...
we have to avoid injuring it . what we really need is some electric animal prods .
what 's what ? oh , that . just a little going away present .
shit .
that 's the farren house .

you remember that boy who lost his mind , joe ? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark . he would n't miss a one . make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe . he would pick up a brick and say `` go on in there brick and hit somebody '' and it would find its mark .
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
found what ?
no .
that 'll put fire in my soldiers !
leave me alone , dammit ! you people are crazy ! i 've got to get away from here ! i 've got to do something !
well done , mozart . really quite fine .
you 're talking about real excitement ?
they come when you sleep .
i care only about michelle . should i ask her when we first arrive ? or ... or when we 're leaving ? i could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace . i get so confused ...
numero trois , steak . monsieur , mesdames , bon appetit .
a shark attacked thea and some kids ... she 's going after it ... .

i 'm sorry . i just wanted to say that . this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
you 're lucky , flynne .
i 'll be asking the questions . last night , you hear anything unusual ? screams ? shouts ?
he should have armed himself if he was gon na decorate his saloon with the body of my friend .

you 'll keep your trap shut , all right .
you did n't visit him in prison .

i am . you-you made my day .
that i am not rheya . that rheya died . killed herself . i 'm different .
i 'm not in the mood for dining and dancing .
someone else was there .
any sign of data , or the borg themselves ?
jorge , don jaime 's son , at your service .
just a little strategy session . but in person this time .
emphatically not , sir . the prospect terrifies me . now , do n't misunderstand me , sir , i do n't resent your not paying me for the past two months , but the thought that i should split my bank account with you ... that you should take half of my life 's savings ... that is really too much for me .
get out .
you think you 're doing me a big favor by staying ?
childs , where 's that magneto from chopper one ?
then say it ... just say it to me ... !
yeah , i 'm sure .
i 'm not talking just physically . even your anger is perfect .
really , sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists ?
and hungry , i 'd say . you had such a long journey .
i think whoever sent the message did it because they 're worried about us .
zerelda ? little zee mimms ?
oh , uh , yeah , we were , but , uh , sooze , screwed up the tickets .
stop it .
there 's a dog in the road .
is that what she used to sing ?
what is it , choco ?
oh yeah . take a look .
just a few ... just a day or two ... the weekend .
it 's probably just a strained muscle .
i mean , i 've looked everywhere .
it 's my own design . you wo n't find another table like it in the world .
i 'll give you anything you want . anything ! please !
fine , i guess ...
who ?
jeanne , you are not helping yourself . if you do n't answer our questions properly , your refusal will be taken into account .
there 's something different about the sound of her voice ... and what did she mean last night , she has n't slept with him yet . yet . what does `` yet '' mean , anyway ? `` i have n't seen ... evil dead ii yet . '' what does that mean ? it means you 're going to go , does n't it ?
that 's what gordon 's always saying .
of course . so sexy .
where it can do the most damage .
where 's he at ?
we 'll see who 's dreamin ' , m'man .
you ok ?
i think he got a little scratch , mother .
good lord !
the same . he 's apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command .
... yes ?
get out of here ... .
what do you think he 's doing ?
what are your plans in new york ?
you do n't expect us to believe that do you ?
even cosier .
'scuse me , partner , but that 's a ghetto knock .
coffee ?
boca ?
when was that ?
yeah , well , at least fish do n't use your razor or pee on the seat ...
we need another one .
oh , i should n't have ...
hit by a swinging door ? or maybe a yellow cab ?
man , monster ... just ... just do n't start trying to hit me ...
she knows who killed del . elden , she said it was a woman .
that sounds charming . what are you planning to do tomorrow ?
but perhaps , there is some , some less radical solution .
you go to hell . you go straight to hell , mrs. robinson . do you think i 'm proud of myself ? do you think i 'm proud of this ?
excellent . then , you are excused till morning .
and what is that ?
these appointments were not my idea , remember .
va jouer , mon ange .
yeah . i got an idea . come on , let 's get to a telephone .
then why in hell 're you doin ' this ? you ought to be in bed .
no you were n't .
if they 're not at the light , look for them . i do n't want them out there . get them back to port !
different .
i guess part of us never really leaves high school .
i know . least you did n't shoot all of them .
i gave them me . said some nice things about me , rudy . i appreciate it . but do n't worry . i do love her . and she loves me . you had that right all along .
six weeks .
it looks wonderful . it is wonderful , let 's face it .
yeah , that works out .
gee , you 're home early !
do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? do n't tell anyone what you just told me .
i have cheerleading squad .
okay , dad .
oh , nothing . he is crazy , that 's all . i had a little trouble with him .
we used to .
say ... `` equus '' ? it 's got everything .
what the fuck kind of questions are those ?
well , bomb , we have about sixty seconds to drop . just wondering if everything is all right . have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding ?
no , your marriage bed .
i do n't know . not a war exactly . it 's more a ... a misapprehension maybe ...
... when you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or two ? do something they did n't know they were capable of ?
agnes , i do n't believe you know nothing about sex ...
why do n't you go in and sit down . i have some gifts for you .
i 'm not a commander , there is no national space exploration administration . there is no snip .
janet .
mother , is that you ?
then let him talks to me . we do n't need you to solve our prob ...
well , sheronda , it was nice talking to you .
oh hi , what can i do for you ?
so , how do i fit into this scheme ?
it 's all better left unsaid , grace .
this is a complicated case , your honor ...
yeah , four years ago . they had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people . i 'm not playing , there was about a thousand goats running around , and it gets dark at four o'clock . then the whack club i 'm on loses three games in a row and i get blamed . so they fire me .
and like every hamburger guy knows , when you get your one big chance at the good life , you abuse every second of it until they figure out you do n't belong there and kick your sorry ass out .
... < u > is n't < /u > it ? hey , what-the-hey ... it 's all part of the bittersweet ...
it 's not ?
she loves me the way no woman ever has .
yep .
go to millie 's hair salon in spitalfields . take her to the metro for a margarita . do n't have to tell her who you are . just tell her jody was thinking --
okay , pete .
running away is no solution .
you need anything ?
mmmmh ... i love you , too , will . good night .
yes , great ! it 's a beautiful house .
just wanted to say good game .
presence - with a double ass meaning gifts i bestow , with my riff , and my flow but you do n't hear me though think fast , catch me , yo cause i throw what i know with a resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf jackass crackas , bodystackas dicktootin niggas , masturbatin ' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
thank you .
i told her thank you very much , but it was inconvenient because ... uh ... because ...
i do n't know ... every once in a while i just get the feeling something awful 's going to happen .
no .
i swear .
goodnight vada .
well , maybe he did , huh ?
... i 'm at least half a bum . yeah , fightin ' is a crazy racket . the roughest part is the mornin ' after .

i will be back in a few days .
i have no idea ...

so you still have n't said , how you wan na do it ?
i have to talk to evelyn . and i want you to meet her .
there 's a better place for us to eat .
look -- yes . i mean thanks , but -- do n't you think we better be realistic ?
seven of clubs . nobody 's mad we just want to talk about it .
yeah , see you in hell .
yeah , unhappy and fat . and i still find the meetings very comforting , you know .
okay .
what was it then ?
you too , gerry .
jesus . how much ... how much will the whole thing cost ?
what about it ?
your hole is healed , then ?
and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson ?
let 'em eat their hearts out .
i 'm a mirror .
come over tomorrow and read it to me ?
we 've broken out , oh , the blessed freedom of it all ! eh , have you got a nail file , these handcuffs are killing me . i was framed . i was innocent .
i do n't believe it .
maybe he 'll get a little nervous , but who gives a shit ?
i 'm hardly doing a thing . the less i think of it the better . my parents are arranging everything . the gous are a very powerful family . my marrying one will be good for my father 's career .
you have to go .
not a class , not a thing , just picked stuff up by myself .
they 're carrying guns in town .
you did miss --
does n't look like much . how come those commos want it so bad ?
no .
well , we had talked ...
that was something i was never able to find out , sir .
but why ? just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are ? !
what answers ?
i just saw joe . he 's here .
however our ideas disagree , as i 've said before , i 'm < u > not < /u > a coward ! and it happens you 've got no choice : either < u > i < /u > take you down there , in the lungfish , or you do n't get there -
try 'flintstone . '
please do n't kill us , please do n't kill us .
do n't think it 's even an issue .
here . i played gregory lutz .
why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside ?
ready ?
out . it 's the way out . so just keep it in your minds if ya ever wan na make use of it .
how long has he been in there , son ?
no ! you mean right at the end ? alfredo that 's right , toto , right at the end ? and do n't ask me what it means . if you figure it out , let me know ...
that 's it . no . no way .
get out ...
upstairs . getting cleaned up .
throwers do n't worry about ticking . modern bombs do n't tick .
surprise ?
that 's why they have state borders ... why n't you get a replacement ?
arlo , nobody 's gon na believe us .
that 's right -- premature ejection .
like you 're from n'yawk .
good girl .
nobody cares about me at home . they would n't even miss me .
i ... um ...
you are still so very young .
well , what 're you going to do ?
are you all right ?
... -son .
oh , it 's only a machine , harold . it 's not as if it were < u > alive < /u > , like a horse or a camel . we may live in a machine age , but i simply ca n't treat them as equals . of course , the age has its advantages .
you 're telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot ?
listen , son , you know as well as me this kind of hitmen : they come from nowhere , get the contract and disappear . they 're lonely , worse than wolves .
it might give us something .
i know what mommy says . i 'm in charge today , though .
it 's strip reality , actually , like what the pilots always want to play .
so whenever we want ...
augh ?
sir , i have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
is that your `` expert opinion ? '' the only answer we 've had out of you is `` i do n't know . ''
your dad ? !
well , you 're gon na start , if you hope to live through this . a square job and a quiet life . you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo 's boys will be all over you .
incidentally -- i do n't mean to embarrass you in any way , but i 'm a rather brilliant surgeon . perhaps i can help you with that hump .
oh my god ... hello .
you sure talk like a girl who 's been married .
listen . understand . that terminator is out there . it ca n't be reasoned with , it ca n't be bargained with ... it does n't feel pity of remorse or fear ... and it absolutely will not stop . ever . until you are dead .
but ... if we were able to separate china from russia once and for all , we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century .

keller , black lion squadron . i knew him at pensacola . he 's damn good .
real rain ?
he was a present . besides , we 're moving anyway . you said .
then why the hell are you sitting around here ?
which one would you like to join , luthor ? pick a hole .
well ... it 's obviously intentional ... some kind of attempt at communication ... maybe it 's a symbol that means something to them ...
which part ? the colonel 's ? or yours ?
the american said intervention is too costly , better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command .
what do you expect when you talk like that ?
fight fire with fire . threaten to go to her husband .
to apologize .
stop him , alex . you 've got to stop him .
i 'm sorry .
apollo 's a great fighter .

he 's the -- he looks like ichabod crane ?
what 's that for ?
bulk ... why do n't we give mr. peep here a chance to think it over ?
no . i draw the line .
did you confess ?
east coast people are different .
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to ? what is it , bob ? !
that 's one way to put it .
nobody sees where i get the stuff . that 's good business . i 'll be back in thirty minutes .

you 're acting like a child .
my son ... my mind ...

did you say rape her ?
of course you 'll give me the blame again . like back then . just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - is n't that right , ellen ?
you 're only allowed to shoot at germans , that 's one of the rules .
that 's a scientific impossibility , you know . heisenberg uncertainty principle . whatever you study , you also change .

i sure wish superman was around . he would n't let any of this go on . not for one minute .
no - she is n't in any trouble is she ?
`` tortious interference '' ? sounds like a disease caught by a radio .
coming , eileen ...
wiggle your toes .
it ca n't be .
the troupe , the scenery , everything -- all on board , waiting . you have a rehearsal in vienna tomorrow morning . come , madam , are you mad ?
now , you listen to me . you ai n't gon na do a goddamn fucking thing , you hear me ! nobody cares what you think , i 'm running this show , i make the decisions .
you guys are not under oath , here . i am assuming you knew these two guys from before , huh ?
you call them ...
so what do you say we shut off that light and get close , huh ?
according to the backer 's list you raised $ 60,000 . but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . there 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .
unless daddy comes back later .
is it true you 're going to interview dr. furtw鋘gler today ?
the minute i saw you . i said to myself , she 's a weaver . have you ever used a loom ?
i am ... except i 've got ta do somebody at their house .
he died .
deb ... it 's me . i need you to step out front .
i like that girl . that quality of quiet graciousness ...
how can you tell ?
too late ? that 's for me to say .
get that outta your mouth !
do i have to talk to those two ?
let 's go .
you comin ' ?
every time the media get a look at him , they come to me . i 'm running out of lies , trevor .
i think that 's a pretty reasonable request .
okay , i got ta tell you . i 've discovered some things . anyway i have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them . the first picture is this .
it 's a simple question . have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband ?
hey , hey , hey . j. edgar would 've loved you . he 'd love anybody who joined the bureau to , what was it ? `` to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests '' ?
money is money ... .
he 's seen both of us now .
i do n't have time for all this shit ! just handle it , bob ! keep it out of the white house . what else ? kissinger 's waiting -- he 's gon na throw a tantrum again if i do n't see him , threatening to quit ... again .
i did n't ask for this .
you said nazi low-riders ... ?
why ?
we got a saying here . a-low-ha !
are you sure you saw something ?
i 'm president of the international fletch corporation .
yeah , i 'm here . i just do n't like the anonymous crap . it means your either chickenshit or not for real .
or are you too scared ?
a future . the only future i 've got .
remember when you told me that lisa rosenberg liked me ?
welcome to the human race . do you know , there are people who admire you ? reasonable people . why do n't you < u > find < /u > them ... ?
would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them ?
no .
promise me that we 'll never be like them . i do n't want to wind up like that .
well , it is . just because i 'm happy does n't mean i 'm on vacation . you 're just not used to seein ' me happy , 'cause it 's been about fifteen fuckin ' years since i been happy . but my shit is forever together .
four aces , doc .
oh -- you would !
sorry . what you doing ?
in another hour , i 'll be king of the forest . long live the king ! if ... .
i told you -- i quit .
i saw mr. faber . you remember mr. faber , do n't you ?
yeah . i 'm not saying you should get a tattoo . but you should make yourself happy .
did you ever take a good look at her -- uh --
and you know what i thought then , kate ? i thought , i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much . i still hope that .
i'm-i 'm always happy to help you financially . i think i 've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men . there 's nothing i would --
up down . down up . it 's the same . you see things through both eyes .
they 're just . . . floating around out there . the computer knows where .
i mess around with this stuff , but i never thought anything would happen .
fucking a .
we decided ...
satch is busting me for sissy clark 's murder . john ...
how much longer ?
and what 's that ?
it 's a lead mine .
crashes into a jeep and totals his neck . that 's carl ...
well if that 's what it takes for us two to get warm , i 'd rather not , if it 's all the same .
it looks like a tablecloth .
you 're talking about complicity .
invitations ?
the renting agent and the tailor .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
you are home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , i 'll be your point person here on the magazine .
doctor , i hate to break this to you , but my mother is a little batty .
i gon na meet that family of yours ?
... and you had to kill him ?
oh , space ! -- you said the right thing .
i did n't say that . that 's up to you . i think that if you do , if you choose to come back , you 'll be a better pilot ... a better man .
you 're a good writer , nick . i give this writing an a-plus .
we 're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can .
including you ?
you could also try a bamboo pole and a worm .
she tryin ' to work your ass against me , ai n't she ?
< u > no < /u > ! you might think they 're godly , you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin ' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and --
they do n't know this .
big case ?
just a little appetizer . i want our porker to know we 're serving . i want to put some iron into that big yap ...
it 's the so-called `` normal '' guys who always let you down . sickos never scare me . at least they 're commited .
i feel like a bootlegger 's wife . look !
but if we take their money and supplies ...
excuse me , but this island did n't have a murder rate until you people showed up . i 've never seen a dead body before .
alright , good , that 's good . i like this fellow , like him very much .
do you think everything 's going to turn to ice ?
i was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder , but her memory of it is gone , at least for the time being . i also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight . any idea who chloe or lonnie are ?
do n't you remember , animal ? a chicken lays those things .
she 's not my secretary . she 's what they call an executive liaison , and i 'm not banging her , if that 's what you抮e implying .
where do you get your ideas ?
there 's hundreds of them . this must be a record of the children who died at the mills , like luke said .
that does n't mean shit . where do you come from , huh ? and i do n't mean indiana .
i know so , major . i know so . and add to that , the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they 've got .
oh .
you must have known it would happen . you could n't have been entirely unprepared . like you said , i 've been living with the guy . we were bound to get around to it sometime .
it 'll be wonderful . we 'll be at peace . in the afterlife , you do n't have to worry about finding work .
no , my dear . you must be mistaken .
now i did n't say that either ... naturally nothing would please me more .
if he comes near you again , i 'll break his neck --
i am sleepy .
i do n't know ... my computer ...
桰 was gon na feed 'em , terry .
sure , a little disorientation . that 's normal , when they transport you . it 'll come back to you . you 're doing real well in training . remarkable , really ...
this date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious ?
thanks .
absolutely .
what is it rita ?
what about the intro ?
i 'm sorry about that . really . but --
negative . the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced .
dell , what 's the last thing you can remember ?
oh yes , pixilated .
our < u > mission < /u > ! goddam it , spock , you 're talking about the end of every life on earth ! you 're half human , have n't you got any goddamned feelings about < u > that < /u > ! !
i would n't give up your day job .
your hair looks so cute like that .
he 's going to wish he was dead .
i 'll wait .
at the wedding ? you invite him ? bob , do n't you realize he 's writing another article about me ?

his physics are a little different than ours . do n't worry
i hope so . hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero .
fair enough . you break your word , i 'll kill all of you . kate , honey !
you should n't use my name .
i ca n't !
yes !
shut up , ike .
wow !
black . labrador .
actually , he only asked me one ridiculous question . the rest were n't so bad .
and she 's such a good-hearted thing , there is n't an ounce of harm or malice in her .
oh , you 're not so badly off . there 's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife .
mikey --
what 's happening to me ? why am i getting so much weaker ?
thousands .
please .
ahhhhhh !
that 's right i did , did n't i ?
i do n't think i 'll persuade you . you 'll do it or you wo n't . dr. bloom is working an it anyway , and he 's the best ...
my money 's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife .
well , this is a unique confession to say the least , son . and not exactly the most interesting one i 've ever heard either . you sure you do n't want to talk about ... oh , carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe ... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad 's bed ?
if you ca n't make it back , i 'll hold up at the douglas shaft . stop worryin ' . you sound like a mother hen .
the spiders .
i know . pirates from sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships .
you 're evil , maxine .
why are you getting dressed ?
that son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere .
thank you .
vaughn , get the m-seventy-nine ready .
because you did n't ask them ? i do n't blame them for being angry . why did n't you explain what happened ?
switch hands .
grant . oh my god . what happened to your -- ?
that was wonderful !
we do n't know that --
good example ! good example of what i 'd like to know ? he did n't even kill nobody ... he could n't do it no more .
vegas . can you arrange that ?
someone must have got a shot off . he was n't exactly a moving target .
so , you must be the red dragon .
very well .
wussup , victor .
please , god . let this be it .
i do .
really ! listen , heather , i wo n't take but a minute of your time . it 's just that we have something to propose to you , and wonder if you 'd stop by the offices . bob 'd love to talk to you .
in the direction you want to go .
but where are my wife and son ? what 's become of them ? where is marmont ? where is mortier ?
hola , viejo .
i hate to quibble with you rob , but she married her first boyfriend . kevin bannister .
i do n't know . i do n't have any .
i 've got you worried , have n't i ?
what do you want me to say ?
i ca n't help it . i ca n't tell a soul . i did n't even tell guild .
i 've seen it .
do n't you know ?
let go of the belt ! what are you doing ? you got mad at me for trying to save the other guy .
no problem .
what are we gon na do -- ?
what 's wrong with him ?
i can safely say that michael myers is now in your hands .
sal , i 'm sorry about this . but we can get outta this thing . there 's a way outta this .
i am being exploited ! where are you going ?
i have no sympathy for either good or evil . i have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity . what unhappy people most of you are !
so ... that sure is something .
it 's a helluva disease .
jesus ... it 's my fault . they drew a black line over me and now i 'm passing it on . i 'm passing it to you , too .
my six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman . right after he retires from the majors . we just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday .
this smells good .
... you take care of yourself , johana .
oh yeah .
i assume this is on rex ?
get out of here .
there ! happy ? i asked for one thing from you ... one simple promise . now look what you 've done !
you have to sleep for three .
crafts ?
big balls .
no . i was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom , but that can wait . i just have to get my shoes .
we 'll just get off at the next stop .
move it .
which way did he go ?
leavin ' , boy ?
can i make sandwiches ... ?
bob , do you remember mary ?
i 'm fine . nothing 's wrong .
you have no right to do this .
meaning ?
that 's me .
count to twenty . i抣l be there .
close . we 're so hush-hush , even we know nothing about it . now let 's see , there 's coconut cake , date and walnut ; i recommend the rum baba ...
with great tits . i 'm going to ask her if i can touch them .
did you carry a gun ?
we ca n't help it , we ... we 've got ta ...
i did n't have my camera with me .
that thunder 's sure somethin ' .
carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed --
what , you think i 'm kidding ? i guarantee it . an inch more flank . boys upstairs get hot . bingo , you 're an anchor-woman .
i 've got a lot of thinking to do . 'sides , the room was getting too crowded for me .
i do n't know . maybe we should watch the tape to be sure .
... and all i 'm saying is i think we ought to try and get along with them . that 's all .
i might be able to save you . if i knew enough .
mrs. rand ...
get him out of there . i thought i told you people --
kurt does n't look too good .
okay .
i have excellent long-term memory .
look . i thought we talked about this , i thought we said ...
i ca n't .
rules are rules .
ca n't help it . you 're doing time for me . no greater love , as the man says . wish you 'd tell me why .
we 're doing the best we can . now if you 'll excuse me ...
could i try that ?
what time did he say to be here ?
honest to goodness , i hate you .
no blood . as i left a neighbor , an old woman , waved to me . i went to her house . she has the little girls . they are safe .
but charlie ? why me ? why ?
please , honey , let me in .
it 's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know , spontaneously .
mrs. bledsoe ?
those boys , those sad , raging boys ... they came to me as the needy do . and like many of the needy , they were rude . like all the needy , they took . and like all the needy , they needed . father . i knew them ; they learn in our school . and play in our schoolyard . and they are good boys .
i 've all ready gone six hundred miles ... i ca n't do it again .
hey , where 's erica ?
tuttle ! ... mumble ! you 've had that scab tuttle here , have n't you ?
when you were gone last year -- where were you ?
carry out this tragic folly if you will -- but i for one will not be a part of it . i will stay here in freedonia .
hoity-toity ! john best , what 's the matter here ?
fifteen , at the most .
people think it 's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite , which is not to be ignored , but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it . otherwise we would n't do it . after all , we 're not fucking stupid . at least , we 're not that fucking stupid . take the best orgasm you ever had , multiply it by a thousand and you 're still nowhere near it . when you 're on junk you have only one worry : scoring . when you 're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite . got no money : ca n't get pished . got money : drinking too much . ca n't get a bird : no chance of a ride . got a bird : too much hassle . you have to worry about bills , about food , about some football team that never fucking wins , about human relationships and all the things that really do n't matter when you 've got a sincere and truthful junk habit .
i need to speak to you .
can i give her a message ?
he 's a nice guy . vie ought to keep in touch with him .
sal , that might be fine , you own this , but rarely do i see any italian americans eating in here . all i 've ever seen is black folks . so since we spend much money here , we do have some say .
it 's tougher than it looks .
i 'm sorry , i usually would call rajeev , but i did n't know what to do so i called mr. bianchinni .
kick a buck .
oh , baby , i 'm so sor ...
alright miss , calm down . i just need this lane open . i need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder !
you do n't like moore ? since when ?
objection ! speculation .
what about `` essential energy '' the soul . does that go into the air too ? you think there 's a good energy and a bab energy ?
it 'll work faster if i have an account number .
113 continued :
your mother got a brother -- alphonse --
i 'll betcha ! that 's bullshit and i 'll betcha ! you 're fulla shit !
i was dead . and came back to life . an eeg machine . where 's eugene ?
whatever goes bang .
i 'm a parent , i do n't have the luxury of principles .
one of my few virtues is discretion .
in a better place . i hope .
carl , establish contact with that deputy we met earlier . he 'll be more useful now .
well , they will be .
what brings you out here ...
that 's very generous .
explain what ? how you were waiting until the time was right , and then you were going to dump me for her ?
it 's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you .
n'about ten minutes . what was your movie about ?
she 's off her fucking rocker --
rio de janeiro , maybe ?
give me that !
where are we going ?
name ?
yeah , but , buddy --
how much it there ?
wellie well , dr. bright . you 're just in time .
when could i look round ?
why ? you interested ?
english , yankee . it 's the same . my name is daniel . daniel hochstetler . you look plain , book . very plain .
he 's in trouble , all right . but i do n't have any idea what it is .
you killed them .
just the soda , please . cooper heads down the hall . filmore watches him leave , sighs , then turns and smiles at the general manager :
yeah .
norbert -- you come , too . let him go , harold . let him go .
hey -- look officer -- i can explain everything . it was just -- you know , everything all of a --
but if you could , you would ?
north island , have you got any additional information ? over .
twenty grand . and of course i still keep the rug .
sorry , mom . thanks . hey , chip , think i could get 50c for vanilla ice .
him ?
what 's the problem here ?
what was that for ? i know you can take punches . i can hit you from now to doomsday . what the fuck does that prove ?
will you do me one favor ?
i owe you nothing .
we can get the war started tomorrow , but it wo n't be pretty .
how many shots you say you heard ?
you do . and once i 'm out of here , i 'll remind you of the best parts .
it 's your game . i 've never played this before .
where you going ?
well la de da .
i do n't know yet .
are they still operative ?
but sir --
we 're looking for the funniest costume ! and the scariest ! and the most imaginative ! and the best costume of all !
gopher , everett ?
there 's no standing between a fool and his folly . if you must babble your news to him he 's at the fisherman 's tryst . it 's the inn at pennycuik . you can use macfarlane 's horse and gig to get there . he 'll welcome the ride back .
it was all in czech was n't it .
i 've got that two o'clock in town .
yeah , of course .
yes , sir .
yeah , how ?
oh .
because he was my friend .
okay , then let 's make it easy . it was a mistake . do n't make me feel guilty now that it 's over , let 's forget about it .
then , take blood parasites . it 's yours . now we each have three .
so she seems .
but you promised ! i 've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised !
mm .
w-w-we-we 've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we 'd try with artificial insemination .
i 'm quite serious . look at all the charity and clinic work we do . up until thirty years ago , the concept of vaccine was unheard of .
did you just hear what i just heard ?
come on , kid , let 's see if there 's any food in the house .
forget it , sugar , will you ? forget about saxophone players . you 're going to meet a millionaire - a young one .
i know , honey . i just --
i thought i 'd gotten off the main ...
i get horny as hell for other women . i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman .
thanks .
believe what ?
yes sir .
i guess i just do n't understand anything .
he does it right in front of him .
another precedent gone . this has been a very interesting evening . i 'll call you a cab . gasoline rationing , time of night .
i can see why you put your faith in him . he 's a genuine ... good guy ... good at what he does . that 's rare .
dano , should n't we stop and help your mother ?
r.e.m. 's . rapid eye movements . the eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
mmmm-hmm . where 's the , uh , 'dragon 's lair ? ' where do you live ?
si . tecate . you like to fight ?
they can stay for two weeks . i do n't care .
i 'm glad .
randy stetz . her boyfriend . we 've questioned him , searched his place . did n't find anything .
investigator ...
my harrier . join us , colonel .
quiet ! shhh !
why , malcolm ?
look ... i do n't know . what am i supposed to be , his keeper or something ? yeah , he 's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head . right ?
you do n't know that . even i can not see their fate .
how was i to tell you ? by writing a letter ? with what , my asinine bride ?
i was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that . no . i am not afraid . it is strange .
i 'm sorry , mr. dobisch . you know i like to help you guys out -- but it 's sort of late -- so why do n't we make it some other time ?
it 's gon na be fine . these people are ready for anything .
... but the word `` yet ... '' yeah , you know what , i 'd get the impression that you wanted to see it . otherwise you 'd say you did n't really want to .
what < u > you < /u > get < u > from < /u > us is a date . a place . `` in the parking lot of a jack-in-the-box in north miami . '' at such-and-such time , an eighteen- wheeler will be there . keys in the ignition . ready to roll . you pick it up . and you drive it ... ... away .
no . want to make you into something new . that nobody recognizes ...
please . please stay .
rose ... i do n't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters . this has been a dream of ours for a long time . sometimes i doubt your commitment to sparkle motion .
any i.d . ?
thank you , mr. scott . we were to return to spacedock , the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear .
well -- she 's dead .
because he called me .
alright donald , alright , but just let him talk . i want to hear all viewpoints . i truly do . i truly am .
did these sticks make a whistling sound ?
a ghost ?
are you lying to me ?
and i say i 'm dead ... and i move .
surely , you do n't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same ?
you got ta go , we 're pinned down !
oh ? so you are a new man ?
you betcha --
you saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning . in time you perverted the truth . you sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan . how little you understand .
jesus , you 're caustic .
i ... yeah , i 'm okay . i 'm fine .
what ?
fuck you care ... ?
okay , we got ... one , two ... three ... two caddies and poe 's mustang .
he 's not crazy .
we 'd like to ask you some questions about daniel zavitz .
no , i 'm sorry , for pushing you out .
silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth , it 'll kill everything in the vicinity .
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point , then ... ?
nothing . i guess i just wanted to thank you .
it 's very warm out tonight .
did you see ? ... i put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts . the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies .
if and when he calls , please do n't forget to ask him if he 's seen mantan .
maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function , it 'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain .
yeah , i 'm feelin ' fine .
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ?
i 'm just saying , i know what it 's like to lose something you love . to see it slip away , and know it 's never coming back .
oh ... uh ... it 's just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support ...
well where are ya , what are ya , drunk ?
over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life .
well ... how have you been ?
not only did you knock me down , you stepped on my new white air jordans that i just bought and that 's all you can say , `` excuse me ? ''
where are the tapes , graham ?
that 's what i 'd do if i could . nothing wrong with that . hey ben , elaine 's coming down from berkeley soon . i want you to call her up this time .
i 'm doing fine . theo wants to deal .
you seem one to me .
cause if you get in a bind --
lower .
a book , huh ? i guess that means you can read ... an ' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms ... but then , like you told old andy there , you ai n't armed , are you , bob ?
that 's the one .
whoa , i knew you were going to say that . i absolutely anticipated that , nick . but i said to myself , charlie , charlie , we can move up on this , so go find nicklaus ... he 'll be pissed for a moment , but then it 'll dawn on him --
this week .
hey . hey , those are my sunglasses you 're wearing .
honestly ! you cut me to the core ! what 's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when i finally succumb -- when at long last , i pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion ? have you no faith in your own medicine ?
no you do n't .
our home , jim ! a kidnapper , a murderer , who knows !
yes , thanks .
you know what ? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone .
hnnn .
you know the motherfucker 's a bail bondsman , do n't ya ? you know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ?
they also found my two beam scale in the garage .
quit ? she wants to quit ?
i 'm relaxed .
no ma'am .
and if they saw me pitch the way i did today -- they 'd hire me just to strike out babe ruth !
'i am not a missing link . '
an hour after you picked it up !
hi , baby .
here -- here it is . here 's your pocketbook , kringelein .
yes .
evolution does n't work that fast . something pushed that thing to take the leap . we need to find another specimen .
so ! speak !
he said he was dissatisfied ... and was going back .
this is the cross-reference of clerks who 've worked on orlac claims ?
... you there ? norman ?
this is totally different . i 'm talking about avoiding what you 're talking about . that 's the distinction . i have not made the commitment yet . i am not married . i have not said the words . in a few days , i might get married , and if i do , then i wo n't be doing stuff like this anymore . otherwise , what 's the whole point of getting married ?
that would n't be too good , would it ?
tell me later .
of course - of course ! hands in ...
take the stand !
i love marge .
right .
that 's frightening .
how 'd you know about that ?
i already made an appointment for later today .
an ' masseria 's got seven hundred .
are you sure these are the coordinates ?
not anymore .
before we do this , i want you to know i 'm sorry .

uh ... uh ... i ...

this you 're familia ' with .

he 's a very private person , actually .
that your daughter ?
nothing ! i simply existed . so what was the answer ? a jealous woman , right ? a clinging possessive mother . wrong . with all due respect to oedipus , i do n't think that was the case at all .
but , sir ...
that 's not to tough .
jesus , james , you should 've told someone .

you got ta have a call sign that 's just your own ... never changes ... you have to recognize it immediately . then , if someone shouts `` wolf , break left ! `` ..you react right away .
you 'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday ... stop planning for tomorrow ... until you find ... let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time ?
are you still involving me in your crash ?
no . just the first one .

i know , mom . it was great ... really .
shit ! temp 's dropping ! we should have left this rock an hour ago !
you 're still a writer .
we got information that there 's no shit in the street -- it 's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well .
you 're absolutely right . i 'm the first to admit it . if this were a scary movie , i 'd be the prime suspect .
and she 's never wrong .
we 'll last longer then we will against that death star ... and we might just take a few of them with us .
to the fleet .
i do n't know what you look like , boy . as far as i can tell , you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night . you live in this town -- or on your way from here to there ?
jesus , honey ... he always joked about you < u > curing < /u > him , but i never realized what you cured him < u > from < /u > .

you went for it .
what 's she like ?
[ beat ] i know it does n't make sense . it does n't even make sense to me .
did you see how i did that ? magic was n't it ?
you think anyone who 's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser .
well , if you 're innocent , then you have nothing to worry about .
well ... if you 're not gon na fire me i might as well quit .
why ? i mean , which are you , scared or selfish ?
i ca n't be staying long anyway .
i understand ...

hardly a worry , sir .
dude , get wisdom . we 're about to board a seven hour flight . the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets . what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake ? you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes ?
but ... how is he going to breathe ?
stop tripping .
but i never had a wife , children , a home like this .
of course not .
you 're happy for me and victor .

perhaps i 'd better start calling you doctor again , mrs. peel --
i know the type . i 'm a psychologist .
i have no doubt that you 're a good dad . you can tell a lot from a person 's voice . but something must be missing if jonah feels that you 're still under a cloud .
turn the tapes back on .

and am i not fair ?
oh ! no ! no ... of course not ... it 's just i had n't expected it to be quite so big .

conspiracy ? that sounds a little farfetched .
`` get the fuck out of my house . ''
so , where 's `` weird al '' ?
i should get back .

the bible . monarchy . many wrong ideas about the government of men . my father 's people already know each man is his own nation . and only he can have dominion over himself . not kings . no man is better than any other man .

my aunt bella , sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up , anyway she always said `` curses were made to be broken '' . course , she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks , so it was n't quite so profound ...
what ... ? < u > oh < /u > .
aw , come on , baby ... you 're the girl of my dreams .
no .
arlight , then . cheers .
they 're worth less points .
well , i 'd never be so bold as to speak for all men , but as or myself and a few of my friends , that 's definitely the case . there 's a lot of actresses out there you like , and there 's some you have crushes on . but there 's always one who you love . and with her it 's sorta like going steady .
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance . yet there you are , doing all the listening ! you are alone here , are n't you ? it would drive me crazy .
skiing ?
good to see you too , elaine .
hey , i just ...

nice to meet you .
two hundred and one thousand , six hundred and forty-seven .
cheraw falls .
yo , your gettin ' me all upset here .
and there ! there you see ? her key is on the rack !
just make sure you 're not caught . if you find something , you 've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules . if you find nothing -- he 's clear .
no . but i liked jesus ' style .
yes -- we do .
ooo , i 'm sure mrs. caldwell will love that .
i still got ta do it . wasting time is half my job .
oh , you 're changing your mind --
i 've never been taken off an assignment in my life . give me twenty- four hours and i 'll have him for you .
oh ? did they do that sort of thing way back in your day ?
how did she smell ? did her puss stink ?
that so ?
it 's just that , you know , i was thinking about how , in class , you 're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones . and , do n't get me wrong . i 'm not saying the book is n't really great -- i mean , really great -- but at times it 's , well , very detailed , you know , with the genealogies of everyone 's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and i do n't know , maybe i 'm wrong , but it sort of reads , in places , like , well , actually , like ... ... you did n't make any choices at all . and i was wondering if it might not be different if , maybe , when you wrote , you were n't always ... under the influence .
yes , sir .
what , what 's there to < u > think < /u > about ? the scene 's perfect ... i , i get to say ...
he did n't come !
de nada .
now you are confusing me , mrs de moraes .
i 'm glad to hear that , paul , i really am . but you have to know -- when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine , they 're not going to say , `` ooh , good , paul sheldon can finally write what we 've always wanted : an esoteric , semi- autobiographical character study .
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else .
yeah , that 's right , you got it girl .
oh , i had them removed .
no .
beautiful . what time are you off ... ... christy ?
it 's not good , ben - i 'm sure you can feel it .
my son ! do you really think , ma ... .
`` and iiiiiiiiiyeiiiii will always love you oooooowuoooooooo will always love you . ''
goodbye , charlotte .
mr. kross , i 'm not here to sell you my stock . on the contrary , i 'm here to buy yours .
then it 's true , dammit ! i had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you . when the monotones did `` book of love 棗 chapter four you break up , wo n't you give it just one more chance ... '' i 'm thinking did we break up ? 'cause if we did , i do n't even know about it ! . i thought we cleared all that up yesterday . did that maynard g. beatnik give you what you wanted ?
oh man . that 's universally stupid , man !
so they tell the kid to throw the world series , or else , huh ?
that 's because he 's a fucking wacko . never met a self-promotion scheme he did n't like . what 's he doing now ?

well , we 've got --
come here . see if we can move it .
like do you believe in heaven ?
of course .
okay -- i do n't know about this .
well , i 'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document , and the name printed and signed there .
where did you get pilgrim from ?
i 1ove you , rowan . i 've always loved you . i only wanted to be in your thoughts . to bring myself into your thoughts - so i could be as we are now .
yeah , but he has got to tell his dad he is about to lose his bar .

oh ! i got a question . jesus , this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit , listen to me . i sound like some fucking fanboy . i 'm sorry , but i just got to ask you . everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian , nicholai talinkov --

i love you man

now this is important . make sure you leave the house when you make the call . you understand ? do you hear me ? it 's important . call from an outside phone . i mean it .
tyler ...
you can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye , buddy !
dead or alive , they 'll stick me in there with oswald . another lunatic acting alone ,
we ca n't let him run around . he knows too much .
we did n't get that far .
no .
is there something wrong with that ?
it may be lilly , but it is n't suicide .
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
you 're a charming liar . you < u > know < /u > , herbert 's too dull to be suspicious about anything -- even when i suddenly decided to come to europe at a few hours ' notice --
you 're a bad , bad girl , stephanie .
you want something , old man ?
what sad news ? did her cancer come back ?
i do n't wan na go out there at < u > all < /u > ...

we 'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here . barbara and i worked very hard on this house .
uh , well , anyway , so i 'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia . kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology . i wrote to derrida to see if he 'd like to do the narration . but everything 's still kind of in development at this point .
better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night .
no . i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat . he might be listening now .
i 'm sorry but you 're ...
you may think you know what 's going on , but you do n't .
uhh ... nothing .
it 's my response to the issue of a woman 's right to choose ... it 's something i feel super-strongly about .
what do i have to do ?
i might have a solution .
he knows who you are ! he 's afraid ! i can tell !
you have no right here !
i said sit down !
too right , youth . that 's why i need you to lead the troops .
what do you want ?
look , carol , maybe walter 's done you a big favor . you always said you wanted to get out of town . go for it . and be happy , goddamnit , i 'm rooting for you .
now what ?
we have no alternative . with only six minutes left , we 'll just barely make it .
maybe he gave them an argument .
let 's get something straight . you do n't know me . i do n't know you . but i know what you 're about . keep your distance from this house -- and from jamie .
well it 's not here -- you 're wasting your time and you 're pissing me off !
drop the bogus forgery charge and i 'll forget about your generous friends slash clients .
i am harold ryan , her husband . i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts -- as a professional soldier . i have killed thousands of other animals as well -- for sport .

good night , steve .
what just happened ?
were < i > you < /i > alone ?
really ?
for me ?
course he 's alive . he 's buckaroo banzai .
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people . curare , ephedrine -- we 've found some amazing things .
what the fuck is going on here ? ! you ca n't install a simple goddamn double implant ? !
yo , check it . this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills . you hear me .

pete , uh , i do n't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing ...
because i am a new man , susan . i am a man of vision . your problem , susan , is that you 're always looking down . if you 'd just look up you 'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost . they focus on what can be gained .
yeah , if it opens the door .
oh , you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed ?
all i want is thirty-nine sixty . if you 'll give me a check i 'll get out of this place . it gives me the jitters .

totalled together , these five checks from five different accounts , they equal one million dollars .
me like-y .
i know honey . just remember what i said , we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think .
i wo n't say good luck , walter .
on the durham road . the pantiles .
suck me ... beautiful ?
that 's awful .
it 's her -- from the institute . if we play our cards right , we may learn when those whales are really leaving .
well , james , you did shoot the head of the english department 's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia .
dammit , carl ! ! ! !
look ! i did n't ask to be in you . do n't blame me for it . you did it .
do my ears deceive me ?

do they come with batteries ?
it 's in michigan . honestly , what do i have in common with those people ? or with anyone ?
this has nothing to do with walter .
doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .
oh .
who did you work with to get the --
before your time , pop . mid-sixties . five or six hits . he 's got a club down in the fillmore now .
are you sure ?
yes , sir . rubinstein takes out a notebook .
sure thing . look , i 've got enough , between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts . you can go home . gim me til morning . find out who he is . until then , do n't sweat it , huh ? just your random bad cheese trying to hole you .
no , i 'm not kidding you , < u > philip < /u > .
uh -- twenty-one , but there 's no alarm in sector twenty-one .
at the moment ? carl smith .
but nothing did .
we held each other . it was better than sex . what i need he gave me great .
oh , now do n't get all jealous , ed . i got a little something for you , too .
i 'm mary 's sister .
and what of the enterprise ?
no -- please listen ! they 're coming ... coming for me and my baby .
i will be glad to leave this island . it has too much of that old dark world about it . i will be glad to leave it and that girl 棗
yes . from the highest authority . there are two conditions . the u.n. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles .
c'mon . i do n't want any jones about this .

i know ruby . he 's very big on respect . likes me very much .
circumstances have changed , jerry .

i 'm okay . it 's going well !

you 've been reading for hours .
you owe me . besides , i 'm cute .
mr. fitzsimmons is a very prominent man .
did you know that eskimos have not one , but fifty words for snow . it 's because they have so much of it .
you call that a compliment ?
what , did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in ?
that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine .
i ca n't believe i listened to one word of his shit .
hey , i抦 doing the best i can ... i抎 like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers ...
i 'm sorry , daniel , but you have to admit it 's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized . it 's got to mean something .
no sir , we do n't state that . we 're countin --
well , technically it 's not mid evil - - it 's renaissance .
eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ... five - net - launch-ers ...
yeah , she 's okay .
partially ...
why ith dat newth ?
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her ... in my house .
what you 've done is make the entire physics department look foolish . you compare yourself to einstein ; your colleagues compare you to bozo the clown .
so i want the money and i want it now .
what kind of bar is it if ya ca n't get a martini ? !
why did n't you cross at the crosswalk ?

now , why ca n't i find a girlfriend like that ? brings him lunch everyday , thoughtful , sweet , legs from here to there --
it 'll be yours if you do n't kick in with that ten bucks .
nell , it makes sense . it all makes sense . you and i , we were scaring each other , working each other up .
now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode . but we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope .
believe me , some day , you 'll feel differently .
few days ago , i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia , a doctor and his wife . what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 , which heads into philadelphia , started up a conversation with this girl , she looked homeless , seemed about eighteen maybe . they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city . nice kid , mature , did n't have much to say , but they got a sense she 's a runaway , so all through dinner the doctor 's working on her , trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone . not surprisingly , she ate her food , excused herself ... that 's the last they saw her . the reason they came to me for help , the reason i 'm coming to you , is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch ... they want to see if i can i.d . this girl , somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid 's alive , doing alright .
not exactly .
and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you ?
do n't do that !
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera .

so where do you know alan from ?
we rented a loft in sunnyvale . you know what 's the bad part ? we ca n't talk about work anymore . we 're competitors ! the venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms .
i lie to my parents every day . and every night .
well , i hope you enjoyed yourself .
i 've never been in an apartment above a store . you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them .
no , lover . i 'll see what you can do .
the recovery is very impressive .
truly - uh - splendid .
your calabrian friend , i will accept . at least costello eats pasta like us .
dylan , you go back to sleep now .

thanks .
what ? are you crazy ? we 're supposed to take pictures and split . you 're gon na blow the whole program .
i certainly hope you --
yeah , but doc , is n't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease ? so you tell me , today , there 's no danger , and i go home , and i hold my baby , and six months from now i hear on the news : `` whoops ! we were wrong . ' you < u > can < /u > carry it on your clothes , your skin , and now i 've got to worry about my kid . what are you doing ?
well , you 're lucky it 's not you .

your first boyfriend . what do you think ? any sparks left ?
raymond , grab the tapes . we 're leaving !

it 's all right . i really do know them .
they 're already dead . they ca n't feel a thing .

you have no idea what this is doing to your body .
whoever hits him 'll be hit , if those men are any good . and i presume you ca n't get in .
i am , there 's too much flesh on me .

me too .
i fucking vouched for you . i vouched for you and you fucked me .
yeah . and it 's better than not believing it their faces are inches apart .
where can i meet this man ?
good thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me .
why do n't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much ?
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan . the shuttle 's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue , flooded both ships with pure oxygen . there was a spark and both ships were incinerated . the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat . captain miller was able ...
do you care to tell me what mrs. white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house ?
hello .
it was a great show , dad ...
i thought you had a girlfriend .
i should maybe talk to you .
she 's my daughter , tom .

we think he 's had a change of heart . so we should be celebrating .
no , no , no . no exploitation . this is serious匓ut do n't you find it a little funny too , at the same time ?
is there a mr. macaulay in the house ? oh , it 's you .
i know it 's hard to believe , son , but this place , this little place this was n't a theater then , this was a palace ! any man , woman , child , you , me , it did n't matter , you bought your ticket and you walked in and you ...
we need all our fuel anyway .
so i can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist ?
he 's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress .
that 's lunacy . i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that 's equally as inventive as yours . but it would be conjecture , not proof .
we 're gon na get rid of him -- allende , i mean -- just as fast as we can . he 's on the top of the list .
artie !
have i told you what this man did ? *
ms. kruczynski ?
guts ! a crummy pigeon who 's looking to get his neck wrung ! you should have you should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours . he was all right hanging around for laughs . but this is business . i do n't like goofoffs messing in our business .
i need that voucher ! i told you a week ago it was important !

the refrigerator ?
gut feeling .
arctic warrior , arctic warrior , arctic warrior . this is united states coastguard station north island . over .

'bye , jane , i 'll see you in church in a couple weeks .
steady , boy . just keep telling yourself you 're a girl .

how many people do you think we 've talked to already , outside the radio , i mean ?
good . cause we just got some new info and i do n't need you getting freaky on me .
how is your wife , fredo ... your marriage ?

it 's essential to his recovery ; a purgative for the toxins in his mind .
i like it . i like it . i 'm sorry i do n't seem more appreciative .
that guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy .
you can not die .
the british worry so about their empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children .

i 'm a scientist . i have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is , argon is going to get whatever he wants , so if i were you , i 'd give it to him .
that was n't necessary , buddy . i got this under control .
are you ready to put him in ?
listen , flo , cut it out . hard-tack is pretty sore .
why did you come back ? to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station ?

i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .
which was ?
: wait . do you know any gay guys ?
wait a second , are you like the steven king of france or something ...
you 're comfortable . this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you 've fashioned for yourself .
hi . it 's a pleasure . i 'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here . i bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere .
you wo n't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out .

and so they kill the goose . i , i , i 'll ... and a fuckin ' man , worked all his life has got to ...
did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds ?

she said you took your kid to the each . every second sunday . zoo or beach or the ballgame . y'have the option ... what about me ?
executive clemency ...
not anymore . surely the odd confluence of events has n't escaped you , clarice . crawford dangles you before me . then i give you a bit of help . do you think it 's because i like to look at you , and imagine how good you would taste ... ?

i guess it 's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
what do you think my father would do if i told him i did n't want to be a lawyer anymore ?
and these archies should be over here with the richie rich 's .

do something ! stall them !
can you lift the furnace . i need money .
poor trevor .
were . give me the tracking monitor !
well ...
go ! ! !
did you see who that was ?
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
pearl and john .
not pure evil . that 's correct .
stop it . the money 's fine . it 's generous but you 've shortchanged me on the story .
is that paul goodman ? no . and be nice to the host because he 's publishing my book . hi , doug ! douglas wyatt . `` a foul-rag-and-bone shop-of- the-heart . ''
yes , sir .
he 's right there ... he can read my mind and he 'll show me the way out of this . the sky is going to open up ... and then he will reveal himself to me .
all right , i 'm a child . have it any way you want . but i 'm going back to my own apartment , where i should have lived in the first place . but no , i got to listen to you and move here . all right . if you want to live with me , anne , okay . but the sign outside will say `` mr. stew smith '' and you 'll have to be `` mrs. stew smith '' or there 's nothing doing . no more anne schuyler 's husband桯e has his bag all packed by this time . he snaps it shut viciously , lifts it off the chair , picks up his hat , and notices mrs. schuyler staring open-mouthed at him . 梐nd here 's some more news for you . you can take your red room , your green room , your left wing and your right wing , and you know what you can do with them ! come on , gallagher .

not yet , the wife in working on our first . you got any kids back on the ranch ?
are you out of your mind ?
does n't it make you proud to be scottish ?
i was thinking the same thing . he must be local . it 's logical for him to assume that the police would be there , but he recognized andy 's voice and called him by name . what about this ?
they gave her the wrong anesthetic .
i 'm always alone , mrs. swicker , you know that .
saving the treats for bob ?
no . no , sir . i loved that condo . i loved every stick of furniture . the lamps , the chairs , the rugs , were me . the dishes were me . the plants were ...
... and also to bring medicine .
you 're hurting .
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound . ever notice , lila ?
he 's seriously disturbed ...
and if we do n't , they 're gon na be riding high in a brand new kenworth .
no , really .
i could n't get you in .
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine ?
what do you play ?
and he left when he found out what sethe did ? what you say casts a different light on it , i guess ... i thought-
we have a little arrangement . anything happens to me , you 're dead .
look again for fuck sake !
this is going to be a real drag . i thought you wanted to go fast .
alright , the beige one .
seems to be back to normal , sir .
there is no us .
what does this mean ? now we got the fbi , my team is expendable ? i 'm working my ass off , is anybody listening ? why ruben , anyway ? he and nikko do n't even get on together ...
he 's been there and has n't found what he wants . can you spare someone ? there may be people hurt .
i do n't understand .
did you get rid of mark ?
she works for them .
but you 're not enrolled .
you wanted to see me ?
get out , spike . i 'm so sorry .
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt . you had sex last night and you feel guilty .
yeah , harding , where do you breathe anyway ?
so i 'll be the first one to go in then ?
mind your own business , father .
jeremy , why do n't you go sleep with your mom ?
ahh , look , right now 's not very ...
oh , jesus .
i 'm sorry , jack , but i ca n't shoot you .
it was jamie lloyd . she came back , as i knew she would one day . and whatever has brought her back has brought michael back as well .
listen , arlo ...
yeah . it 'll be nice . it 'll be a change of pace . that club shit gets boring .
come on , let 's check the bite radius .
aunt edith . how did she ... die ?
hey -- you ca n't do that .
not much here . jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia ... that 's about it .
poor creature ...
why did you leave the agency ?
did n't much look like you were hanging drapes .
i 'd really feel stupid if we did n't bring anything back home .
and i want doucet .
: ... hearts . and to themselves in these days that try their souls ...
dad , it 's not about that . i just need to know that it 's possible for two people to stay happy together forever . or at least for a few years .
that 's been noted . but where does it lead us ? unless you have something more to add .
it was n't a woman .
no ! i want a debutante on a horse to step on me . leave me alone ! !
forget it . it 's a family prayer . my father , his father before him that sort of shit .
uh-oh .
then i 'll just christen the jug , with your permission , stone . somehow or other , waiting 's wonderfully shorter with a jug .
i have n't seen him . he probably came in through the south entrance .
i need the money .
what a thoughtful , ever-lovin ' thing to do-
i would n't talk .
open it .
you can not stay here ... i 'm sorry .
all right . these are the choices : microwave ovens , pocket calculators , walkmans , digital watches and miniature tv 's .
my hero .
is that jango ?
would you like something to nibble -- apricots , soaked in honey -- quite why , no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots , and makes them taste like honey , and if you wanted honey , you 'd just buy honey , instead of apricots , but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them .
hey ... you guys ok ?
< u > fine < /u > ? look here !
oh ! that black box in our cell ?
well what you reading it for ?
that 's very nice of ted , but i 'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting .
no , i really ca n't . i find it healthy never to characterize people i do n't know or conversations i have n't heard . i do n't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else . last time i saw ann she left here very ... confused , i would say . and upset .
he killed a man worked for him the other night .
say , who 's putting up this dough ?
all right . enough . look ...
the arms dealer .
no , ma i was at first -- but not no more .
uh , uh , this is great . i mean , i love e.e . cummings , but i ca n't let you get this .
the red knight !
i never knew about the sailor the- ory , ross . he might have that one little thing i need in his files ?
donny-nothin ' !
now , let 's hear from you . . .
you 're giving me the creeps .
c'mon --
get to the ship !
no .
loads of ice-cream by vada sultenfuss i like ice-cream a whole lot , it tastes good when days are hot , on a cone or in a dish , this would be my only wish , vanilla , chocolate or rocky road , even with pie a la mode .
holy shit . holy ...
now you may call it an unreasoning optimism . you may call it obtuse . but the plain fact is we still have ... close to ... close to ...
because your writing continues , unchecked .
she never will . that is my job . it has been for a long time . you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen . i made her a star . i can not let her be destroyed .
my master requires the fort be destroyed . but , for you and your comrades , there is no privilege that will be denied . none of your men will see the inside of a prison barge . they 're free to go so long as they return to england and fight no more on this continent , and the civilian militia return to their farms .
randal , twelve minutes is not a game ! jesus , it 's barely a warm-up !
visit those foreclosin ' sonofaguns down at the indianola savings and loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm . hell , you ai n't no kind of man if you ai n't got land .
she got gaps . i got gaps -- together we fill the gaps .
where 's jill ? what have you done to her ? where is she ? !
we all know what you did , pike . i do n't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here , but --
i mean , the whole sanitation thing . joseph lister ... 1895. before antiseptics there was no sanitation , especially in medicine .
what are you talking about ?
we want some grass .
when i 'm not thinking about wally . i 'm not good at being alone . oh , goodness . you meant ... yes , i 'm fine . i ... ... i do n't suppose you 've seen a lobster yet .
two years ago , buddy .
skipper , you 're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is .
oh no . now for the fire . strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this .
uh ... sheriff ... uh ...
maybe you 'll understand this , because you know john , but he confuses me sometimes .
who ?
but the most interesting thing here is that i do n't see the rose tattoo that i 've heard about on your back .
we know what you 're up to .
i 'm stumped .
call me next week . we 'll talk about it .
a kiss .
now pay attention , 007. we have n't much time to demonstrate your new q toys .
yes , sir .
cuuuute !

well , you know where it is .
please . do n't worry about him . and above all , do n't antagonize him .
you and me ?
what ? this is n't normal ?
oh .
razinin .
i know the guy leaves a sign .
i am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the resolution -- without further delay . the senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or --
i do n't know . how long before it kills us ?
how much ?
i understand . good night .
i do n't care . she 's always been neutral in politics and that 's not going to change .
you speak french .
what do you want ?
his stinking breath caused my eyes to run , that 's all .
hello there . well , well ! if it is n't the man about town !
yes . rooms thirteen and fourteen are on indian land .
hey , ros . nice view , huh ?
what are you gon na do ?
i 'm here with jenny .
i nominated you as a possible candidate . you were eduard 's good friend . he read me some of your work .
excuse me ?
i once heard itzhak perlman guest star with the chicago symphony orchestra . he played rachmaninov 's vocalize opus 34. no . 14. it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music i ever heard . i actually forgot where i was for a time . you seem surprised ?
starling ... ?
get a pen and don抰 ask any questions .
maybe i did ... try new orleans first ... lula ca n't ever stop talkin ' 'bout that town .
dr. frederick fronkonsteen .
what kind of doctor are you ?
she e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her .
aw , you 're tough .
what are you talking about ? where 's that bonding strip ? !
smith . i am agent smith .
looks like pooch 's doing okay .
oh , mr. rand , of course . right this way , sir .
i do n't know you .
what scene ?
maybe you should take this .
aw , hey now , that was a compliment .
vicki , if i say anything cryptic , or ... ambiguous , i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it . because even if it does n't sound that way ... that 's how i 'll mean it .
hell is precisely what is going on , joey . and we have to stop it . i because of a special obligation , you because you 're the only person who can help . and because you know what is right , and just , and true . will you walk with me a while ?
why are you so good at math but not in english ?
oh -- great .
that 's right . layaway . something you would n't know anything about , you cheapskate .
do n't you know it !
i do n't know .
uh , dad , you know i 'm 16 .
had the fbi here once before . back in the fifties when hap was running the place .
i do n't know .
just like we thought , it 's a routine problem . nurse , who 's in charge of operating room preparations ?
well , do n't let me keep you from anything .
sorry , sir . uh ... here 's what we got .
you 're really crazy .
stay calm , ray . we 'll find him . claude ! has anyone seen claude ?
the milkmaid 's daughter ?
well , mommy , get me to the big apple cause i 'm gon na rock that town like a hurricane .
what ?
yeah , that 's right , that 's it .
you tell them , lieutenant .
you took the time to pay the saleswoman .
c'mon man , did n't i do you right that time i give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit .
request ; life support systems check .
she 's good , bennie .
i ca n't get it ! i ca n't get it unless i move !
you bet i 'll worry about it . i said something wrong ?
not today . she 's learning her lines . you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget .
you should write that one down .
let me translate . i 've had some exposure to the language . the young man is from brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle .
good to see you , bill . how 's everybody doin ' ?
what are you going to tell them ? that you 're protecting a man who 's killed four people ?
i think no such a thing . sal pays you , you should work .
virginia ... ?
epps , over .
i 'm gon na make love to you . that 's what i 'm gon na do .
and so what 's with steinhart ? is it serious ?
listen , pardner ; this ai n't no time to be getting laid .
we only use this chamber for carbon freezing . if you put him in there , it 'll kill him .
balderdash !
that 's it ?
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .
what 're you talkin ' about ?
such a joker ! like your father .
surgery . the elevator disaster downtown on the news last night . cable snapped , a car dropped ten floors . non-union contractors . monsters . we 're starting with an amputation .
why not ?
you 're as crazy as he is ! he 's right ! you do n't give a damn about saving lives at all ! fuck you !
everybody likes to , do n't they ?
i 'm gon na punch you . what you want with her anyway ? you in love with her ?
they checked in alone .
the ones you built ?
so you 're models ?
you said , `` teresa banks '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?
gee , this is a surprise , mr. gittes .
lay off , i said -- if you do n't want your head handed to you .
yeah . i think it was your sinister mustache that got him .
i want you . to tell the truth .
i 'm trying to help your `` partner . '' you 're not a member of his immediate family , i could have you removed from the er .
i 'm totally over her . positively .
phantom mary ?
i never said it was !
did you pick up the car ?
theories ?
uh , i 'm very proud to say that we have eight children .
yes ?
he was your patient , doctor . if the precautions were n't sufficient , you should have notified ...
no . i do n't scare easy .
oops ! i dropped it !
billion .
yes ... well , there 's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it 's any good .
this is my uncle 's barn in iowa .
right !
yeah . let 's keep it --
let me tell you something , okay ? when you 're brought up , like the rest of us , in a place like where i was brought up , there 's not a whole lot of discussion about ... homosexuals . as a kid , you 're taught right away that queers are weird , queers are funny , they 're a danger to kids , they 're afraid to fight , and they all want to cop your joint . and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there , if you want to know the truth .
i 'm afraid i 've gotten too old for this sort of thing .
i 'm right here . i 'm fine . what 's the dog 's name ?
he was taking something out of the apartment . i 'm certain .
when are you going to let the police know ?
you just met me .
what did i say ?
guard ! ! !
go back to your room . quickly .
you mean `` goodnight . ''
this means something to you ? jenny means something to me .
are you alright ?
are you and simone ... ... getting married ?
... to be off the island tonight .
sorry , homer ...
so why does it bother you to talk about it ... chinatown ...
that is correct .
yeah , and make it extra muddy , i did n't sleep a zee last night . sheila fills a cup . buzz lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .
they were familiar when i painted them . that one 's copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago . and that 's a rembrandt .
i 'd like to speak to someone about what 's happening to me .
seventeen .
he killed a police officer .
tell me .
you were right , i had to get out of that hospital . nothing wrong with me any more .
write me a poem ?
i assure you , charles , the maiden has no greater admirer than myself . but whatever our personal feelings , we can not allow her to conduct her own private war . for the sake of the kingdom , it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne ...
she said , `` will it change my wife . '' you heard that because you were there so i 'm not crazy .
sure , it 's a blast , but listen , i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday --
who told you that ?
attractive ...
nothing . i just wan na get the fuck outta here .
you bet you should have called . you still live at home . do n't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning , do n't make me call hospitals .
ow ! cut it out butt-head .
well then you should pay him , should n't you ?
charlie ! now you 're not making sense .
i just wanted you to know , wherever you 're going or whatever you 're doing right now i want you to know that i wanted to kiss you just then .
i 'll give him five more minutes then i 'm calling the cops . i do n't need this , man . i 'm not even supposed to be here today .
i 'm sure she 's fine . seemed like a clever kid .
i 'm terribly sorry . i 'd forgotten all about you . i 'm so sorry , dear .
cellulite . what do you say i blindfold you and take you to the gym . aerobics with housewives ...
max cherry .
i feel like a dick . you must think i 'm a dick .
i asked you about school .
so do i !
there is going to be a wedding ?
what book did you want to buy ? elliot what ? book ?
leo has to take the journey , cooch .
first you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss ... no way .
in school ?
just across the bay , at the fuel depot . the men wanted to try to get home . i ca n't explain .
i wanted to apologize . i ca n't live without you .
one .
yes .
my bill .
in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville . she walked out here , she did n't go by the hotel .
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos ? that 's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week , and no taxes . careful of these tiles , they 're slippery . valentino used to dance here .
well ... no , of course not --
well it 's about time . looks like you found yourself a helper too .
you could n't be . look , barry . there 's going to be people from laura 's work there , people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums . how are you going to cope with them ?
not exactly , but with your great voice , it 'll be a huge hit . honest .
yes ...
do you have her number stored in your memory ? phone memory !
the oath . you did n't say --
ah , mrs. pembroke . i spoke to mr. schaffer at the guaranty . he 's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
no , they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise .
what 's the matter ?
fuckin ' mau mau land , that 's what it is .
do what i say ! now !
the heels on these shoes are very large . why have i never noticed this ? the heels on these shoes are grotesque .
do you pray to god , mr. lounds ?
your brains , fezzik 's strength , my steel .
you mind your own business ! she 's an old friend of mine and i like her -- what 're you going to do about it ?
races through the debris . trailed by bullets .
you supposed to be a wounded vet , motherfucka . what you do in 'nam anyway , shoot gooks or shoot hoops ?
they stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes . do you know who i am , sprout ? i am torquil , lord of the forest . my men follow no man but me , and i follow no man at all .
no , i 'm from iowa . i just work in outer space .
come on , cinderella , your pumpkin awaits .
why ?
so what do you really object to - the writer or what he 's writing about ?
i 'm not your daughter .
we also need a fucking money counter , william ! we have to get the money out by thursday and i 'll be buggered if i am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer , could n't you be a little more subtle ?
very good .
who ?
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed . she must 've forgot something and when she went to get it , she left the door open . i sneaked in and hid till she finished . then i just looked around - and pretty soon i was afraid somebody 'd notice the lights were on so i turned them off - and then i guess , i fell asleep .
do you think they would harm an innocent man , for any reason ?
and they are welcome to them . to perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes .
i do n't know ! i do n't know anything any more ! i just need to be by myself .
a fucking wheelchair ?
so what 're you doing in seattle ?
okay , what would you have done .
well , my parents are against it , and i know it 's my choice , but i was wondering ... what would you do if you were me ?
i 'll work night and day , and you wo n't have to pay me . you just have to tell me who she is .
give me your keys , don .
no . why ?
you can ?
for a fee .
it 's my shot .
what did you wish for , honey ?
i 'll go find hayes .
ya , but you ca n't do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i 'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
what ?
you 're not my father !
it comes back . flashes . my name .
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus , the thirteenth earl of crabs ?
when you bunch it together , it 's exponentially more powerful . two sticks have the power of four sticks . four sticks have the power of sixteen , and so on .
eh ... five dollars more .
okay . good night .
oh , shit .
you 've always loved the animals .
you 'll tell him i talked you out of jumping , right ? just keep me outta prison .
apipoussan !
something lecktor said .
wilfred .
charley wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground , and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him .
where he used to live . you can catch the riot squad -- it 's just going out .
i 've seen the same . i 'm not the country hick you seem to think i am .

thanks , honey .
jake , this is your father 's bedroom .
what !
hello ? computer ... ?
apparently , i was hit on the head with something really heavy , giving me a form of amnesia . when i came to , i did n't know who i was , where i was , or where i came from . luckily , i had my driver 's license or i would n't even know my name . i hoped it would tell me where i lived but it had a tallahassee address on it , and i stopped somebody on the street and they told me i was in detroit . so that was no help . but i did have some money on me , so i hopped in a cab until i saw somethin ' that looked familiar . for some reason , and do n't ask me why , that theater looked familiar . so i told him to stop and i got out .
do n't leave me now . i fear the unicorn wo n't show himself without you .
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment .
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that .
nothing , nothing .
havana .
yeah .
on the contrary . it is more deeply stirring ... to my blood ... ... than any imagining could possibly have been ...
in the coffin , my dear . where else ... ?
and linda ...
you could have called me --
what 's the matter with you ... ? ! what kind of person are you ... ? !
what a beautiful day .
i ca n't understand it ! where is he ? i mean , he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree , and now he decides to pull a disappearing act ?
hang on hang on , sorry , but like , who are you ?
do n't mention it .
benjamin -- i want you to know i 'm available to you . if you wo n't sleep with me this time --
you 've already stolen my heart , as well as another more prominent organ , south of the equator ...
pleasure to meet you , patrick .
chaos . transport paralysis . crop failure . economic disaster . frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale . you 've seen a few samples ...
edmunds ?
no , it 's the whole idea behind it . how did they get this place ?
yeah , but we made that deal while wes was still alive . he 's gone . time for a new deal .
i never met such a person . not a spark of romance or sentiment or ? or human kindness in your whole body .
what gentleman , maria ?
no .
ok .
come on . try .
sir , i --
who are you trying to convince ?
the woman 's health is at stake .
grave robbers ?
a lot of people . teachers . younger kids . it 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason . but that 's ok ... because i know i deserve it .
that was a nice little stunt you pulled , buzzing the base .
they 'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye ... people watching would spit at them .
but why , son of malkovich ?
i was thinking -- what about you and ... `` simone '' moving back in with me and lainey ?
what 's that ?

i was looking for the lieutenant singh .
i feel like i do .
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most !
just what i had in mind . everything dead on earth except us . a chance for mother nature to start again . plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man . sorry hon , this is for science . behold the dawn of a new age .
she 's not a psychic . just a very enlightened spirit .
what do you mean ?
what the fuck can i say ? i 'm serious , man . what the fuck can i say ? thank you ... thank you ... thank you .
all right then , we 'll use your plan .
must have been ? used to live ? i do live here .
wait a second ... what time is it ?
antonia ?
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
like what ?
i figured , whenever you decided to go , you 'd be all set .
no it wo n't . you just do n't know shit about statistics .
yeah , and the freeway 's well-lighted , is n't it , mitch ?
up you go . right now .
you must think the whole world is queer . well it 's not . war sure is n't .
our semi-conductors are down !
yes please !
jesus ...
gee..twenty five dollars for something i made !
i 'm sorry .
it was at that .
you better .
cause i do n't want to walk around with my head all nappy , looking like --
do n't worry about it , dick . barry 's an asshole .
my husband ... you know him .
will it ?
impossible . put it on again .
no .
you 're wasting your time , frost . far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words . whatever secrets they hold have been lost .
oh , thank you . thank you !
it 's possible . please do n't ask me any more questions now . just wait , wait for me . i 'll be back . i need you here .
cuervo jones ' right-hand man . one tough hombre . you do n't understand , snake . cuervo jones wants to unify the island . we 're on the move , man . big time .
do n't be silly - ? you 're going to make summer better for them ...
i do n't think so .
it sure is a beautiful old hotel .
say hello to mrs. robinson , benjamin .
in how long ? a week ?
do n't fuck with me , beth .
you did n't ? -- i guess i forgot to tell you --
please ...
yet can not love nor write it .
show ...
alright ?
no ... no ... we 'd love to hear it . would n't we ?
i 'm hungry . you 've upset my whole day . i have n't eaten .
me !
because i already tried once .
take them back , suzette .
romeo , come forth .
no , alex , we do n't really love you .
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went ?
you know , a good cop wo n't let you know he knows you 're fulla shit .
you 're not really serious about this , are you ?
no !
okay . why do n't you go out there . we 'll check in with you later .
pretend you 're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims .
uh , yeah . we 're old friend*
what are you talking about ?
let it go , do n't waste your time .
you guys are my parents .
the t-1000 has the same files that i do . it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson 's house .
no kidding ?
could this be that boy ?
you would .
i 'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in genoa and wind up here . if you do n't know about 'em , who does ?
join my quest .
she could 've been a nurse .
i sent andy out on murder missions . for god 's sake -- it 's the boston strangler , alber desalvo . he used their own stockings to strangle them . tied in a bow-knot .
guess who ?
what happened ?
why do n't you shoot off the lock ?
good .
oh , no .
in the spring when he melts !
probably .
i heard something .
just one . dostoevsky . the idiot . three zlotys .
i thought the gloves were off .
i 'll look around and catch up later .
he was not black ! he was ... tan ! weathered !
hell , you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all .
i do n't think i should have opened my big mouth . sorry , ho-jon .
well , everything 's set . creating quite a furor , too . great stunt king 's going to pull .
stupid , man . it 's universally stupid .
they forced me to marry !
you investigating those murders out at the lake ?
i know this may seem like a strange question , but can i ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything , i know you 're a professional , but just for me , i was just wondering .
she loved me . she wanted to see me every night .
you analyze everything out of existence . you analyze me out of existence . i wo n't let you . love is not so simple . ninotchka , ninotchka , why do doves bill and coo ? why do snails , coldest of all creatures , circle interminably around each other ? why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates ? why do flowers open their petals ? oh , ninotchka , ninotchka , surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion ... a general warmth in the palms of your hands ... a strange heaviness in your limbs ... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing , more exalting , than thirst ?
oh , i 'm sorry .
because i do n't want to .
you heard me that time .
not bad . i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me .
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now . so you care about what you 're thought of in america . and in america , at this moment in time , hezbollah does not have a face . that 's why .
does that scare you ?
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
yes . sorry .
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away ?
i do n't know . everything 's jumbled -- so you 're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks .
oh , what do you do with that ?
sir :
i think i 'll ride along with the lady here . just take a look at this farmland before i come into silverado . see what makes a trip this hard worth taking . i 'll see you around .
... take a good look , chief , do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember ?
git to work !
no , for you ! how old are you , billy ?
mom says to clean up the pool .
what ?
i do n't know if i want to .
if i find anything i 'll call you .
observe .
i have no doubt of that . i 'll come by in the morning and we 'll arrange it . goodnight , mrs. watchit .
there 's nothing to expose .
what is it ?
only when i 'm awake ... you busy after work ?
aye , sir .
now let 's get down to business . kuato wants what 's in quaid 's head . and he might be able to get it , cause they say he 's psychic . now i have a little plan to keep this from happening . -- do you think you can play along ?
three million ?
er , bad breath , colourful language and a feather duster ! . . . what do you think they will be armed with ? guns , you tit !
be patient , that 's all . take an interest in your treatment and do n't dwell on your resentments . you 'll be yourself again , i assure you .
rrgh mmffpprr brghuh ! !
there it is ... thursday ... you ca n't rip it out of the week ... .
oh , well thanks a fucking bunch .
what gaps ?
we must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans ' hospital .
so , what are you seeing ?
and what a lovely name . las vegas ...
you 're sweet , but the only thing that you can do for me is to go .
then what ? when you get through with blue and yellow , then what ?
i got it , woody !
you want to get out of here ?
ya know what , fred ?
well , most people are stupid . you want to talk about odds ? one day i 'll tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons . you wan na talk about odds ?
hey .
shhhhhh . now i have your disease .
hello , leon !
think you can do it ?
i was just thinking about my mom . she would n't leave him . i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . i mean it was dark outside and in . but we never talked about it .
dropped it .
polish ?
you need a new car anyway .
yeah ? well i do n't like to talk about my past .
most certainly . arrange it .
what ? !
that little job cost me a hundred dollars ... did n't even get to keep the fish .
that 's funny . i thought all along -- gee -- i -- i 'm glad to see you . i *thought* of you -- i mean -- i wanted to talk to someone and -- well -- -- mr. lincoln has n't much to say -- saunders -- i 'm not fit to sit up in the senate -- have n't you heard ? -- i robbed boys of their pennies and dimes !
i 'm not in this 'cause it 's fun . i 'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either ... i do it 'cause it works- ...
fuck your curfew . most sixth graders can stay out later than you .
snoop , if you do n't know where glenn is ...
originals ?
am i ?
speak english .
then i 'm afraid i do n't understand .
he 's just as crooked as the next guy . you 'd think he 'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars .
there were n't any wires . i looked .
i really think you need to calm down now , okay ?
kate . thank god you 're there . i need help .
well , you 're not exactly an expert witness , but what makes you so sure ?
how many pupils do you have ?
you --
where were you the day he died ?
do n't touch me ! i 'm < u > allergic < /u > to you !
i was never much of a sweater . you know that .
in the jail cell is a spiral staircase . it leads to the surface . take it all the way up .
forget about him .
call it an expression of trust .
i breached protocol . i broke contact with the s.a.c . i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
sure . it 's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago . the fault line itself is unstable and always shifting , which is the reason you get earthquakes in the california area from time to time .
they 're all dead .
do you remember what triggered it all ?
thanks .
aaron should be hearing this so i have an extra witness .
he 'd been shot . i did n't know that . he just crawled into the back seat , said `` west 45th street '' and conked out .
can i ask you a question ? people always say , you got ta get good with jesus , if you want not to go to hell . that you say sorry for all you done and ... and jesus would let you go on to heaven .
hostages ?
go sit over in that chair .
that 's the whole works , right up to date .
do n't you think , do you still think it 's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now ?
maybe it 's time for a vacation .
is it funny that i 'm in love with you ?
i think he will .
fumes build up in the fuel tanks . you can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet . planes use o-rings ... which freeze in tap water . planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all .
no way . no way .
excuse my presumption , but i do not agree . as a teacher on a training mission , i am content to command a starship . if we are to go on actual duty , it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command .
you have a lot of brothers and sisters ?
i do n't want it to taste different . i do n't know why i bother . is that enough for you ? hey !
it would seem so , master
and your new apartment ?
let me know when you do , all right ?
you 're not looking for the statue of liberty at all .
yeah .
i do n't know -- maybe -- i do n't think so .
quell ?
the hell you will . you know too much about me as it is ... now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on betazed .
shhh ! do n't make him feel worse .
i wonder how long it takes to get someone you 're stuck on out of your system ? if they 'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
-- i 'm sure --
you see : we 've got to change that name .
who are you ?
... and fangs ... and you 're like `` i do n't know what to do . how do i kill this bunny ? `` ...
promise ... please do n't thx leaves the room .
what was she like ?
no , will , this is n't the alcohol talking . it 's the truth .
natural to the line of work they was in .
no . you killed her . manager remembers you going into her room . your fingerprints were found all over the place .
i 'd like to do your hair sometime .
with the paper to prove it .
that much , huh ?
mmmmmmmmmm ! mmmmmmmmmmmm !
eddie ?
i 'm not hungry .
mary clarence , could you ? mary lazarus , you 're terrific , but ... could you help us ?
is it fur ?
lawyers . i do n't know , ellie -- firing me is going to be very tough on you . it 's going to be hard to get over . there will be therapy bills for you .
well , we ca n't force her . it 's her decision .

not no more .
i told you , time has no meaning here . if you leave , you can go anywhere , any time .
so did you
i ... i just need to know what state you 're in so i know ... how to talk to you ... how to act ...
hey , what 's up .
you and me , roy . what a team we 'll make . we think alike ; we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . you wo n't regret this , roy .

you killed domini , did n't you , witch ? ?
i hate being lectured .
you better get over to al 's . now .
good job , not pretty , but good .
at any rate , dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out , and i said , `` what for ? '' whatever the hell he 's doing , even if it 's a completely wasteful escapade , it 's entirely his business . simple as that ...
not now . she 's emotional . her mother dies today . scene forty-two of `` good for nothing '' . it 's not a good time .
the coward !
where抯 your wallet ? have you got a wallet ?
i love you , alex . i never wanted to leave . you know that , do n't you ?
no , i mean doing it at my house .
yeah . bye .
well , are you gon na answer me ? what 'd you come here for ?
duck fuckers ?
god damn it , i knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit .
seems too coincidental that way .
did n't i ? i thought i did . i 'm sure i did .
she 's here . she 's just ... hold on a second .
what 's in there ?
picking up velocity .
gale , i do n't know what i 'm doing from one moment to the next . i 'm just taking it as it comes .
do n't be ridiculous .
whatever you touched , that 's good now .
he suggested i ask you .
i do n't follow you .
it got him ... .
and you 're gon na do just that . but i 'll tell you what to feed the pig . you alright with this ?
what 's wrong with your back ?
one .
hey , i heard you went to summer school ?
oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions . bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon , but he was n't in . apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind .
do n't throw that away . i had that once with a guy . but i threw it away for a cheap thrill .
did mr. doyle think i stole this case .
i 'm right ?
ow !
i do n't give a shit . that guy 's got no right .
you bitch !
are you alright ?
oh . ah ... recently . all the kids drink it .
thirty thousand dollars reward . in the whereabouts of il dottore fanelli , or the apprehension of his ...
break it .
wrong .
i admire your strength .
you saying we go up there and kill everyone ?
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information .
hey look-
on the contrary , it matters a great deal . we 're engaged in immensely important research here . i 'm a revolutionary too , you know -- but a much more pragmatic one .
i said when i think about you , i get wet .
not in years .
i guess you knew that , anyway .
it 's the first time i 've had to chance to tell the story . i never mentioned it to anybody .
that 's not ... it 's not like that .
sheriff -- hi -- this is sergeant -- this is priscilla worth .
do n't be silly . what are you sorry about ?
oh --
pardon me ?
i love you , too .
sure . did n't i ever tell you french toast was my specialty ? i 'll bet i never told you that . now then , the first thing we need is ... ... eggs ! right ?
ah .
did as of last week .
he wo n't steal . i 'm tellin ' you he 's a pretty good ol ' boy . keeps to himself .
no , not like me .
she 's really a fox , is n't she ?
i ca n't . i got to take farrah to satan 's place down in costa mesa .
veronica . finally . got a paper of kurt kelly 's . i need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in kurt 's handwriting and we 'll slip it into martha dumptruck 's lunch tray .
can we have a hot dog , please , medium rare , and a cup of joe ?
dick low 's a killer too .
you may call me leia .
i 'm clayton .
no .
i gather you 're a decorator .
well sir , perhaps i should explain ...
pretty vile . see this : the s and the t , do you see ? -- fine , vulnerable -- that 's pain , that 's secret pain .
why do n't you guys grab some dinner at the thai place ? i 'll meet you there as soon as i can .
no comment .

doc , go get frank and put him on the phone .
i 'm not crying .
what hump ?
ben says he and elaine are getting married .
did you ever see francis-8 ?
i blast the lead car into oblivion ...
i know who y6u are . you 're dorothy boyd . you 're in ... wait ... you 're in accounts . you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille 0 neal 's body .
a.p.b ... . he is n't breaking any law . he 's a grown man ... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that 's what he wants to do .
what 's going on ? !
it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being .
order , eh -- who does he think he is ?
i would n't have any reason to hurt her . she was always on the up and up with me . but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he did n't , so he put the finger on me .
what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people . she 's young , she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her . its creative , but in her case it 's too creative .
just get me a coke and do n't argue with me , ok ?
yeah , and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are , what 's going on inside their heads . sometimes you can hear it , like a buzzing , the things that happen in their heads . and you wonder : does anybody ever love anybody , really ?
what-what ? where you been the last four five years ? outer space ?
oh , is he bald and amorphous ?
they 'll all be fine . who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert ?
somewheres . i do n't know yet .
hello ?
looking for me ?
why did n't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol ?
could you be more specific ?
christ , why did n't you say anything about this when they first arrived ? you could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of american pilots !
an oldsmobile silhouette .
you got ta go back there and talk to that guy .
do as i say . let go !
well , as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment , i 'll be sound as a pound .
on a purely scientific basis .
what do you mean by that ?
alright , i gave him the case ? .. so the case is closed , so what ?
wow . maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles .
hi suze .
no . course not .
this is n't meant --
w-well , please be candid . i , i-i do n't want you to feel bad .
i thought only hookers drank those things .
yeah , it 's true . you do look like a boxer . john garfield , in body and soul . exactly john garfield anyone told you that father ?
how you plan to do that ?
what i < u > found < /u > your was your granddaughter !
c'mon .

i have already heard about this cafe , and also about mr. rick himself .
< i > new york times < /i > ... ?
san is an honorable title .
yeah , they were sluts . huh huh huh .
merry christmas .
what do you do about what ?
why did you do it ?
you think god forgives people like that ? you think god forgives people like me ?
what 's the rush ?
full impulse .
no . i was in the shower .
yes , your eminence . the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
are you always sucha good judge of character ?
then what the hell are you talking about ?
so you knew this young man before ?
no , sir ! you 'll flood the whole compartment ... !
how often is that ?
just get the fuck outta here .
what 's wrong ?
so they say .
what ?
okay , and ... and ...
this is a cinch . i look up , i look down . i look up --
i will not allow it . i will not !
try to !
you got ta earn trust .
it might not be far , but it 's another galaxy . black is black and white is white , and never the twain shall meet .
it 's hard to understand because it says in addition to but i ca n't exactly understand in addition to what because there 's actually nothing to add it too ...
if you ca n't deal with him on that basis , you better get a new counselor .
captain , i do n't know how much longer i can hold her together !
i 'm a gambler -- i 'm running at large like a happy pig , devouring anything of life that pleases me , i really belong in jail
that 'd be a crime -- after all this work -- getting it buried in this deficiency bill as nice as you please -- approved -- all ready to roll --
good night .
i would like to watch television .
and people are actually fooled by that ?
hey junebug , when all this is over we should get the band back together again .
nice neighborhood .
i see ...
there 's an old cemetery on this road . i 've been there before .
well , i do n't know , i may be doing some traveling this summer . i do n't know how much i 'll be around ... but i 'll give you a call sometime .
paul , you know who this is ?
no ?
i do n't care about the danger , father . i just want to be good . i want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness .
not a whole lot , bob .
feeling better ?
we would be caught dead with men . those rough , hairy beasts with eight hands - they all want just one thing from a girl .
casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him ... and there was n't a thing that we could do about it .
you do n't look alright .
how many men have we seen die ?
come on .
noooo . free snort . that 's it .
go on , take it . then you ca n't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid .
jim west .
your princess is really a winning creature . a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .
that 's all over as far as i 'm concerned , emmett . i 'm satisfied .
what if we go out there , you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open .
i enjoy it . does that make me some kind of pervert ? just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
sure ...
i 'm not sleepy anymore . let 's drive for a little while longer .
he has his wife 's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there .
getting late . we better get back .
why not ?
all your other fluzzies ?
the videos .
yeah , you did that too . you earned what you got ; do n't shit on it , that 's all i 'm saying .
i 'm telling you so when you look back on this moment , you can think ... there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever ... when i could have easily helped him .
i 'm tellin ' ya , i 'm giving you all i know .
radio said negative five .
i heard somebody been haulin ' wets on this road .
no jean , no money !
no stop where he 's all besieged .
am i going ? am i going to england ? i 've thought about this quite a bit , and i 've realised what i probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what i wan na do with my life , do all the stuff that i 've been avoiding in a big way . i mean , diane and i can wait for each other , right ? what 's she gon na ... she 's gon na run off with some english guy ? there 's no way .
somebody 's got to help us !
i know what you mean . after a while they all look the same .
i lost sight of everything . forgot who my friends were .

yeah . we were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said , `` ball . ''
i said you are fine , he should leave you the hell alone .
well i heard differently .
look , ca n't you see that , what i 'm talking about ?
there 's no time for this bullshit ...
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human . if it does n't look human , it 's a reptile or a big insect or something , having human values , human understanding .
mr. san pedro sula 's authorized to carry a .45 .
no .

the night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me , to help me -- i turned you away .
i 'm not finding fault . it 's a good idea , good for you , good for the town . real modern too .

it 's griffin .
i do n't know what i 'd do if i lost you .
that 's what he was saying about you .
billy . this is dr. alvarez . she would like to talk to you .

why not ? i must have subjects . it 's the only way i can teach . it 's the only way you can learn . the stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as gray . we can do our own dirty work -- and we must .
maybe , who knows .
it could be a fire . this is malibu .

so you 're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter .
well . i 'm not going to let that stop me .
confirmed , captain !
yes , but ... i 'm just something you 're imagining . what can i do ? i 'm in your head , too .

miss darrow ... i 've been thinking . i would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father . it 's a great shame he was n't able to join us on this adventure . truly a wonderful man .

buddy-boy , why did n't you say so ? you got yourself a little playmate , huh ?
her brother .
i think the worst is over .

yeah , well i do n't think you 're very grateful . a lot of people in your position would say & quot ; thank you & quot ; .
i understand you perfectly .
indeed you must , baron -- you must . humm -- humm , but you must go to jail , baron , you 're a thief .
you did n't tell me you owned a saloon .
i ca n't wait to hear your opening argument . `` ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... the defense will prove that jason voorhees did not kill all of these people . they , in fact , committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard ... ''
are you ... okay ?
[ daniel what ? ]
sure , king .
and are the police aware you dated the victim ?

it 's mr. buddy felton ?
it 's a big and busy funeral home .
does that look to you like about a '77 ford , wendell ?
pornos .
it seems your department does n't believe out new unit is to the public benefit .
malaysia 's tanking . we 're meeting in ten in operations .
you may deny the devil , toddy , but you 'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead .

how do you feel , dell ?
i think we said everything we needed to say . maybe it 's time to say things to someone else ? someone close to you ?
well , we will accept these charming little gifts . when we see them . meanwhile , please , take your pick of a horse .
twice a year .
did you read them ?
your director and your co-star of your current movie . do n't dish if you ca n't take it , sally .

well , i do n't understand . what did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or ... or ... a list ?
there ... ya happy ?
i guess so .

wait ! hold it - it 's on . let 's go .
i do have a tendency to use that word too much .
some remarkable events have happened in birmingham and atlanta . do you know what i 'm talking about ?
you remember the '99 chrysler lebaron ? it 's the exact height of the front fender . looked right instead of left .
that creature sure must have considered it important ... using his last strength to draw it ...
you mean about the andrews ' kid ?
guilty thoughts . see what happens when you cheat on me , even in your mind ?
sure , dave , what 's up ?
i 'm miss wilson - mrs. schuyler 's social secretary .
wide awake . i do n't remember ever feelin ' this awake . everything looks different . you know what i mean . i know you know what i mean . everything looks new . do you feel like that ? like you 've got something to look forward to ?
then , that being so , why is today special ? why have you come back to see me ? is it that new file they gave you ?
like normal folks .
dixie mccoy did n't .
very well .
karl , i ai n't tryin ' to say nothin ' bad about you , but why do n't you stop doyle when he gets that away ? you 're older than him . you 're strong , too . my daddy would n't let him do that to me and mama .
well , that will have them rolling in the aisles .
i think we 're about half way .
fine with fucking me , we got work to do . i do n't care what it takes , we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gon na pay us a great deal of money when we do . i do n't know about the rest of you guys , but i 'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass . i do n't mean that in , like , a literal way ...
amidships starboard at the beam . just under the waterline . i do n't think it 's a problem .
i know what i have to know .
< u > really < /u > ? would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney 's working hypothesis ?
why do n't you try letting her in , steve ? i mean shenge .
around here .
glenmorangie is very good .
i swear , sidney , i ca n't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you ...
would you come in here , please ?
ayuh -- it 's a mess , all right .
if she looked like thea , she must have been beautiful .
you do n't understand .
okay , i 'm closing up . everybody relax .
explain to me again why we did n't do this in des moines in an air conditioned office ?
... really ? that 's nice ... are you lying ?
she ca n't help it .
allie ... he wants to tell me . i had a roll of film . his face was on it . he knew that -- and he let me keep .
just find her , man . she 's my daughter , she 's my sister , she 's my mother , she 's some little brat i stood in line with at taco bell last week . do whatever you want with my words . and my money .
i just pulled and it - it came off .
i do n't know . it probably would 've been the same .
luke blew it up . give credit where it 's due .
my god , an actual operating 8-track .
well it seems like a long time -- but it was n't really . it 's rather hard to explain .
forget about it . we 'll make our new movie , and you 'll be a star again .
kathy , please . you 're going to wear a hole in the carpet .
just put it in your purse .
it 's -- he 's got some kind of conspiracy theory . he thinks someone 's . . . i do n't know , stalking us .
that 's the first time i ever saw him kiss a man , like a dad , was n't that just ... thrilling ? i mean , he must have been needing that .
ah , c'mere . i want to show you something .
i thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the rtd of -
the mud carriers .
then i 'll transpose .
what about rule number three : do n't get involved with dispatchers named love .
maude ?
yes ... leaving immediately .
m'hm .
what 's the matter ?
'really a lot appreciate it ... '
of course it 's unfair ! we 're women . our choices are never easy .
i ai n't a-stayin ' . i need to ast you fer a favor .
sidney : i do n't understand him . we know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience . to witness the act . we know he thinks the act is making him into something different . his 'becoming ' ... but i do n't know what it is he thinks he 's becoming . the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors . that 's what 's missing for me . why the mirrors ?
maybe , maybe not . got him in the gut , i think .
good evening . did you have a pleasant day today ?
you 're right . you 're right . of course , one does n't want to boast . it 's a classic case of technology in search of an artist . that 's all you 've been waiting for , an artist with integrity , with a vision , who can see .
no . no , i 've heard bupkis . jack , i 'll talk to you later . call me when you get something i can use . smut 's from hunger . for sad sacks who ca n't get their ashes hauled
now hurry , dinner 's almost ready . your father says he 's starving .
but why ? do n't you understand what keating is saying ? do n't you want to do something about it ?
it 's nothing .
sophy ? are you okay ?
look , frankie . you and jack been playing here , a long time .
i should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five .
look at the size of it !
a muslim must be strikingly upright . outstanding . so those in the darkness can see the power of the light .
no ... she 's not ...
they 're methodical . they 're nothing if they 're not that .
what the fuck ?
resentful .
yes . yes . absolutely .
shut up .
i always knew that you were special .
gee -- that fair --
some gave me a dress . you know what 's great ? what i 'm learning ? you win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground . everywhere i go , we 're in the right . i like that .
ever even been < u > in < /u > one ?
what about `` 60 minutes . ''
you know my work ?
what the hell 's there ?
issue the toilet paper tear as a ...
do you want to ?
is he black ?
i do n't know . i would 've done something . this is kind of hypothetical , is n't it ? this place is so stupid . i ca n't believe we 're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism . with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh ...
hello again .
why would harry go back to using a code ?
i know this truck . belongs to a feller named moss .
i could n't tell her ... it 's , it 's too major ... jesus , i 'm starting to believe in god and what 's worse i think i like the guy . the lightning bolt was just a test , right ? wendy and i -- we 're meant to be . i 'm right , right ? i have to see her ...
but sir , most of the people we are putting into the `` park '' are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers . they are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess .
i do n't know what went wrong last night , but this department could 've lost one detective and our only explosives expert .
slow down .
no , not anymore . it 's too ... it 's too far .
`` goodness , gracious , great balls of fire . '' to the killer . jerry lee lewis .
kevin ... you 're not your dad . the two of us , we 're not your parents .
i know what it is . he wo n't find me again .

what 'd you want me to do ? back down ? he called me a bitch . we kept our rep .
yeah .
i do n't know . do i ?
i would n't live in it as a ghost . now watch . . . right on the second floor there .
... so you made another deal ?
but kader told me that you were n't in favor of the strike .
you always do this to me .
look - this pose is all wrong !
then what ?
oh , it 's all my damn business now , lamar . investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction ... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy . he 's my suspect .
it does n't look all that different .
other than , he抯 shagging your exgirlfriend ?
is n't that weird ? i mean , i dated a little bit after my divorce , for four or five years . six years . i know when my son was younger ... maybe when he was ten or eleven even , he 'd run up and wrap his arms around me .
sure . we would n't ask you to do anything we would n't do . now give me your hand ... that 's it ...
i do n't care what she is . she 's an institution , that 's the problem . she 's lazy .
yeah . sister mary pat was discussing it . you know she thinks it 's a sin .
did i say i wanted a cheap room to live in -- when i came here did i ask for a cheap room ? did i ?
do n't play innocent with me , thelma . you know perfectly well what 's going on .
well , we all have a degree of narcissism , sally , but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed .
you know your father enjoys his company .
we lost him .
todd , what 's the matter ?
here is now there . there is here .
she said that ? reverend mother ?
yes it is .
four minutes past . please come .
good thing one of us was prepared .
peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo , too ... .

what 's that look like to you , rico ?
mickey told him to call . 'he 's some very hotshot surgeon at mass . commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye . you meet him at the hospital . '
the wrong kind ! there is n't any wrong or right kind . opera is opera !
i dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater ; i dream in color , y'know ; he walked into the room i was in , right , right through the wall , like it was smoke or something , and just stared at me . sort of ... obscenely . then he walked out through the wall on the other side . like he 'd just come to check me out ...
what ? you do n't think i can have a normal life ?
you guys always look great .
we have hunted since childhood .
whoa ! heh heh . hey butt-head , this chick is pretty cool . she says there 's gon na be tons of sluts in las vegas ! heh heh heh .
you ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day ?
well , i do n't know . no , i do n't know , daddy , i think the rain has obscured it .
the word for those things is croissants .
what do you think ?
otherwise you 'd be fighting me off .
now this might get a bit technical , but try and stay with me . using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators , called the internet , i can access surveillance maps , villian biographical information , and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter .
murder , honey .
well -- nice to know life exists outside the office .
in firing position . torpedo armed .
yeah , we 're just screwing around . like mohammed said . ca n't take a joke , man ? hey , i hope you got a permit for that , mama !
i must have miscalculated . how . . .
information like that is very expensive and you do n't have the balls to pay the price .
mr. carter , i appreciate your desire to show me a good time , but that is not the reason i am here .
far from it .
what did you say ? what did you do ?
you did n't kiss anyone else 's knees , did you ?
and i really wanted some ice cream too .
we do n't have anything straightened out . you 're uptight about something ... what 's wrong ?
just the damn cable tv company . you know how they are . did you hear about dottie hinkle ?
take care ? where the hell are you going --
wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems ... !
he 's moving to the big city next week . he wants to be a metal singer .
dead or alive ?
reliant in our section this quadrant , sir , and slowing --
see what i mean ?
what do you know of my husband ?
i know . oh , i know . i 've been calling all morning . oh , you have no idea . miss daniels , they 're so difficult to get , really they are . we get them from india , you know , when they 're just little chicks , and then we have to ...
they would have killed you too .
we do n't have time !
he went down to the lobby for a minute . he should be right back . would you like come in ?
lest we forget how cruel you are .
and i you . i think i 've heard about you , mr. felson . you play pocket billiards , do n't you ?

yeah , what 'd he have to say ?
four thirty-seven ? that is n't where gerry g ... ?
oh , that . that ai n't nothin ' to be afraid of , ma'am . just ol chief bromden . that 's all ...
what do you want ?
i 'd like to sit for you again . but only if you ease up on the locker room talk . okay ?
and the way you 're looking at me , is that the way you look at a man you 've just beaten ? as if you 'd just taken his money , and now all you want is ... his pride ?
oh , christ ... ah , yeah ... you want to know why mom 's not here , right ?
hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one . why do i suddenly feel like snow white ?
i do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots .
no ! i keep seeing him staring out his window . watching me .
where from ?
she jumped out of the window .
it 's possible . just negotiate .
sixpack ?
those are two different kinds of trust . thank you for your time . i hope we can do business .
city hall ?
we 've done cranial scans , and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber . i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence . the way they can work together as a team .
heard on the radio how doctors is usin ' leeches again , just in old times . you know , when even barbers used 'em ?
we 're examined once a year . her pregnancy fell in between the doctor 's visits .
there 's no room .

sir , i ran the 220 in high school .
you mean like , < u > strip < /u > strip ?
okay , save your batteries !
you 're better when you take them .
but , here 's the thing . he 'll only talk to you . he does n't want you to ask him anything . and you should n't stare at him .
getting off please .
god , i really need to jump about a bit . how 's your film going ?
fuckin ' a right .
elementary physics ... a beam of energy can always be diverted ... ooh , my head are we there yet , mommy ?
four hundred bucks .
yes .
then stop acting like one . if you 're really in some kind of trouble , i 'd like to hear about it . otherwise , it 's late , i 'm tired and i 'm going home to bed .
is this part of the test ?
well , it 's a tricky turn .
we heard it the first time !
and we 're upset too .
can i get you something ?
ten seconds ... .
why , so you can go after him ?
ms. magnuson , is jimmy gardner with you ?
this is my business . mr. dickson 's been like a father to me . what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this ?
i 've got to write some of this down .
they sure knocked the stuffings out of you , did n't they ?
zee , i 'm pleased you came .
just play a part . a little acting .
no , 'fraid not .
keep what handy ?
how does that feel ?
what kind of things exactly ?
you 're getting too cool for me , j.d . i do n't know how to talk to you .
i said all that ?
kenny 'll come running back . this is just his way of pressuring you .
she did n't tell me .
no . now . you fucked him .
he married for love - that 's why he did everything . that 's why he went into politics . it seems we were n't enough . he wanted all the voters to love him , too . all he really wanted out of life was love . that 's charlie 's story - it 's the story of how he lost it . you see , he just did n't have any to give . he loved charlie kane , of course , very dearly - and his mother , i guess he always loved her . as for emily - well , all i can tell you is emily 's story as she told it to me , which probably is n't fair - there 's supposed to be two sides to every story - and i guess there are . i guess there 's more than two sides -
she 's on to him . you shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is , he kin run her crazy .
of course .
shit .
good morning , swana .
not enough against their shields .

i have n't had a chance to see him yet . i 'm going to take care of sleeping beauty .
i just want to see how much bullets it takes .
a girl needs protection .
no , not me .
is it time ? d'you have to leave for the funeral ?
sir , i still do n't think , uh , we can contain it anymore . there 's a cancer on the presidency . and it 's growing . with every day that ...
an accurate number would be difficult to gauge .
my twenty-five per cent . approximately fifteen hundred bucks .
if i was you , mr. mast , i 'd watch my language .
any vulnerability he senses , he 'll exploit .
what ?
bobo , no , i --
yah , it 's this vehicle i asked you about yesterday . i was just wondering -
i 'm certainly not .
all right , girls - from the top again .
peter , i 'm in no mood to hear childish prattle !

jesus .
your brother ...
oh , do you ?
i ca n't afford civility , sir . how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when you 've got me set up as an outsider ? even if i make it under these rules , i still lose , because there 'll always be a flag in my file -- `` yeah , she made it , but ... '' i mean , really -- why did n't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base ?
i 'm not on the phone to talk to you about that . well , i do n't know what to say , leon . when you gim me that ... when you hit me with that shit . i mean , what am i supposed to say ?

bullshit .
'uh , almost ' is not an answer . 'yes frank , it 's all done ' : that 's an answer .
yes , yes , i remember you .
where are we ?
alain is the only man i know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman .
i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours .
i do n't think so . you should know we 're going to fight you with every resource we have .
well , can i at least call you deer ? ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ! seriously , amy , the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma ' -- the great circle of life , death and rebirth .
the titan 's a fine ship , will . and she 's getting a captain worthy of her .
hey ! rule number one - never take off the mask ! y'hear me ! no matter what happens , never take off the mask !

steve ?
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and agent scully had n't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --

i admit , i know nothing of your culture .
listen ... thank you .
yeah .
doctor , this is sal talkin ' .
creasy . just call me creasy .
they 're framing me .
miss wollsten shares the room with you ?
i 'm sure you 'll be able to handle him .
it is n't done , gentlemen ! it is n't done , i say ! it is n't done !
i do n't like to lose , either .
but ... i did n't wish ... i did n't want him dead !
why is n't he in the general ward , then ?
you going to warn him ?
we might need some mo ' money behind this .
i 'm going to give it to you straight . there 's no point in beating around the bush . there were survivors . apparently , the fallout has created ... .a subspecies of mutants .
yes , jim .
well , i mean , business is okay , and lacrosse is awesome , but what am i gon na be , a pro lacrosse player ? i really have no idea .
i know you need to please lisa . an ass like that is hard to find . good bodyguards are even harder .
has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that ?
when you going to let me work with you ? why you always fucking with me ?
you sure you 're comfortable ?
she 's gon na kill scotty !
the dirty , stinking , rotten , sons of b 's ! ! they might have clobbered marge and the

it 's not done .
dude finlay ?
when ?
well , i kind of hate to point it out , but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation ... and as you know , we used up most of that time in harvesting .
you want to tell me what i 'm looking for ?
we have a visitor .
you overslept ?
well , put it down and come in !
dad , i love him .
where you going ?
do n't get mad , louise , but where are we going ?
i remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour .
... freddie ! what 's the matter ? you 've been like this all evening .
if you were my boyfriend , i 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail ten-thousand miles away .
need help ?
puff , put the gun down .
yeah . i 've stolen two cars before . one jaguar . and one trans-am . with t- tops . that trans-am was fun to drive .
we took a walk three days ago .
what 's the word on the chairs ?
how can i let you leave ; how can i let you take my children away ? do n't you know me ? you understand , it 's an impossibility . i would never let it happen ; no , never , not if it took all my strength , all my cunning . but in time , soon , you 'll feel differently . you see , you 'll be happy that i stopped you . i know you . you 'll forget about this ; you 'll forget about the baby we lost ... and we 'll go on , you and i .
salesmen and cops are the ones . if you 'd ever waitressed , honey , you 'd know .
sonny , would you please just tell them ... please ...
how 'd you manage that , then .
i mean it , grace . i 'm getting out of here , and i want to take you with me .

inga , wake up !
the dynamite ...

what makes you think he would write a show about the mau-mau 's .
can anyone else see him ?
of course . there is one more thing , mrs. treborn . and i feel bad for mentioning it ...
we 're gon na operate together .
well -- i was prepared for worse , but it was n't so bad . we were sitting at the bar , talking about blackjack . you seemed just fine , a little drunker than usual , but nothing really strange , but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then , wham , you swung you arm at me , and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress . you smashed everything on her tray , it was a real mess . you kept yelling and yelling .
where 'd they get you ?
closed .
have patience !
no , but something 's gon na blow in this town . i can feel it .
that would be impossible .

we 'll have to make them come to us , wo n't we ? and since there are two of them , we 're going to set two plans in motion . first : we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night .
listen .
you 're late , we 're all backed up and you 're supposed to go to buffums .
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
not good enough , man . they planted something inside me . i 'm on my own countdown .
do you like it when scraps sleeps on his back , jimmy ?
i 'm not stupid.. i know how this is supposed , to work .
both .
this is serious . nobody can know . ah , i 've returned from the future . i traveled back here 25 years .
a man does n't always mean the things he says .
yes , they were .
yeah . but get outta here . he 's comin ' back .
why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
i do n't know , but i 'm starving .
hmm ?

there 's no disease , i can tell you .
it 's your play .
i want my fucking money --
guess that 'd be me . again .
never , why do you ask ?
yes , i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables . i 'm afraid that they were n't very encouraging , but they said they 'd bring it up at their next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .
do n't worry , eddie , no one knows i 'm here .
have you tried walla walla ? kokomo 's very nice this time of year .
i heard already .

i do n't think so .. he said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
that day in brooklyn was the last day i remember really having a great time .
do n't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing ?
if you can , please call me . please . i have to go now ... goodnight .
god blew up the hindenburg . he 'll blow me up , that 's what she said ...
hey fuck you don watch it now .

no , no way , i could n't take that ...
it 's only a tale .
i do n't know ... to grow , to go out . whatever you want .
nope , there ! that 's one .
i have to go face to face .
i was in prison for twenty-eight years .
dr. evil ? i thought i put him in jail for good .
what ! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story ? not so you could notice it ! now , look , i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me .
... who is this ?
what about marla ?
all dead except one , sir .
um -- kay ?
for my sins . are you settling in alright ?
i need to find this technician , or anyone else who knows about project manticore . they would 've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work ... if i can track down one of them .
denver got very silent about a day ago . san diego 's got a fever for cush . this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft . people get crazy . and san diego , you should know , is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty . signing bonus of eight . million .
not much chance of that . jaeger 's an idiot .
say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables .
i do n't even know a jew who 'd have the balls to say that . so let 's get this straight . you never ever tip ?
open up !
the old ones were much spookier . they had castles , full moons ...
droppen sie dead ! raus mit dem ofen . los ! los !
the receptionist said you called earlier about something .
what did he do ?
`` this is the story of jimmy bones/black as night and hard as stones/gold plated deuce , like the king of siam/got his switchblade loose , and a diamond on his hand ... '' there 's the switchblade and there 's the diamond . do n't know where the deuce is parked .
let me ask you that again . this time , look around and consider your options .
i 've got something important to do . i ca n't leave .
i did n't mean -
move on . right . that 's what i 'm going to do . in a few months , boom , i 'll be fine , i 'll just grow a new heart .
you ca n't talk or do anything . you really feel ... you know ... i 'm just sort of coming out of it now .
uh-huh ...
it 's your castle , man .
do you ever regret not having a family ?
the spork . i get it . you 're very clever .
not .
hey ...
they 've all stopped at the same time .
we 'll beam aboard and stop it --
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson . i 'd forget it if i were you .
sell it all . what the hell , so i 'll only make ten million .
-- trucking ai n't the easiest life in the world . i mean , you ca n't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit do n't get a gold watch when you hang it all up . but i like keeping on the move . you know ?
tonight .
i 'm leaving in the morning .
i hope the block is still standing .
... so what would we claim ? he stabbed duane lindeman in self-defense ?
who told you ... ?
i 'm sorry . look -- there 's a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
haddonfield . it 's a four hour drive . you can reach me through the local police . if you did n't find him in four hours , i 'm sure i will .
i think i 'm very lucky . you do n't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it .
you said he was no possible connection with tom . the page girl told you that , not tom .
is that nietzsche ?
burbage has my keeping but you have my heart .
you better stop running from that girl .
vilyum , i am necdit yesil .

that 's okay .
what is that ? what are you doing with your hands ? talk to me , you 're talking like that girl sheila .
yes , sir .
you 're the one who said that boneyard 's the only way we 're getting out of here . we 're gon na join all the rest of 'em soon enough . jangle leg , biscuit , goldmouth , poker face , cookie , radio -- yes sir , pick a plot and start digging ...

flesh wound . no big deal .

what 's the matter with it ?
you two have some sick sex thing ?
tough guy , huh ? are you going to be all right on your own ?
listen to me --
what the hell did you do that for ? what are you doing here ?
was there any trigger event ? a trauma , shock or ... you have n't shown him any of the films you make , have you ? the horror stuff ?
i could tell you that , halberstam , but then i 'd have to kill you .
certainly .
i 'd rather talk about number two .
yeah , we were just standing there . you said something about your shoulder hurting , then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes .
i 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement .
you come to the right place .
it 's over . time of death was 4:42. jag 's been notified and i called the senator myself . my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable ... you two had no culpability in the matter .
what ? ? ?
ohhhh --
excuse me , i hope i am not a disturbance , don corleone .
not usually . i mean , honestly , i have n't known many guys that could think straight with an erection , so i feel i 'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes .
it 's personal . we 'll hook up at billy-boy 's pad in an hour . see ya then .
hey , guys !
i wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority .

247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor , if ya think about it .
threw a turbine blade .
i wish there was some way i could ... just ... pay the fine and go home .
i 'd take her , but then who would stay here ?
she told me not to talk to you .
... .what ... ?
yeah ... look , thanks for talking . i 'm sorry i woke you up .
i guess so .
ok. this is what you get when you 're a pervert -- you said you 'd help someone out and you did n't so we 're just getting some money for her and that 's that .
where are you going ?
blow it up ?
mom and dad wo n't be back until sunday night . it 's halloween carnival . we should throw a party . we could totally get away with it .
i may have seen her on campus .
you need to make these your primary `` action items . ''
that 's good . you ca n't be subtle in this town .
someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform .
oh really ? well , i 'll just let you get back to little ms. hot panties .

you 're not playing by the rules ben . do n't you want her to live ?
wh ... wh ... wha ... ?
`` what about you ? what will your dad think about you ? ''
fron kon steen !
yes . elsie taggart was the midwife .
yeah .

give me a break , will you . how often do i ask you for something ?
i told you , you know , i thought i was doing the right thing , you know , i think she 's innocent .
just looking .
and like , do n't take this the wrong way ... i mean , i 'm cool ... but ... you know ... i 've got a good reputation at school and , well ... i really do n't want it ruined .
why are you here ?
that 's what respectable folks do . get a job , get married , start having babies . that 's what you want , is n't it ?

heather , i feel awful , like i 'm going to throw up . can we jam , please ?
let 's talk about that . i 'm looking for some men .
here is where you must watch closely , gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
ah , love ! well of course in italy we know nothing about that .
minor officials bother you , do n't they ?
what happened to them ?
what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish ? i told drew and the board that bill depended on you . drew led me on , but i had no business telling him in the first place . he was setting up bill from day one . drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts . bontecou was outside , drew was mr. inside . and i was the fool who made it all happen . oh god , what do i do ?
so what happens now ?
i do not confess .
i do n't know . i told you , this is n't my apartment .
let 's talk about it some other time .
trust me . they wo n't recognize me .
the plaza hotel ?
you will .
are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ?
from the neighborhood ? shut the fuck up . you like telephones ? huh ? . you wanta go for a ride ?
yeah , but i like the sun . i grew up on a reservation . the sun , the desert ; they were like a religion to us . jake 's the same way . he loves the desert . i guess we 're alike that way . that 's about the only way .
they 're all in here . all the ones he killed . they 're just children ! we have to help them !
yes you can , robin .
and what are you doing ?
maybe , if you tell me the things you have n't .
you know how women kin lie ... i knock 'em around a little , ask 'em where the money is , they say they do n't have none ? ... but they coulda squirreled away that much , the five of 'em . maybe .
well yes , of course , majesty , and i 'm sure they are content ... except that ... well , they are starving .

you do n't understand . i want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , do n't care where or how you get it , just get it ... my wife tells me you put a move on darien . here 's some inside info for you . that euroflash gq guy she 's going with 's got big bucks but he 's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so do n't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i 've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . '' i like you sport , i ever tell you that ... gordon , call me gordon from now on .
blow out the candles !
sir ?
no sense worrying about it now .
you 're a jerk-off , you know that ?
replacement coming in ! harding out !
sport never treated me bad , honest . never beat me up once .
you have a king fantasy .
if you want me to !
well , what do you think ?
you kiddin ? who else would hack through south bronx or harlem at night ?
by the time we return there , all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed .
mrs. ?
what ?
ni , ni , ni !
this is the place --
let 's find a place out of the rain . i 'm sure we 'll get a ride in the morning .
staedert ? what 's going on ? did you destroy it ?
where 's maggie ? where 'd ya take her .

what does he think of your chosen line of work ?
the sun is setting , logan . you 've been asleep for nineteen hours .
take my car , okay ? you come with us , lenny .
well , it 's done now -- what 's the use of grousing about it . forget the letter , amy , i just had to blow off some steam ...
walter ?
they 're here .
no , sir .
dammit , beavis , i was about to score . huh huh .
you must be the new tenants .
you never know where you 're going to wind up when you go to a square dance !
did you get my note ?
so ?
paulie !
i just hold it loosely with both hands ?
yeah .
nope ... never finished one yet . i hate these things .
listen , there 're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you ...
'scume me .
maybe you can make more sense out of them than i can . i made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on christmas .
that 's the blasting cap - good ! okay , now grab it by the base and pull it straight up . no , wait ...
we do n't like razinin .
it 's not ming . it 's tong .
nothing can . not ever .
just drop it paul !
two years younger than you .
except i ca n't get you out of my head , grace .
well you do n't know that . ask him .
do what ? i have n't done a thing .
we all stick to this , it 's smooth sailing .
well , what 's the matter ?
what in god 's name are you doing ?
promise ?
nope - just came by to chat
right .
liz 'll give you a lift . she knows where to go and everything ... i do n't have time to talk , rob . i 've got too much to do .
no but you did n't defend him either ! did n't want to rock the boat . guess the ride was too smooth . filmore i was acting under legal counsel !
you . like the papers all say .
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing .
that sure looks like fun ... you know how long it 's been since i was behind the wheel ?
is that what you want ?
my first name 's -- clarissa .
nothing . nothing at all .
oh . . . no , there 's no one back home .
what do you mean ?
scully , i found the bomb .
hmm ?
wait . you mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ?
i 'm pulling up right now . evacuate the fucking van ! plans have changed ! < b > ext . texaco station -- next
a tape from the surveillance camera at the first national bank . it was robbed this morning .
excuse me , but ...
i 'm sure . but what else do you do with your time ? do you go to school ?
the other one ?
he wants us .
i insist .
duncan . my work is everything to me . this 'll never happen again . now stand back -- this session 's gon na make you remember why you hired me even though i would n't sleep with you -- cooper let 's get these penguins dancing --
yeah , you do n't know how to get outta this place !
okay . yeah .
an animal that does n't procreate . it spreads , grows . a living disease .
i 'm gon na mingle it with common house dirt .
wait ! wait ! there 's something i forgot to tell you .
i told that kraut a fucking thousand times i do n't roll on shabbas .
okay .
friend ogg . excuse our enthusiasm , occasioned as it was by a fondness for you .
interested ? follow the crow .
first lady ...
hey where 'd you go ?
ellie ...
you should n't always take me seriously . actually , i 'm used to it by now . first my mother and now my husband ; both of them are like dynamos .
bet they do n't dust crops in japan .
those same men will be sitting on the jury .
you do ?
oh-oh ... maybe i better get back in the truck .
it 's the last door at the end of this hall .
i 'm not -- i did n't -- al , you know how i feel about you ...
i can stay with the brokerage firm . and you 're doing fine . we can survive without gordon gekko .
should n't we wait for the others ?
yes , of course . but that only plays in this room , with people who are n't embarrassed to call themselves nazis . if you want a modern fascism , you do n't mention jews .
do n't you work with ian ?
in any case , gentlemen , a charming , beautiful , exquisite woman . i warn you , if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court , and when the duchess takes the stand ...
i know what they 're worth . give me fifty and get them out .
to win .
what ? what is that ?
from chinatown ... which is right up the street from the morgue ! where did you go with the body ? what did you do with it ?
yes i do .
what 's this ?
i 'm a greek , thank you . and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians . give our new colleague some of the cretan white . relax , tell me everything , i 'm your friend .
until your confirmation date .
maybe we should take it easy tonight .
ever wondered why jenny greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth ?
what ?
wait till the mai-tais wear off .
jesus ... maybe white 's not so dumb after all .
but laura ... that 's me . that 's all there is to me . there is n't anything else . if you 've lost interest in that , you 've lost interest in everything .
-- so if you think it 's appropriate , i 'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
flame on , asshole .
she does n't know , mrs. kane . she just sent it - because i made her see it would n't be smart for her not to send it .
what 's your name , boy ?
do n't you sweet talk me you ol ' spook , you !
so , you feeling anything ?
a few words ? i thought he was imbecile ?
mmm . i made good time . pilgrim 's in the back . i found a new stable , but they ca n't take him until tomorrow .
mary ! come back ...
disco inferno ? disco 's infernal morelike .
i tell you , my man . this is the american dream in action ! we 'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end .
took off . yes . they took off .
laura , no , i 'm not . i 'm not bob . poor laura . i wish i could help you .
i let them handle all the little stuff . i just come in on the big ones .
what ?
he 's a real piece o ' work . i wish you could meet him .
later on .
what 's the matter with your voice , commander ?
i do n't care to bargain . it 's full of saffron , just in case you think i 'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing .
hey , where 'd you go ?
samuel . samuel lapp . but what happened here is none of his affair . my sister is expecting me ... our train is leaving soon .
that 'd be me , sir . frank baker . this is my brother jack .
be sure you 're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked . understand ?
well , thanks , i --
this is n't funny , it 's twisted .
no , i want my cut !
i 'll commit that to memory .
i will not fight you .
a headline ? you 're not a newspaper man , are you ?
i have this theory that we 're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we 've done to nature .
c'mon . i insist .
please .
are you a fucking colossal idiot ?
mr poe ?
no , no . do n't call the police ! just tell him i 'm on the phone with you ... my name is lowell bergman ... just tell him that .
bullshit ...
yeah , she does .
no , he never told me about his friends . would you like some tea ?
-- shhh .
no .
i could n't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms . you know , he might only have thought he actually remembered them ...
do n't give me shit - what do you want ?
it 's over , elliot . i do n't know how to make it any clearer . it 's over . i ca n't see you anymore .
life is a bitch and then you marry one .
well ... to get a crack at something good , you got ta earn it , you got ta climb the ladder first . so you do , you work hard , and all these people behind you are pushing you up , shouting you on . and then one day you realize you are , you 're at the top ... and there 's nothing there . and you look behind you and there 's no one below . you 're just left there all alone ... swaying in the god-damned breeze .
it 's only a quarter of twelve . the clock 's right over there .
ummm , hootash im ... hootash im now what is this last symbol here ?
i 'll pay you .
or reno ? they always throw them off the bridge there , i 've heard .
who the fuck is he ?
i know about you .
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor .
jean-luc picard .
oh yes , she did . only too well . unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her .
to throw out of the window .
she 's afraid . come on , tell the boys you 're afraid .
i never felt better in my life .
he wo n't go into the interrogation room .
bingo ?
oh . they talk to me at university before fall of saigon . make deal .
i do n't know .
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego . you asked for blackmail , let me give you blackmail : mr hale-fellow-well-met , about to open his own business here , has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years , probably including half the people sitting on that jury . well , it finally caught up with him -- these dopes , it always does ; someone threatened to spill it . somebody knew his dirty little secret , just like your wife says . they called , they demanded money ...
i think we might of scared her .
you 're a killer , ozzy !
i went to bed around seven .
whoa , you better cut a bigger hole than that .
meaning , viznick 's a man who answers to no one . not even god .
oh . you have to tell me that .
my life was totally crappy , herb , and she ... fixed it . she made me happy . which i 'd never been . she loves me the way i am - < u > right now < /u > . < i > < /i > i do n't want everything to change . i do n't want her saying yes to some big success . i just want her saying yes to me .
jorge . you frightened me . what 's happening to you ?
deuce in the corner needs help .
what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you 're wearing ?
yes , sir .
let me say this out loud , just to get it straight in my mind . according to you , mr. blonde was gon na kill you . then when we came back , kill us , grab the diamonds , and scram . that 's your story ? i 'm correct about that , right ?
what is it ?
i guess he 's outside someplace i do n't like takin ' him down to certain places .
i 'll be right back .
that 's why they got you in jail ?
i dive in search of god . if i go deep enough i 'm going to find him .
be better if i could talk to him in person . but he 's not an easy man to get to .
can you give me some room here ?
those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant . they were executed at close range . that one there is a police officer killed by the mohawks up in canada more recently .
where is this going , johnnie ?
no you do n't .
of course not . only by a director of the firm . who 'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets ?
huh ? ! they dam that river on the 21st . today 's the 17th !
no -- no please -- oh , do n't go -- do n't go -- do n't leave me alone , baron .
so , how are you ?
excuse me ?
could be meant as a warning .
he ate a car ?
well , er , i think that was something that they had n't planned for , you see , missus , i 'm very fond of music and always have been , especially beethoven , ludwig van ... beethoven . b ... e ... e ... he leans over and looks at her writing in notebook .
what 's the matter ?
the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you have n't done it was him yet .
i know . i understand disappointment . i really do .
hi .
i could think of better places to meet her , instead of here . he lives on the whole top floor .
alright . let 's ... page five , the fucking < u > horse < /u > dies . you know , < u > she < /u > could be in the movie , she could , she 's got a good face , she could be the doctor 's ... uh , why does it have to be his , uh , < u > wife < /u > ... ? it could be his ...
you do n't need to do that .
i need to sit down a minute .
she knows i 'm catholic ! she never mentioned divorce ! not once !
great . now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the upper east side . but i misplaced it .
where to ?
done .
are you sure she was n't there ? maybe she was just hiding from you .
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it had n't been for your fuckin ' around !
i 'd say about three months . are you satisfied ?
i took the initiative .
it is n't < u > right < /u > . i ca n't ... i ... i know i si ... i , they , i do n't know if they told me it was in the con ...
mom , you know that never works .
yeah , pretty well .
oh shit , we 're late .
back it up , rewind , whatever you call it .
we 'd come twelve thousand miles together , through every kind of seas imaginable ...
so what are you doing out here ?
you know what happened to the tower of babel , do n't you ? it fell down .
i kinda thought so . felt like it .
i know ! i 'm sorry i did n't mean for it to happen ! and i was the one they were shooting at !
yeah . me ?
you 've gone crazy .
well , we ca n't go anywhere in this darkness . how long till dawn ?
not a chance , my dear fellow . the ggovernment ca n't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories . soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders . common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis . kill the criminal reflex that 's all . full implementation in a year 's time . punishment means nothing to them , you can see that ... they enjoy their so-called punishment . alex seizes his chance as they pass by .
i 'm soaked . oh great .
girls , i wanta apologize . for my language back there .
`` part the gates of heaven , '' as it were --
oh , yeah ... boy , that must 've been a while ago .
jesus , caesar !
well , we could try the bag over the head thing . walk you right out the front .
what `` magic '' ?
no ! christ . listen , kelly , i 'm counting on you . you calm her down . i mean do whatever you have to , whatever it takes ...
wendy ?
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you 're thirsty for wine .
am i attractive ?
at the end of the bar .
yeah .
i was n't hungry .
< i > chinga te y tu mama tambien. < /i >
when i needed to catch earthworms , i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them . i had to draw them out .
it 's fun .
really ?
you can stop it right now .
victor , wait , slow down a second . i want you to know i appreciate everything you 've done for me , but i just do n't --
right behind you .
[ within ] juliet !
then why ?
did you play arcade last night ?
is this stephanie 's kid ? sure is cute .
there is no information available on the man before he moved into benjamin rand 's . it has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the united states government .
help yourself . oh , tom , show this gentleman ...
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ?
nobody .
oh , thanks , but i 'm busy .
bullshit ! it 's about you ! about you deciding ! about you always being right ! you always getting everything your way , controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something !
when i walked out , i waited < u > ten < /u > < u > minutes < /u > outside your door . ten . waiting for you to come find me .
where to ?
so , what ? you 're saying we 're stuck here the rest of our lives ?
how much further ?
so , do you think you made it into the class ?
opening night , lillian .
see-cil .
gee , i 'd like to get inside and see how it works . what do you think makes it go ?
let me guess , they had a big white torpedo with them .
i 'll buy a plant .
sorry , baby . i 'm goin ' to birmingham .
he 's sitting in the fourth booth down , on the left hand side , with his back to us . he 's wearing a navy jacket . if you turn around , you can see part of his right elbow .
i would n't be caught dead in that .
you pull me up .
from over the mountain --
good . be careful , daniel , do n't let up your guard . look , i 'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at karnak until all this blows over . you two would be welcome to join me .
your story was terrible !
i was called away on urgent business , snake .
look at her legs .
i guess that means it 's okay .
you 're all under arrest . open up !
what are you so crazy about the movies for ?
hi .
i told jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money . be wants to know what 's happening . you got ta meet him .
i do n't wan na go , i ca n't do it this time .
you know ... the first time i ever saw your guys together ... i never saw him so happy . i mean , i know he 's a crazy jew fuck and everything , but ...
okay .
you know , that 's what makes the whole thing so funny . a guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary , everyday , slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains , mind you , he builds up a gigantic institution , employs thousands of people , becomes a great civic leader . and then the crash comes - and overnight he 's the biggest crook the country ever had .
what is it ? where 's casey ?
what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .
maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
okay , one of the caps turns it on , the other shuts it down .
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea !
have you got leave to go to confession to-day ?
then do n't talk about killing .
wow , that must be pretty nice there .
i do n't trust him .
jesus christ , give me a fuckin ' chance to breathe . i got a few questions of my own , ya know .
make a hole , billy-boy .
and be ready to make light of the offer if she 's unresponsive . this has to be done very skillfully , very diplomatically .
are n't you ever tempted to gamble ?
what ?
hello , remember me ?
and when i came down , my morals were corrupted forever .
can i see what you have so far ?
moving in ?
... still do n't feel no heat .
what have you got on miss mayfield ?
wendy !
i tell you , if we really wanted to bland in , that 'd what we 'd be wearing . i think it 'd be a good look for you , too . i 'll even help you choose a tattoo .
all right ...
hey -- if a good man can make a better life , let him make it .
it 's not exactly a scam , crease . even at half speed you 're pretty damn good .
sorry , that 's my son and the nanny . i had the calls transferred to my home so i could go over your stuff .
describe program function .
and you can depend on me , son . trust me . whatever comes we 'll face it together , i swear .
saddle river , new york !
i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life .
you know what i mean .
... he had a breakdown ... the dam broke ... my mother died ... he became a little boy ... i was fifteen ... he 'd ask me what to eat for breakfast , what clothes to wear ! ... it happened ... then i ran away ...
i do not seek forgiveness .
ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .
once i thought the biggest thing i 'll ever do was guard the president .
we 're going to kill him . do you understand that ? he 's going to die just like the others .
perhaps you would like to wait in my office -- ?
okay , anything . just ... go . i 've got ta work .
breathing through your pingala always works , honey --
first wes , now you ?
anything new develop ?
just ... just wanted to say hello ...
i thought i could , too . *my* business -- this fine future ! i have no future i *care* about , if this boy is broken ! i -- i ca n't sleep . the only important thing in my life now is to save what i can for him . i want him to get a start again -- i 'll see that he 's taken care of as long as he lives -- ! saunders -- whether you ever mean anything to him or not --
hey , betty . are you okay ?
good . i was concerned .
i can use you in the house of representatives . we need a man who understands dogs -- and that 's where this country is going to . step inside .
they tell me you 're an american agent .
what ?
there 's a one-drink minimum per show , i hope you saw the sign when you came in . anyway , they 're supposed to tell you .
what the hell is botox ?
that 's why the people trust you george . without someone at the convention , who has the people behind him , everything will fail . will you do it ?
... what ?
stay away from me .
never mind the who 's who -- before i get on this boat i want to know what 's what ! how about my raise ? all i get out of these ocean trips is dizzy .
it 's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road .
do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?
i 'm sorry .
what was it , kid ? smack ? angel dust ? do n't tell me acid 's back in fashion ?
i thought it best to be isolated , to be in a location with a definite sense of history , and i wanted to make sure that it was n't so pleasant you 'd all sleep too easily . you 'll be taking a variety of tests , none of them harmful , and you 've got the house , the grounds , and each other to keep you company .
they do that up north .
i see .
about his letters -- that 's all she remembered . quite violent material , i 'd say , obsessive , a quite sick man . but that 's not unusual either .
what a charming idea for moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade .
it 's wonderful . then why don'tcha get william f. buckley to kill the spider ?

who were you talking to ?
do n't shoot . it 's me .
naw ...
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress .
i like you . i like you . i been telling you all night , i like you ...
hey veronica , how 'd that teenage prevention t.v . suicide thing go ?
the bastard son of a hundred maniacs . some say he was murdered , though no body was ever found .
for this class ?
you 're not the quiet type , frances .
that 's the one . cathy brenner .
what ?
now you hear obscene chewing . you 're losing it , laurie .
it 's a perfect kaufman audience .
all right . let 's all go back in . adam ? you 're cool right ?
i ai n't askin ' what you 'll do after you get out , because i 'm gon na be dead and it do n't matter .
he must 've beaten us all here !
a dollar sixty-nine , plus tax .
no , sir . radar .
he says it 's a box .
yes . now .
i do n't know , dignan . i just --
so ?
i 'm running late here . i just came back for my briefcase .
no . there 's more . there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat .
ok. but do me one last favor , will you . can you give me two hours ? that 's all i ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow . i suspect it 's going to be a very difficult day .
mr. scott -- how soon ?
sure . you got some kind of -- bean juice on it .
we 're a team . we work together .
why ? is n't he sleeping here ?
this afternoon . our boats practically kissed in the harbor . james bond .
but wait . i still do n't understand what you do .
... when i got outta the army , clara , i was lost . i did n't know what i wanted to do . i was twenny-five years old , what was i gon na do , go back to my old job , forty cents an hour . i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i . biller rights , you know ? but i would n't graduate till i was twenny-eight , twenny-nine years old , even if i made it in three years . and my brother freddie wanted to get married , and i had three unmarried sisters -- in an italian home , that 's a terrible thing . and my kid brother nickie , he 's a one got married last week . so i just went to pieces . i used to walk inna streets till three , four o'clock inna mornings . my mother used to be so worried about me . my uncle mario come over one time . he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift . he got his own cab , you know . and god forgive me for what i 'm gon na say now , but i used to thinka doing away with myself . i used to stand sometimes in the subway , and god forgive me what i 'm going to say , i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels .
they were for me . they 're mine .
a few teeth ... that 's the price of his life ?
why is that funny ?
what , he 's cute ? that 's his idea of humor ?
if you have something to say , i suggest you say it to morpheus .
yeah .

she was beautiful . perfect to me - *
you 're free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do !

it was just ... more convenient as i was among soldiers ...
then i 'll tell you a story ? a lovely story . do you know the story of rapunzel ?
-- yes , senator -- just a minute , dear --
he was buttering her rolls . pumping her churn . splashing milk in her box .
thank you , your honor . further : ms. costello is a rebuttal witness . as a 'surprise witness ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
he 's not coming .
you can count on me , sir !
let 's go .
wait a minute - i 've got it . there ! off the port bow !
the bar code on your neck , max . i know who you are and i know who you 're running from .

mr. nevins ?
funny -- the first time i saw him i thought he was a doctor !
sal .
tell 'er to go straight to hell !
that 's putting it mildly .
i do n't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese , or rip you open and eat you right here .
is johnny here ?
pffft ! absolute nonsense . the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations , my dear mr. garrison - grimy young hoodlums who 'll say and do anything . as you well know .
thank you .
wow , she 's beautiful . you really think she looks like me ?
paul , what 's your favorite fruit ?

ten reasons . maybe fifteen . and also there 's something in it for me .
well ... i guess not .
-- okey , doke . last one to the roadeo is a homo .
this is very difficult for me to say ... but -- perhaps it would be best if you did n't attend the retreat .
what ?
yes . you may . you there . what does munro call you ? the `` scotsman '' has sent one of his indian allies to guide you .
a pilates machine ?
yeah he got away . come on let 's go .
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
i hope so .
you 're such an asshole .
it is n't yankee whisky , daddy , it 's scotch .
ready !

especially with an election coming up in a few days .
you 're a fucking great policeman , but give yourself a break . you 're here 5 minutes , you find yourself a fucking homicide ? .. not many people could do that in a place like this .. and you got ta admit , there 's a lot of shaky areas in this case ? .. i mean , stop me if i 'm going up the wrong nostril ..
sssh . that 's what i 'm taking care of . they need a letter of permission .
what desert ?
it 's your decision .
nothing is infallible , but so far the voight-kampff scale bas been foolproof .
i wan na go home .
huh ? no , she , she hit me right here .
what 's with your friend there ?
flynn had group 7 access .
once we 're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away .
mind your own business .
where are they going ?
golly -- i 'd like to see all your horses !
that 's too bad .
of course ! by kid-lawyers !
that 's more like the old sally -- a little bit of fire . how about ned ?
here 's a suggestion . let 's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this volvo situation .
i ca n't do that . not while the joker 's still at large .
i am the mighty ape !
gaiijin .
`` not having that which , having , makes them short . ''
figures .
i 'm tired and i 'm scared , and i 'm not looking at fucking penguins .
oh , that 's very - unusual .
if - instead of waiting until next season to do 'footsteps on the ceiling ' , which is in pretty good shape - and if margo can be talked into going on tour with 'aged in wood ' - we could put 'footsteps ... ' into production right away ...
even that would be an improvement .
adrian . it箂 too late . the world is blowing up as we stand here .
hello , bomb , are you with me ?
my family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston - imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money !
no way . i 'm about to blow up .
do you mind if i use that line in my next western ? you ca n't chuck me out , my papers are in order .
i do n't know who i am .
everybody hold on tight . we 're gon na send this sucker into oblivion !
and ...
it means nothing .
what we really need is some red meat in here for bait .
do n't look for it , taylor . you may not like what you find .
what 's that you 're wearing ?
no .
i mean morally . murray was my friend .
and she 's getting worse ...
what if she never starts dating ?
and how do you feel about gabrielle ?
no , it is n't that .
why not ?
i do n't know what happened to him . he just ran out into the streets . i got some old records i want you to hear . i like the blues sung simply , man and a guitar . or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life . do n't ever let anyone tell you his life 's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness . when i was a boy , a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i 'll be damned if the same thing did n't happen to me .
what do you think ?
you 're telling me your name is frank sullivan , you live in queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 series ... live ?
but i抳e done some good things too , haven抰 i ?
congratulations on the math contest , richard .
will you lighten up , please ?
what ?
oh .
i 'm getting tired of you riding me , jaeger .
i give up .
sure . you can have it . where 's your bag ? in the car ?
say , let 's get something straight here . i do n't want any part of this thing . if you 've got an idea i 'm going around lecturing to people , why you 're crazy ! baseball 's my racket , and i 'm sticking to it . come on , colonel , let 's get out of here .
get lost bobby .
. peggy sue , i love you , and i need you peggy sue ...
not for a long time , now .
what ?
for when the..uh , yeah , thanks , a little gold piece of ... gold . uh ...
i was dubious myself at first . then something connected -- the village 's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones ...
just have you for one second , please .
that 's nice , but we ca n't dodge this kind of heat for long .
i 've called liz . they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim . i thought we 'd stay at motels along the way ...
marv , let 's get ronnie set up here .
maybe i should get help .
three days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ?
oh , everything is so wonderful ! it 's getting farther and farther away !
that 's luke . he does n't like strangers .
jennifer gave her a make-over .
donna , you are a muffin .
i could be , too .
it 's vichyssoise , sir .
all street mimes should be executed .
you do n't know where your mother is ? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night ?
that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead .
how would you know ?
hey , i 'm proud of you , kid .
that does n't say a thing about t-rex , they could have been rogues . robert burke certainly thinks they were .
is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence leslie ?
fire him .
where are they ?
force the door .
chill . we do n't want your face coming off with it .
and what did he come back now for ?
oh my god , shut up !
not ! i tell you . no !
i 'm thinking .
who are you ! who are you !
you can have it , then . i 'm not going back there .
who 's that guy ?
we 're looking for a suspect . we 've reason to believe he 's still in the area .
okay ... but just ... just to see .
i do n't want to talk about it -
just a minute . no , you do n't .
what are you making :
you 've been very cold to me tonight .
it 'll spoil our supper .
you know , secretaries and stiff .
do n't just fuckin ' sit there , dumbass . do you understand ?
she told me she killed them .
no ! he 's crazy - he 's insane . he hates everybody . he 's got these plans - you 've got to help me , james . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry for everything . i know i was wrong - but you 've got to protect me . i know you still love -
this is n't about me anymore .
i do suppose so . but if you were there yesterday , guess you can get there today .
they were gore before i came here .
i love you , adam .
was there much blood ?
we 'll go to the zoo sometime . okay ? i think i might have some time on my hands .
she can not possibly refuse . her family is poor , they have even less money than we do . and along with the invitation , the king sent the diamond pendant , from the piglet .
it was n't supposed to be , it just struck me that way .
just call me barney .
that 's a good reason to dump your girlfriend .
-- and i try and teach the students to ask : what is it in aid of ?

swell . thanks very much . good luck , senator . keep your left up .
it 'd take mounths ... and cost a fortune .
really ?
hey , squirt ! you want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast ? it ai n't good for much but bait .
yes . screw george washington . just like marilyn monroe did .
i would n't do that , fettes . i would n't report it .
that would matter not were the force flowing through you . higher you 'd jump ! faster you 'd move ! open yourself to the force you must .
this really is n't a good time .
this gun yours ?
you put explosives around the habitat , i ca n't imagine what you 'd put in a drink .
me neither .
i 'm not through with you yet .
you scared me .
great . great . so listen , uh , i was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know , with me .
they 're part of the team . one of them 's the guy i told you about .
when i was twenty-seven years old , in jersey city , i asked a woman to marry me . she had red hair . she smelled a jasmine . she wore black shoes with pointy white tips .
uh , probably like , another five minutes or something .
only cowards make crank calls , sweetheart , nothing is going to happen .
or worse , we 'll have a hostage situation on our hands .
this is insane .
there was a boy there ... said mama was a jailbird ... said he could prove it..
i do n't know .
it 's me .
tomorrow when some piece like that 's scratching your back in a fifth avenue townhouse , where 'll your pal rizzo be ? nedicks .
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that 's what i would 've done .
you had disadvantages .
... who sent you ?
you know it 's real . you know it 's real , and you know it 's there . you know it .
come on , fellas .
freezy , i 'm feeling ... hot .
you 're in a tent , darling . you 're not at home . and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice .
we got ta get back soon ...
better be . you left me for him .
go back to 316 , bobbie . the sound bite in the cab -- it starts , 'i do n't know how i 'll feel ... '
is there something we can do ?
you look so sad . is it something i have done ?
listen kid , i think you better understand who you 're dealing with here .
yeah , let 's check out the low-life .
but you know it already . why must i tell you ?
i admire that in a person . as for myself , i find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times ...
just every once in a blue moon , you know .
go on .
why do you say that ?
i have n't . no .
yes , sir , so it was -- thanks to you . but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written ...
sir , i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels ...
good morning .
he ran away ?
he does n't speak english .
oh , well that 's easy : i 'm hot . you 're ... well , you 're a little limp . sue 's easy to see through . and ben 's always been a hardass . why are n't you writing this down ?
i see .
what 's your next step , nick ?
she 's amazing . she 's ninety-three , she 's a writer , and i told her about you .
i know all that , chief , and i do n't like it any better than you do , but there 's something else --
nice . always a good idea to show up your instructors . he nods toward jester , glaring at them from his a4 . goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat .
i need this ?
what do you mean you made it all up ?
your answer to my question . it 's one thing to have never been injured in your life , but to state that you 've never taken ill , well that 's a whole new level .
she was beaten , and bloodied , and it was going to go on , uni ...
quitting time . grab a cold one ?
keep it .
look young lady , i grew up through the depression . i fought in the second world war . six days a week i get up and deal with the public , the bank and the bill collectors . and on the seventh day , when god rests , i do n't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool !
i 'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk .
cause you 're the man , right ? the magic man . if it 's got something to do with the wire , sooner or later it washes up on your beach .
well , your highness , what makes you think we 'll ever sign a treaty with you ?
maybe . well , it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here .
i suppose i could phone the store in the morning , and say i 'm sick .
that was a lifetime ago .
why do n't you two stick to reality .
please ...
when you remember ...
who 's our little man ?
really .
that 's what we should 've done in the first place .
i 'm at work , asshole . where else ?
hello ?
no ! ... no ...
does n't matter .
big date tonight ?
... .yeah ... .
for trying to impose some decency on that sort .
fine ... and when the tricyclatops comes after you , do n't come crying to me .

no need to be modest , brian .
i 'm late . got ta protect and serve the world , y'know .
the -- folks or people , what 's the difference among friends ?
no ... i am sure not . that is why i am so concerned ... someone must now be producing it here . but none of my people know how to make it . the process was carefully guarded .
he knew .
uhhh ... anything i can do for you ? she laughs again , does n't know what it is ... could be chemical , but she 's instinctively attracted .
wow ... that 's pretty good ...
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here .
you ask them .
he 's a plumber .
no way .
like ...
with mrs. evans . i hate her .
perfect .
please , man , i 'm suffocating in here .
hard to compare the people you 're taking down with the lord .
< u > you 're surprised < /u > ! ... but i guess i just never met the right guy . whatta gon na do ?
maybe you 've got the wrong crypt 棗 after all it 's twenty years when you wore last here .
well , no one would ever suspect it . you do n't sound right .
i do n't know , grady . i just dropped him on a corner .
walk away .
so . five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man . no woman since then ?
speaking of which , duck !
yeah .
i 'd like to speak to dr. carlson , please .
... wan na give it a try !
i do n't see how i can . and i ca n't prove any of this . i got all this information illegally . also it could get you in trouble .
aggghg ! we 're gon na die ! we 're all gon na die !
uh , so that a vaccine can be developed that will , uh , allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth .
you never called me back . i left messages .

good ... good boy . oh yes , i understand you 're fond of music . i have arranged a little surprise for you .

i have told the truth .
i do n't think i could really describe it .
there 's no witnesses ...
it 's making me hungry .
let 's go tell paula ! god , i wonder where we 'll be stationed first . i hope it 'll be hawaii . i 've always wanted to go to hawaii .
you see , i have this thing about saxophone players .
a man like ringo 's got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he ca n't ever fill it . he ca n't kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it . and it drives him mad . sick mad . cold and dirty .
magda ? she 's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she does n't like to be alone .
i love you too .
sandra sinclair .

there is n't gon na be a next time . we 're gon na get out of here .
lieutenant , i have a top secret clearance . the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you .

duff - you know those women you used to know --
i thought i could handle it . i did n't want to bug you . i thought i could handle it on my own , but i could n't . she 's in real bad , auggie .
really ? then ... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom , or even in a teardrop ?
they did what ? ! i do n't understand . why 'd they go into o'brien 's office in the first place ?
okay ! okay ! keep your shirt on , young feller .
oh , god ... no ... not molly .
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives ! you have chosen to join my army ! this army is my mother , my father , and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze , do you understand me -- give me a sir , yes , sir !
well , you 're doing something wrong , mrs. sutphin . i 'd recommend therapy for your son . thank you for taking the time to come to pta .

we got ta get his money so we can get outta here -- we got ta --

'these are really just children , ' he said , 'but they 've been exposed to a lot already .

why would she lie ?
joseph harbin ? no ... no .

hey , now -
well , enough about the king , how 'bout you ?
like he 'd never hire me for real . not week-to-week . i do n't have the credentials . he thinks i 'm just a sociopath , someone he can turn to when he needs `` plausible denial . ''
but maybe we 're the ones who should be down there . doing something . making it better .
guard barracks . take some shots .
thank you , doctor . i 'll keep it in mind .
01766 770 471. let me check it for you , sir .

hey , dude , you got a tattoo .
just trying to help , lilly .
i 'm going inside .
and there 's the winner of the truman capote look-alike contest .
unfortunately . i sat between them at the bronx zoo benefit -- it was better than seconal .
sure , a rice burning crotch rocket ...
elijah muhammad can get you out of prison . out of the prison of your mind . maybe all you want is another fix . i thought you were smart .
mop rags -- mop rags -- we 're interested in something quite different !
we 'll smash his face in . that 's what we 'll do .
puppets . maxine . it 's the idea of being inside someone else , feeling what they feel , seeing what they see ...
i do n't know where it is . it 's not here . it 's been stolen .
if i had a $ 100,000 boat , i sure as hell would n't leave it anchored alone in the channel .
kathryn , you know i love you . i 've always loved you .
well ?
oh , adam . i do n't have gloves . my nails keep getting longer . i 'll break them .
i want him back !
hiding ?
i can not . i must not . here i must stay .
it 's a beautiful country . very clean . very civilized . and cold .
i just want to make an honest woman of you ... .
you must have had fun .
you been on prozac long ? dexadrine ?
you rolfe ? i remember you from high school . you 're a teacher now ? harvard ?
i appreciate this , eddie , members of the board , this will just take a minute of your time . as the custo- dians of the company , you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- -- or not . either way , thanks .
do n't you think it 's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ?
there 's no time -- i 'll call you in the morning .
you 've been in an institution , have n't you , james ? a hospital ?
do what ?
if you say , miss . if you say .
i got ta know ... did it work >
call me johnnie ... n.o . has always been a good town to sit around in .
you must be . you have responsibilities . you must learn the rules . you can never attract attention to yourself , never show the side that will draw others to you . you will always know when you are in the presence of another . beware . but more importantly conor macleod , will be your battle against time . in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat . people will become a transitory , pathetic lot . the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent . but life without morality , without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love , is no life at all . that is how the others exist . nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last . keep your soul sewed to the earth . do not become one of them .
that 's an expensive gun .
the set-up is wrong . we 're doing all the legwork , and at the end of the day , we 're still paying retail . we 're getting middled .
what ?
goddamn you !
why ? so you can kill me too ? tex is dead , i 've seen him ! he said dyle did it !
not enough . we 're out numbered and out gunned . they 'd cut us to shreds .
what 's normal ?
thank you , steed .
go to hell .
goddamn , merlin . there any part of the day you do n't smoke ?
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep .
oh .
you know what you got here ?
my name 's sondra .
she does not !
not here , duff .
a homo ?
oh ! great . that 's great !
it 's your birthday ?
no ... she only comes to sit . two or three times a week . and i never ask questions , you know . as long as they 're well behaved . i must say that i 've wondered --
i heard she got straight a 's .
do n't really have the market for something like this ... i can go two ... two-fifty .
oh , my god ! what is that ? ! why you showing me this shit ! ? jesus ! jesus ! get those away from me !
can i help ?
whenever you lose , you get this attitude . but it 's just a game .
what the fuck happened to you ? one minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas --
why do n't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings -- who < u > cares < /u > ?
i 'll make it up to you , i promise .
then it must be a helluva idea .
blow .
why not ?
eve ? i 'm leaving .
how 's egghead ?
you dropped a glass .
delay that order , scotty ... ! disengage all main drive systems !
you 'd take no offense if we called you dela for short ?
here we are ! i 'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace .
husband came home . found that guy and his wife `` in flagrante '' . now he 's holding her at knife point .
i *know* this was right .
hurry up , hurry up . we open in five minutes .
oh , gruesome . i wonder if the baby 's claws could scratch your vag on the way out ?
did he ask me to take my clothes off ? no , he did n't .
so what 's going on , joel ?
of course .
no , keeper .
she loves me , thomas !
sell ?
lovely . how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali ? zipping through my inheritance per usual ?
nobody .
that 's the magic number .
~e 're alive !
sir william cosgrove , with his complication of ills , was dying before us by inches . he was continually tinkered up by doctors , and , what with my usual luck , he might be restored to health and live i do n't know how many years . if cosgrove would not die , where was the use of my pursing his lady ? but my fears were to prove groundless , for on that very night , patient nature would claim her account .
no , you ca n't . and i 'll tell you this -- he scares me . as kind as he is , he scares me . you ca n't fool around with him , not with that man . and , boy , i sure better not try nothin ' like that with him again , he 'll fire me .
would you stay with me while i sleep a little ?
but what ?
matter of face there 's this flick i 've been hearing about . i have n't seen it , but from what i hear it 's pretty cool .
and something else that might interest you .
5:11 .
see ya ' chuckie . i had fun .
you said that ?
no thank you , you crazy old woman .
we were talking one time , drinking rum . i may 've mentioned adele , how she worked for a magician . chino got interested . he 's like , yeah ? how does he saw the woman in half ? he wanted to meet her . or get a look at her if she ever came to visit .
looks good .
it 's been two days . you should call that girl nikki ...
i do n't want to talk about that .
you think i ca n't learn that ?
you 're up front . everything 's free up here .
i 'm glad we got here in time .
it 's them .
his pleura 's in fine condition . it should be clear sailing through this area .
all set . foley 's rooms in the senate office building -- nice , big clean desk -- lot of senator stationery to write his little boys on -- and foley 's secretary , saunders , to make it look like the real thing --
i do n't know how far you 'll have to travel to find supplies , but if you ca n't get home by nightfall , i want you to look for something called a holiday inn . write that down . it 's a hotel . there might still be one standing .
when i said you being the best salesman here did n't say much , i meant for us . i know your record with sarber and webb , and i 'd say you 're a top-flight man , but you 've had no incentive . no one walking on your heels . just a lot of half asses , so the tendency 's been not to stretch yourself . i 'm bouncing the slobs , incidentally .
how do you know ?
it 's a guy you know .
yeah . i 'll see ya ... dad .
no ... i was hoping to get a kiss .
i have felt it .
how are you , crabtree ?
it 's kinda money , actually .
you look wonderful .
no .
aye , and that 's why i know where it 's going to be , and that 's why i know what barbossa is up to . all i need is a crew .
i do n't think so . it 's more of that gozer thing . she says she 's the gatekeeper . does that make any sense to you ?
something 's not right ...
i do n't want to hear about her anymore .
i do n't need you to `` stick . ''
the horniest dog in nevada .
i 'm not gon na leave you !
never mind , son . she does n't want it .
i 'd rather not .
there are < u > other < /u > explanations ! she is not the goddamn witch , that 's insane !

i do not marry tonight .
so it was you all the time .
oh , no i wo n't my dear - oh , no i wo n't my dear - i 'll wash behind my ears , but no i wo n't my dear !
and he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass ... ?
wait a second --
i believe the captain feels that starfleet 's mission has always been one of peace -
tyrell , i appreciate it , but have you seen my people dance ? we make the mouth face , we move the fingers --
how 'd you know ?
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and i got my second demo into production , is i 'm a lot smarter than you . i never give my best stuff away .
you got any whiskey ? how 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey ?
all the same entry wounds . it 's definitely him . she lives ... lived here . a prostitute .
where you think you 're going ?
well you can understand why we did n't say anything . if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us .
no way . i 'm so happy i 'm about to bust . here , honey . this is for you . it cost me my whole savings , but i said what the fuck .
i meant about my idea .
that 's just a dream , william !
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman 's room when she 's alone .
two cents worth of shoelaces ?
always count on old wade for a good screwing . why should i always pay more , sell cheap ? why should you guys make all the money . you and mel and jack . right 's right .
very funny . very funny .
well , you know ... moretti told me before that you were drugged up .
or maybe just phone out for a pizza ?
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie .
and who am i hiding from ?
i can imagine .
just one word of advice for next season .
i notice you 've sub-divided your b coupons . feeling a little light on principle ?
yeah . i 'm awake .
please . you can kill me but leave my daughter alone .
who is it philip ?
how come you 're calling me from ... ?
the *bills* ? jeff -- let me advise you -- as your father would -- politics is a business -- sometimes a cruel business . in your time here , you could n't even start on those bills . they 're put together by legal minds -- after a long study . why , after twenty years , i ca n't understand half of them myself . no , really , jeff -- in your own interests --
i ca n't believe you let them do this !
can you pay me now ?
who ?
what are these , beauty marks ?
is everything done ? the arrangements , i mean .
the night you arrived , mom asked you if you had a family and you lied , did n't you ?
you sure ?
fuck you .

no . no , but we 're planning to .
i 'm sorry , mr. basquiat .
ok. marcie . starting now i want you to have a new attitude with me . the more you play games , the more suspicious i 'm gon na become that you 've been up to something .
`` i die knowing no one knew the real me . ''
no matter . come with me . we can always use a good carpenter .
you must . luke , look at me !
hey , you 're the one that wanted to major in journalism . anyhow , was n't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it , it was twenty-five years ago , he probably does n't even remember it .
oh for fuck 's sake . nobody uses that gate .
it 's just possible she did n't ...
i know they get pentangeli , that 's all i know .
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin , where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound . i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house , where captain o'reilly will welcome with delight , my gallant young preserver .
i 'm inquisitive .
stu was with me last night .
it 's already begun . if you want to save her , send her away .
the post-vegas man .

i thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore .

i thought not . birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx , miss daniels ; a hundred and twenty million years ago !
grrrhmmnnnjkjmmmnn !
agh !
it is n't the fourth dimension . to you it 's the fourth dimension , maybe , to me it 's simply the truth .
why , what 's wrong ?
will they consider this a violation of his probation ?

thousand dollars a game .

i 've never heard of a cure .

how are we going to cope ?
i admire that , you being true to your wife . i 've seen a lot of ... of men ... who were n't .
you can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night . and tell them where he 's going .
oh no ! -- i just remembered .
maybe you should think about it .
staring . consequently , when he approached me on his way out i was n't surprised , but i did n't let on .
can i speak to you in confidence ?
okay .

that 's the problem .
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress .

thanks officer park ... vance .
that 's awful . the poor woman should be taken care of immediately .
guess i must 've learned .
no ! you ca n't ! they 're in on it .
is n't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it .
he 's a brave man .
he needs a room , dusty .
i remember the first time you walked into mrs. temple 's class in 2nd grade . blue gingham dress . blond ponytail .
if you did n't want me chasing him , you should n't have taken me to that funeral home .
okay , come on . time to slow down .
she < u > likes < /u > me . she said for me to call !
this is just temporary . i once made nine hundred in outcall .
- that you 're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -

sheriff dylan , this is fbi agent thomas mackelway . remember me ?
if there 's a babylon , man , that 's it . we leave her in there , she ai n't comin ' out , steppin ' razor or not .

i think he wants to see your rabbit foot .
if you come to talk about that muthafucka , i 'm gon na get up and leave you sittin ' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha .
i see the help -- judgement call .
fire the whole division .
i was afraid of that .
why would they exaggerate ?
i 'd say about two weeks .
all the insides are gone !
well -- i -- i do n't know -- i would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet , but -- really -- i think i would live the same .
sure .
and what is your boyfriend 's name ?
i want to talk to you later .
really ?
so get the fuck outta here .
well , for your sake , i hope you 're right . but i think my other guest may disagree with you . elaine , you had another date in mind ?
not anymore . at first i was amazed ... but when you are fighting in a just cause , people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement . even when it is dangerous or --
release first safety .
i know ! let 's go hock loogies off the eiffel tower !
starfleet , are you aware of our currant status ?
chip , honey ?
i never heard about that .
sure . every bunco man in the country knows gondorff .
what do you want me to say , frank ? i was killing men when i was fifteen . i like getting shot at . i like riding out of town with a posse at my back . this is a helluva better life than farming .
i should n't be . we made great progress today . i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases . he did rather well , too , but i had to lead him every step of the way . though frankly , at times i was unsure of who was leading whom .
that 's right .
right .
sure . where to ?
not particularly . i understand the point of view of the hound , too .
... he 's a good man ... ? he 's the prince of fuckin ' darkness ... he 'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her tuesday on a surfboard at hyannis ... do n't fuck with this case .
that 's right .
melissa ... ?

- riding to hounds -
yeah . fine , thank you .
husband . . . ?
if i were to go into exile , could we expect any serious assistance , from india , suppose ?
i guess she 's busy .
we think this party might cheer her up . just make sure you know what 's expected of you .
in two months , no one 's going to even remember this happened .
he 's smart .
where 's the anti-toxin ... ?
i 'm not going .
i did .
he 's downstairs .
yah .
i ca n't stay on this line . i 'm picking people up . i 'm already overdue . hello ?
oh . you coming by tonight ?
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?
i should be in therapy .
sickness comes to us all , mister dillon .
you idiot !
people remember me from the news . can you drive me back now ?
i was sure trying .
but . ... why did n't you say something , tripp ? i mean , what are we doing here ?
it 's the morphine trevor . you 're on so much of it , you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open .
what are you talking about ?
look , nosey -- your pals would like to get in on this , would n't they ?
damnit ...
i would like to marry you . but i have already promised myself ... to god .
do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now ?
they go .
and what did he say ?
what is it ? you look like you 've seen a ghost .
i understand . thank you , my name is galvin . i 'll be at the following number in a half an hour . it 's urgent .
yeah , but ...
sera , i love that name ... s.e.r.a . before we proceed onwards , there is something i need to say . ok ?
downstairs ... at the front ... jesus ...
no . but i have a hangover .
it 's night .
... of the west .
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased !
it would be a full-service law firm , by and for blondes , providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas . i mean , think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model .
i did all right on mccord .
y'know it is , a bit .
what did he talk about when you guys went out ? did he say anything ?
you got a girlfriend ?
dad ...
i 'm so glad to see you , sara .
not normal weed . this is some fucked-up skunk class a. i ca n't think let alone move shit .
healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art .
absolutely .
they sure must have been travelin ' . this keeps up we can start a store .
time is of no importance , only life is important .
as much as possible .
no , you do n't understand . it 's been wonderful meeting you . but ... i have a husband . i have two kids at camp . i have a life i have to go back to .
i 'm sorry to barge in -- but i figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news ?
you 're precious to me , rose .
jewelry ?
who told !
we 're going shopping -- !
someone who challenges you in every way . who takes you places , opens things up for you . a soul-mate .
what 's the matter with right here ? it 's nice and warm .
he 'd assume we had .
i 'm sorry , honey .
i wish you would n't talk like that , pete .
you 'll be fighting with the octopus .
i 'm sorry --
oh , yes , now i 'm with you . [ he changes his accent ] but , gee , mister , i 've got my license to think of ... we 're doing a hundred now ...
yes , yes , yes , yes ... right away ...
which means he probably knew her .
hos qordu .
do n't be facetious darling . now drink your milk , you 're late for college
no ! ... no ! ...
it 's not because he 's young , it 's because he 's ignorant and arrogant . his sister is a better man . that 's why i have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the senate .
is n't it obvious ?
you do n't say . how real does it feel ?
how are you ladies doing this evening ?
how 'd you know ? just tell me that . how 'd you fucking know ?
i do n't want ya cleanin ' nobody else 's cages no more .
yeah . real hot .
.jeffrey ! . nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store . maybe going back to school will be an option one day . i hope so .
nobody touches me .
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time .
no , no , it 's my fault -- we did n't have a proper introduction -- -
another month and we do n't see 'em again 'til next summer .
jake , jake , come over here . mike , i want you to meet jake cohen ; he manages the casino for us .
we got engaged .
thank goodness . we 'd be out of work .
i do n't know .
because your body can only take so much of what they 're putting you through .
too flashy ... they 'll clash with the new outfits .
hey , captain kirk . i think maybe i have second thoughts .
yeah . they 've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts . have any idea what this land 'll be worth with a steady water supply ? about thirty million more than they paid .
the girl out front mentioned strader 's assistant , somebody named watson . maybe he knows .
that is another matter . there is a price to all this , required both by longshanks and our nobles . pay it , and you will be our king . and we will have peace .
you do n't really believe something like that happened do you ?
if this is what the world will be like , i do n't want to live in it .
i 'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd , but i want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl .
you 're an investor , is that it ?
wander about .
yes . well , i 'm coming over to your house to get some things .
i am the walrus .
and you 're very brilliant , and you must be a good man , or you could never have created such a wondrous , loving creature as misery chastain . like a baby . all done .
had ?
how old , kid ?
piece of fucking cake .
you okay , man ?
would you like a tranquilizer ?
i do n't know - but he 's from the fbi .
private property , bub .
kay .
as i said , he is n't italian . besides , i thought they just killed them .
no , bruce , you did n't come between us . it was all over for her before you came on the scene . for me -- it 'll never be over .
harold , that picture is almost twenty-five years old .
can i come over after jamie 's asleep ?
i knew there was a sound explanation .
ze girl ? ... she seems like a very nice girl . she *plays* , monsieur , like a very nice girl . ztinks . very nice girl . however , ztinks .
she 's in the kitchen . i 'd yell for her , but i 'd die . you had a busy night last night .
sha la la la that ai n't no crime .
now that 's bullshit , lee . every time you buy one of those little movies it 's a risk . i 'm not sellin ' you something that 's gon na play two weeks , six weeks , then go straight to cable . this is `` doctor zhivago '' . this 'll be packin ' 'em in for a year and a half . two years ! that 's two years you do n't have to work with anybody 's movie but mine .
it 's initials . f is feur . it 's her .
ummmmmmmmmmmmm .
rodents of unusual size ? i do n't think they exist ...
where 's the money , lebowski ?
and how did you find his work ?
i am . i only work when i have to . two years ago i got a notion and went to china . there was a war going on . swell ! after a while it got stale . i went down to tahiti . just lay on the beach for six months . what could be sweeter ?
this is about freedom of speech , stan , about censorship .
not as much as being jailed for theft of government property , or for failure to pay income tax , on undisclosed income .
yeah . maybe so .
i used to . with my old man . he taught me how to hunt and trap . trapping 's a lot harder than most people think . we used to go after raccoons mostly . they 'd get into our garbage , our fields . when an animal ca n't live peacefully with those around it , it has to be destroyed . but they 're crafty little devils . you see the trick is , you can put your trap down , but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent . you ever smell raccoon scent ? smells like shit , but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy . he 'll walk right up to that trap , even though it do n't look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it . you know why ? cause he ca n't help himself . the scent drives him . so , if you want to catch a raccoon all you got ta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he 'll walk right into the trap .
i wish these people would leave already . i ca n't listen to another story . did you see him ? that doctor says the brain is coming around . they 're waiting for the heart to stabilize . i do n't know who to believe . he says they still have to keep him tied up .
i ca n't help you . no one can . the precogs are never wrong .
you what ?
you want to fuck her ?
yah .
mind your own business , peaches .
i made you write a beautiful song ...
holly -- that 's not so .
now who are we talking about ?
my tailor . wants to be an actor . i have a few debts here and there . well , that seems to be everybody . did you see a romeo ?
i do n't drink intoxicants .
it 's not my car , now is it ? it 's laura 's car , and thus laura has it . so it 's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab . wow . fucking great .
no .
attempted murder .
did you wait until you were 18 ?
christ , what is going on in there ?
unwritten rule of the sea . we do n't bother each other , stick to ourselves . ask anybody .
goddamn sonofabitch ! i do n't want to hear anymore ! sonofabitch ! burn the damn thing ! i do n't want to hear it ! throw it away !
hey , do you have any glue in your bag ?
natalie who ?
i do n't know . i packed up my shit and ran away . to this ... so unlike you , i guess i do have something to prove , in a repressed anger sort of way .
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again ...
and you 're gon na tell me who .
not my birthday again ?
i mean he 's of your race . he 's an ape . look . you do n't have to be afraid . we 've put him in chains and under sedation . do you understand that ?
what were you saying , governor ? sorry .
fuck off !
your name is < u > beetle juice < /u > ? yecch ! that 's as bad as < u > deee < /u > lia < u > deee < /u > tz .
nothing . just the cyclist . he 's passed us .
beck 's just put us on standby for crisis entry .
do n't look ! turn around .
..i swallowed her blood right along with my mother 's milk . she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her . me and her waited for our daddy . i love her . i do . she never hurt me . i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own , and tender as she is with me , i 'm scared of her because of it . all the time , i 'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own , could happen again . whatever it is , it comes from outside this house , outside the yard . so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it ca n't happen again ... i have to keep it away from my sister ... i 'll protect beloved ... 'cause she 's mine ...
i think it 's beginning to dawn on mr. rogers that i mean what i say . with mr. rogers out of the way , reilly , i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state . well , mr. bernstein ?
she is but an arriviste .
steak 's really good tonight . scooby good .
i insist on being told exactly what you have in mind .
no . it 's just my job to find him . i was in the hospital after garrett jacob hobbs .
yeah .
i was going to ask you the same thing .
oh , no , hey . like i said . tammy would n't ... she ...
what do you charge for company , vivian ?
this is n't a joke . your parents spend a lot of money to send you here . i 'm trying to help you .
shep proudfoot . that 's a name .
canyon country .
i 've seen it before .
keep your voice down !
yep .
pretty good , too . lots of detail . nothing hard core . old-fashioned ones , from back when people cared about atmosphere and character .
i thought this was a group effort .
so you 're not a fruit ?
what 's that ?
it 's okay . you need me ?
then梱ou 'll have to git !
i uh ... i had lunch in town today . happened to cross paths with `` that redfield woman . '' i apologize . i thought you were half-joking about that .
paul , i 've sent my soldiers to rescue the lady prime minister , she 'll need a room .
i just thought i 'd surprise you . what 's the matter ?
the fuck do you have goin ' on with sam albert ?
make up your mind , trigger .
you seem to be a bit nervous , sir .
cuter again .
where 's my pill ... ?
sure .
there 's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin ' for a fly . i 've already been workin ' on a young fellow from chicago -- related to one of the big packin ' families -- on his way to biarritz for a good time . likes a little game of bridge and poker .
someone else ?
you came back for the book ? why ?
huh ?
how is ben feeling ?
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word to-morrow , by one that i 'll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
does the phrase `` nosy '' have any meaning to you , lily ?
do n't knock it . a girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money . then you 're free . you can go off to europe , meet somebody , get married . my girlfriend 's going to buy her own beauty parlor . not me . i 'm gon na travel . 'keep movin ' that 's my motto . would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar-eighty an hour , having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you ? i can make more money suc ... doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job .
are those for me ?
that 's probably her now . or the police .
innocent !
i 'm on the last page . how do you spell conscience ?
i thought so too ! i was sure you'd * remember . but you did n't . *
what do you want , vic ?
how 'd you know my name .
he --
i told you , they hired me over the phone . i never met anyone .
you could say that .
she 's doing the work herself .
that was my companion . she sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice , of course .
we 're in there . we 're in there --
i heard them morgan .
i did n't do anything --
who ?
yes , but i , well , < u > you < /u > know ...
i 'm sorry .
yes , sir .
so you sold ninety thousand units . so what ? does that mean you 're a genius ? you 're a great artist ? you 're higher up the ladder ? you got an extra gold star on your fuckin ' forehead ?
silence ! i order you !
this sounds sad as a weeping willow .
right now , it does n't seem so .
i 'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it .
pretty as a picture .
really ? it seems so fattening .
so what do we do ? do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now ?
get everyone out here . then call the sheriffs . tell them we have a possible hostage situation .
good , good . leave now ; there 's a car waiting to take you to the airport .
someone needs to grow up . i wo n't take it , jack .
what 's the matter , paul ? you have n't written a word .
i never thought of that .
have n't you already done a bit of that ?
no , just crap . i want some picture frames .
well , of course , if you put it that way .
asshole . but she wo n't miss anything , that . you 'll see .
are you sure ?
how about you ?
no .
yes .
great .

the what ?
get away from me ...
well , i think if you take several lines out of context , star wars becomes a very sexual movie . i mean listen to this . `` luke , at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ? '' or `` you came in that thing ? you 're braver than i thought '' .
well , i got in everywhere i applied , but cornell is my first choice .
there 's a lot of water between vancouver and the u.s.a. this note is a suicide note . after you 're gone where would they look for you ? why would they look for you ? darkness , and open water , and a fast cabin cruiser . and i have a pocket full of money . and if i helped you , i 'd be committing a crime , or so they tell me .
no , madam . we have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow . so please you , let me now be left alone , and let the nurse this night sit up with you . for i am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business .
no , you listen ! you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards ...
what 'd you say ?
yes , but .
and only two are hers .
i 'm sorry , mary . my old dad used to say 'when you ca n't change a situation , laugh at it . ' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it .
it is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in new york , hollywood and london are no different from the good people of des moines , chillicothe and liverpool . by and large , we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics , egomaniacs , emotional misfits , and precocious children-
no , i ... i never killed anyone !
come on , admit it . k worried you , did n't he ? he always worried you . in 1942 , he 's thirty-four years old , you 're already fifty-six . and goebbels and goering keep saying to you , 'if you do n't do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i do n't care how great you are . it 's the oldest story in the book , the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck . the real reason you did n't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you 'd be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party 's boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
pete ...
leland , what are you doing ?
you 're still paying for it . it 's still your room .
if i had you where i really wanted you , they 'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde .
i 'm still thinking about it .
do i know you ?
i抳e got work tonight , jane .
you must be so pleased , i followed your jellybean trail right here , like a good little chump .
i tried a little while ago . the phone 's dead .
easy , son . you just need to get your feet back under you , that 's all . come on , boy , let 's kick south . down to the old playground .
i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes . they came with a free gift coupon in every pack .
austin is very charming , very debonair . he 's handsome , witty , has a knowledge of fine wines , sophisticated , a world-renowned photographer . women want him , men want to be him . he 's a lover of love -- every bit an international man of mystery .
your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie ; they did n't need that to talk among themselves .
i 'm well , thank you .
i hurt you ?
it 's andy again .
would you like something to drink ?
somebody took it from him . that 's what this whole thing 's about .
that man 's a black angel , sailor . you hook up with him , you 'll regret it . if you live to .
toast first then we talk seriously , i can see you are serious about us .
the only thing you ca n't do is get sex for free . i know i was in prison for like basically the 80 's , but , call me daffy , are n't you supposed to < u > stop < /u > me from committing crimes . you know , book-em-dano , call-for-backup , give-a-hoot-don't-pollute .
what i told him to ?
... we 'll gettim in their cars .
hey taylor , you do n't know it but i saved your ass today . i killed a shit-eating dog .
what 's on your mind ?
you did n't do nothing .
other fuckin ' assholes like me .
hey , whaddya say something like that for ?
get on the horn with atlantic command . let 's upgrade the situation to defcon 3 .
i 'd prefer it if you did n't speak to me .
what are you down here for ? to see we do n't make off with any of mister friendly 's precious cargo ?
the oldest one . he was in an argument . a lousy ten-dollar card game . the kid pulls out a gun . it goes off . the kid gets killed . the grandmother hears it and finds out he 's been arrested . she has a heart attack . she drops dead right on the spot . now jeannie 's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor .
they just finished supper .
black sue , fat phoebe , rosaline , burbage 's seamstress ; aphrodite , who does it behind the dog and
i ca n't . what if it 's the wallaces ! ? we 'd get annie in trouble .
it 's not your time . i get time off .
what ? ... oh , no , thx . that 's not true . not satisfied ? thx , i need you so much .
actually , no , she 's a complete psycho . that 's why she 's up at pescedero . she tries to blow up a computer factory , but she got shot and arrested .
bela needs a job ... i ca n't even get a film going ... but < u > of course < /u > i ca n't -- i made the worst movie of all time .
i 'm trying . have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it 'd ruin things .
no . this is nothing , dewey . i 'll be okay . go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence .
a butterfinger wrapper .
i do .
yes .
so ... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you 're allowed to tell us that much ?
that 's how long you were gone .
now , where the fuck is my money ?
mrs. peterson .
what ? ! this is a class ride , johnson .
well , there is n't a literal connection , dude .
i mean -- working together . just like the old days . the things we 've been through , hildy .
what are you going to do ?
you done your math right .
you 'll regret this , mrs. little .
i 'm going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission . jean , can you raise me up there ?
because you promised .
let 's go -- we got to get away from this phone .
actual . terrorists ? well ... it 's only my first day .
then i will go with you .
enough ! never mind the girl ! well , why do n't you go ?
frances , you remember my lawyer , alma styles ?
i do not know him , but i have seen him .
`` harold , the patron saint of taxidermy . ''
holy shit .
i wish you 'd talk to me . we can figure it out , you know . we can figure it out together .
mr. scott , all power to the weapons systems --
-- i would n't worry , ms. jenzen : the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long . in the meantime , let 's all relax , have a drink , the evening 's young --
steve slutes , and he 's not a boy . steve could n't get arrested as an actor . he could n't get arrested as a boy .
so you ca n't tell me anything ?
you win , inspector . you win all along the line . why did n't we think of brandon before -- or did we -- some of us . yeah . of course you did . when a suspect thinks he 's safe , you go on letting him think he 's safe . wait for a mistake .
... so maybe the best thing would be to take care of that , right here in brainerd .
no it 's not the only issue . there 's another issue , for the jury . what about entrapment ?
obviously !
keep going ! ! keep going ! !
yeah , sure , you got lots a enemies in l.a. after what ? six hours ?
i want him bad . i do n't just want to catch him anymore . i want to hurt him .
i wo n't tell you over the phone . i 'm comin ' to n.o . and i 'll tell you then .
who 's this ?
you should probably hit the road . go home . this place could get hazardous for your health .
what cat ?
oh , no , man , look . look , you know , it 's me , okay ? i come out here and i 'm , so used to everyone , you know , kissing my ass and i think i 'm a fucking star , man , and i 'm really sorry if i 'm full of attitude . i , i really ...
it 's clear . they 'll do everything possible to make it fail .
it 's not my boyfriend -- and it 's not anything -- it 's over . really . it 's not . he wo n't came back .
you 're pointing a gun at me .
there -- you 're a new man .
you 'll have to pack quickly .
yeah ... sounds like the constitution to me . with a little of the bill of rights thrown in ...
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again .
i 'll do my best , madame , even if i have to work every night .
you can be gentle with him , elaine . he 's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden .
you know what they say about the early bird .
dirty business we 're in sometimes .
what happened to the walk and the nakedness ?
you have our cards .
no ... for god 's sakes , santos !
it 's my cloven hoof . it trips me up sometimes .
i do n't know what i 'm doing .
who cares about people ?
you gon na sit at home the rest of your life ? jesus !
i have here a discovery that will startle the world . it 's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a megatherium , [ 4 ] found in asia .
uh ... dill , um , face ...
yes . i like to watch very much .
i was a senator , you know .
i just said you 're praying ! are you deaf too ? i know you 're blind , because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here , you 'd have tears in your eyes .
but the other night ...
obi-wan has taught you well .
yeah ? give me a goodbye kiss .
no , no . i come every couple of years . i always think i 'm going to stay . i 'm from cape town originally
hold on , fellows -- i 'm not used to more then one question at a time --
thank you , mr. gillanders . thank you for coming down , in this cold weather .
and when i clap my hands together twice , you will wake up . do you understand ?
what are you looking for , colonel ? what 's your name ?
like this ... like this ... ?
what is this , rogoff ?
maybe i 'll tell you when i know you a little better . what are you doing tonight ?
but , leon , i am only here for a few days .
oh , am i glad to see you .
just stay out of my face until i 'm gone !
why are you asking all of a sudden ?
he 'll live through it . they all live through it . what a world , huh ?
gods of hell ! this must cost a fortune ! how many days is this going to go on ?
sorry . where is she ?
i 'm glad you came .
then take her to radio shack .
i had the impression ... from the model ... that the two planets were moving as one . that there would be ... a lasting darkness .
what 's going on ... .what are you doing ?
thank you very much . it 's a pleasure .
i 'm not a tweaker . i do n't use drugs . i never had .
i saw a man today , a man so hideously deformed who 'll spend his life in a hospital bbb ...
well , now , you just know all there is about bein ' a mechanic , do n't you ? i ca n't do unauthorized work . i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .
how ?
they never told me anything except my own role -- i had to find out the rest in the papers .
rose is displeased . mmm ... what to do ?
sounds like a bummer .
i do n't agree . no one can make a reasonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him . no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met .
there was so much going on .
take it easy .
mike , i got something special up my sleeve for these boys . you ever hear of & quot ; superman ? & quot ; and i do n't mean the comic book .
keyser soze
a human being , oh , good , i 'm relieved , i thought you were going to say you were a music lover . this man , this great artist has made anti-semitic remarks like you would n't believe . i got letters .
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
oh i do ... but i say i do n't .
you can trust me .
what is there to say ? they know what john bontecou is -- and if they did n't , they know now .
duncan . i 've got an < u > even < /u > < u > better < /u > idea ...
of course ! but that does n't mean i do n't need everyone 's support ! i ca n't be surrounded by negative energy .
nothing wrong with old age , frank ... long as you get there .
huh ?
no pain , no gain ?
you 're willing to die for this .
get me on the first shot , if you can .
i can do benefits
yeah , you would n't believe my idea -- it 's a home run . you ever hear of eight-minute abs ?
senator , you can talk all you want to , now .
okay , he 's just a wilbur then .
jos ? yero changed-up the drop plan on us . he 's grabbed gina .
i do . yes .
i thought you hated chardonnay .
now that i 've given you the overview , we 're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
what 's all of this got to do with me ?
yes -- she did .
i do n't expect anything , except to be left alone .
is it ?
no . she just would have loved it up here ... allison when i was under ... did i ever talk ?
i came to see how the investigation was going . i called and you 're not here . i wait up at the station and you do n't even show up ! ! ! i beep you - you do n't return my call . where the hell have you been ? !
she did n't push me into coming .
you ca n't threaten me --
who cares ? who cares ?
pull over , everett - let 's give that colored boy a lift .
you 're trying to get me to say something , that 's why you 're telling me all of this .
what are they ?
i think i 'm losing you .
cost less . that 's the point .
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before . as an android , i am in complete control of my neural net . the information contained there can not be forcibly removed .
perfect way to tie up a ... 'knotty ' problem ?
i have no idea .
you are direct , are n't you ?
you sure ?
soggy bottom boys - i do n't precisely recollect , uh -
you stopped smoking sixteen years ago , is that what you said ? oh , i-i do n't understand . are you joking , or what ?
i thought you could trick me for those tapes . do n't you get lonely in that little green room ? or let me get you someone ; i have terrific friends , wild .
you scorpios can never take a joke .
can i see you again ?
it 's not bad .
what happened to playing a hunch ?
you 're entitled to your opinion .
look , i 'll trade you .
till noon . this is on my own time . hi , shorty .
what are you then ?
why ? you 're the one who believes in nothing . screw the world , or whatever you said .
quellek . what are you doing in there ?
sure , all drifters do .
you do .
do n't mix very well with beer .
excellent !
you mean , you 're gon na --
oh great , i ran out .
hello ?
what a good poop you made in your diaper mazel tov ! that 's right ! mommy loves you ! such a good boy you are !
who the fuck is it to you ?
how long did you live here with your wife ?
well , dad , we have n't found any holes in the large bowel . they 've all been in the small bowel , but the smell is different . i caught a whiff of large bowel , but it ai n't staring us in the face , right ?
you know what ?
oh god , that 's great !
his wife .
tell me about it . what are you angry about ?
did i say anything ?
torpedo room -- ?
oh my god . i 'm sorry . i 'll let you get back to that . i 'm going to get unpacked .
beth , i ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how i 've always felt about you ... call me jam . it 's my band name .
you are beautiful !
enough .
what are you doing ?
you 're hurt --
is he dead yet ?
it 's building up with every breath we take . and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot .
oh , but this one is so simple .
did you say you were thinking about adoption ?
think of it ! in times like these .
let me see that .
do n't tell me , oprah did a show --
one hundred ... two hundred ... three ...
no you 're not . you 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake !
yeah , from boston .
sorry , dad . i would n't hurt you for the world . you know that .
well , i 'm one of your biggest supporters . i tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you .
and while you 're at it , i 'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads .
max . you threw my briefcase in the river . you 've got balls bigger than toledo .
come in .
let me explain you something , kid . stooling is when you rat on your friends , on the guys you 're with . when johnny needs a favor , do n't try to figure it out , just do it . now go ahead , join the congregation .
no !
she is . ah . here we go ...
somebody is imitating his m.o . look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman ; that 's how desalvo got in the door and caught them off guard .
relax . think about the 25 million dollars .
i 'm sorry , mr. baxter .
i do n't know ...
so , you got ta be a little flexible . look at your brother and me . larry 's not perfect , neither am i. but we work it out . we 're not unrealistic in our expectations , and we have each other . i think you 've got the door number three syndrome .
you know what i mean . you been givin ' me a goin ' over ever since i got in . why n't you go on and ask me where i been ?
what i was going to say is this -- would n't you be more comfortable at leith in a neat little house ?
damn !
you never told me why you got kicked out of ...
his blood ! it 's driving them crazy ! we have to mask the odor !
i 'll be in my office .
then who changed it ?
i 'm afraid .
good . it 's better if it were absurd . that would mean nothing much can be done about it .
christmas ? it can抰 be christmas ...
ah man , if you 're gon na bribe your way into a station , why not 17 with me and your brother ?
in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse ? the man is out there ruining lives .
you want the tapes for yourself . you 're going to sell them .
look at your reflection in the mirror ! !
i 'm not surprised . money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship . he has sold himself to vienna . let vienna look out for him .
you must be freezing .
who i am , outside of this boat . what the hell i 'm doing here .
i can imagine . you said you wanted nothing to do with this . you swore to me . `` do n't come near me . do n't bring this into my life ... ''
so what does that give me ? i 'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who ca n't play their instruments ?
i 'm sorry ? what are you oozing about ?
come , everyone , let us repair to the main chamber . project vulcan is about to begin . scott , are you coming ?
over my dead body ...
he 's probably outside . you know how he is . gets bored ...
universally rejected . strike three .
oh jesus . i 'm gon na be sick .
if they 're blocked memories ... i 'm starting to realize the reason why i blocked them out . allison i think i really ... screwed everything up .
the phone call , man . the phone call .
can you tell me how you spell ...
he 's at work while i 'm here .
i ride with fat-boy ...
did you say 'kill ' my sister ?
that 's some nerve !
you got no business snoopin ' around --
so , is this like a japanese restaurant ?
there 's just no way the mets will lose this game . gooden is pitching and strawberry is ready to break out .
but you 're not good at this . not yet . i 'm sorry .
smitty .
no . the fetus was dead . her uterus was virtually *disintegrating* -- my stitches pulled right through the tissue !
because they 're still here .
this is monstrous !
listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
hey ! hey .
i 'm sorry ... i just mentioned it in passing . i never thought he 'd use it .
no , i do n't .
no ! do n't lay your hang-ups on me , vanessa . you 're being very trippy .
yeah that 's it .
if you want to see us you must come later .
no ! not the police ! do n't call them !
earn your money . ... he 's ill , the plane is sick ...
so what are you gon na tell him ?
that kind of remark is pointless . now come on -- i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with , no matter how wild .
let me do the talking .
pull your motherfucking pants down .
andy , i 'm calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry . but -- i need your permission to fire him .
all of us are ... we are all britons .
... i mean , does it have to be `` goofy '' ? i was playing hamlet off-broadway two months ago , for crying out loud ...
that 's disgustin ' . those kinda sentiments should n't be allowed out in public . is this biloxi yet ?
you should know better than that !
how do you know he 's our man ?
and those lies she 's been telling ?
greetings , everyone .
it 's a beautiful boat , sir elliot . practically glows in the dark .
he was n't going to let us use it , so i just took it .
first you got to sign a receipt .
numbers ? no , never mind .
nothing ?
he 's sittin ' by the phone -
pauline .
big game fishing . sonar torpedoes . retirement gift from his friends at the cia .
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here , and i mean every little fuckin ' thing too .
if you want to go on , i can make it all right .
no ! if we land this plane anywhere else , we will end up another entebe . the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud , evades missiles and ... refuels in mid-air . call the white house .
why not ?
what happened to your neck ?
uh , thanks .
this is not a woman !
you sure you know where to find one ?
a .357 .
how quaint .
it is you junior !
phew ! we韛e got five minutes ...
orson -- we ca n't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot !
i 'll just shoot him once .
well , i guess i 'd better ...
where 'd you spend last night ?
wait up . you know the guy who did the weismuller through the window --
frank ... instructed you ... to get out of bed ... just before this happened .
you were demoted ...
yes , when i was younger i had thoughts about public office ... but i found , chauncey - that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen ... of course , my wealth provided me with considerable influence , but i 've tried , believe me , not to misuse that power ... it 's extremely important , chauncey , when one is in a position of eminence , that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country ... the temptations are strong , and i 've been labeled a 'kingmaker ' by many , but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people ... i have tried to remain honest to myself ...
insurance 'll cover it .
sure .
lawyer ? i do n't need no lawyer , do i ?
chuckie , what the fuck happened ?
what did happen ?
yeah , exactly . those 're pre-programmed course adjustments you 're looking at .
i can not believe this . it 's four- thirty , jim garrison . i have five children are gon na be awake in another hour and ...
now you know what i know .
well , i 'm happy for you .
nigger .
long enough to die . listen , if you really want to die , that 's your problem , but do n't do it under my nose , okay ?
that 's not relevant . an old car like this , it depends on the condition .
do you want me to tell you what it was like , reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing mecca ?
tyler ...
`` i want to tell you something , harriet ... ''
i think we should say some words over the grave .
mmm ... what are you doing ?
your bother is in america fighting the rebels .
when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean ?
he 's very interesting . for all his pretending to be a tough guy , he 's really got the soul of a poet .
never .
he just blocked it out . nigger 's crazy . he 's the one who did all the stabbing . he 's capable of some heinous shit . how 'bout him down there ?
i think you got ta hit them straight on !
i might get a shot .
you ca n't stay here . there 's snakes and it 's cold and you 'll just get sicker .
yeah . the place kept changing owners . finally went bankrupt . that thing in paris killed 'em .
what ?
oh , i know , i know , and you 've been wonderful since i was widowed . but mister hebbing has -- -- you do n't mind my telling him , darling -- -- suffered reverses . if he could ...
light and strong , light and strong , sure , why not , it 's only impossible . god save me from academics .
what the hell are you talking about ? what 's happening .
yeah ...
use the bathroom , because the port-a potties on the field are gross .
thank god .
give me another double brandy .
hey ! stop it ! i ca n't see .
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today . do n't you agree ?
he 'll be ready when you do . remember what happened at the apartment .
you ? no , you 'll be all right , so long as you establish an alibi for tonight .
what are you doing here ?
see ? you big dullard .
yes , go on .
someone from the past .
do n't go out of your way .
were you in cluett 's apartment ?
creasy ... wait .
... height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains . torso severed in mid-thorax , eviscerated with no major organs remaining . may i have a drink of water ? right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature . portions of denuded bone remaining . -- did you notify the coast guard ?
okay , get your clothes on . i got the cab downstairs .
my attorney , she 's just outta law school , about a couple of years older than my kid , for chrissake .
another mouth to feed ... you do n't by any chance know how to drive this crate ?
do i get to see it or not ?
who said anything about the catholic church ...
are you sympathetic to the former czaristic government -- the white russians ?
he just said ... that i 'd shock eugene and then things would change for him .
but it could be anywhere .
at my age , you tend to lose track ...
it 's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes .
with whom ? where ?
... keep them from that area , on grounds of relevancy . what , bob ?
slow down . smell that ?
yeah , why do n't i ?
and you were n't . as usual . what do you say to that ?
-- no .
no . we go .
i know .
i 'm sorry .
... what the fuck is this ... ?
i 've seen worse places .
no .
`` to the love of my life , love , doug '' ?
and that 's great . but do it in la and new york ! there you experiment ! show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage ! i do n't care !
yes .
surprised ?
absolutely . look at this .
lara , i do n't know why this is happening . i just know they 're setting me up . i ca n't trust anybody . i do n't know who to talk to or where to go ... lara ? are you there ?
just one person . is n't that so ? you know what this is all about , do n't you ? it has very little to do with whether you should play `` cora '' - it has everything to do with the fact that you 've had another fight with bill .
what are you doing tonight ?
i never thought i 'd ever see ozzy live until he was dead . please tell me you like metal .
you 'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset .
no really , i can stay a while .
she went to a waxwork party
yeah , why ?
it 's really nice of you to help us .
most assuredly .
do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture ?
when i read your work i felt that you knew me . women must tell you that . and this one in particular speaks to me , do you know ? i am genna . how many women must tell you that . and the script is wonderful . wonderful and lean and visual ...
you have an atm ?
wrong . all we 've got to worry about is ambrose . nyah will take care of nyah .
jack , i think i should get a job .
i 'm from all over .
just the man who 's gon na see you driven to your knees ! sheriff buell clayton from texas .
rather more than a little something , mr. mitchell .
well , at least you 're accomplished at something ...
that 's real cool , anthony . yeah , i wore boots . my parents would n't buy me any $ 200 running shoes like yours . i was n't spoiled .
spock .
give us a chance , dad !
uh , victor , i hope i have n't done something to make you think ...
no . you just looked as if you did .
you know , general , there is a gate of janus in rome which is only closed in time of peace . sadly , it has remained open for three hundred years .
what do you want ?
in case you 'd like to know , mr. bernstein , he 's at the huntington memorial hospital on 180th street .
oh christ .
no , i just told you what happened .

with love 's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls ; for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt ; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .

where are you going ? !
princess lili , godwin 's daughter . she was with me when calamity struck , but after i could find no trace of her .
but superman is n't an average man .
look , i just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name , if you could get it out of your system once and for all , then maybe you 'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real . granted , ideally , me . i did n't do it to hurt you . i did it for you . i did it for us ...
how we gon na break the curse without a prayer or two .

what 's the problem here ?
it 's a gift , richard . this law school is a gift from your brother .

i 'm sorry , we 're sorry , just checking out your fly laptop !

oh , great .
boys , boys ...
that 's a lollipop that , boy . the kid is only great .
down below , harry said we would all have to die . since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone . death was the only logical explanation . but sitting here , we still know . so how is that possible ? unless we make ourselves forget .
hey ... popeye 's chicken is ass kickin ' !
it 's a ghost .
they said send a detective if i could spare one . i can always spare you .

you can be replaced you know , chicky baby .
leon didn抰 hang himself , deborah . your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide . how did he do it , eh ? strangulation ? drugs ? no doubt an autopsy will tell .
the details of my life are quite inconsequential .
you got a punk-ass mouth on you , kid .
it 's odd ... when i first found myself ... changing ... i was sick with loathing and disgust . i thought i was so ugly i wanted to die ...
well ... uh ... thanks ...
what ?
only his doctor , dr. winkel .
and look who you brought with !
no problem for me either . honestly , it 's no problem .
rwanda-burundi . central africa .
you fired the cleaning woman ?
it is the work of incendiaries .
it 's right to the point . also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them !
wait a minute . get down off of there , augie .
oh , yeah , of course , dear .
what do you mean , dude ?
what about sing ?
i will do my duty , my lord .

it 's not your cup of tea , mama .
three hours ! just to heat enough water to wash this stuff ! i tell you something . if this strike is ever settled -- which i doubt -- i do n't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us . it should 've been a union demand from the beginning .

i feel like you 're turning me into a vcr .
i am not crazy , tyrell . he was right there .
that black car ?
you gaff with the < u > hook < /u > end . blood 's on the butt . where your hand goes .
nya-nya-nya !
nothing to tell .
object !
i 'm afraid not .
we 're locked on mig one . why does n't he disengage ?
i 'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting .
good night . and i am very grateful to you .
this is how i dress all the time .
was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to ...
just hold on ... hold on ...
where 's betty ?
no -- leave him be . it 's better for everyone .
no , that 's not possible , mason . the trout ...
good boy , port hole .
all right then ... seven 's always been my lucky number .
ally jones .
well , baby , i do , but to look at it from another angle ... there 's a < u > potload < /u > of money here .
okay , that 's not so bad , ah tim ?
he insulted billy . and then i walked over to him politely ...
what 's that ?
well ... they have to service the plane ... and get a pilot down to the field , unless there 's one hanging around there still ... and then they have to get the immigration officer ...
straight up .
you did n't take , did you ... ? you hear things .
now listen carefully . stan and kyle , you stand watch here and await my return . if any guards come by , make a sound like a dying giraffe .
hmm .
what do i get ?
that 's my business . -- now , it 's all right , daniel . what did he do ?
i 'm all ears .
maurice , man , shut the fuck up .
shit ! no one 's here .
known me for long ?
miles is different . he 's still so idealistic .
but , no , you 've been doing that all night ! you 're gon na ... you 're gon na burn a hole in your ... you 're gon na develop a third nostril ! really , do n't , please .
yeah , she 's the girl who drove the bus in `` speed . '' she 's cute .
grady ... oh .
this is what we 've been waiting for .
what happened ?
hello -- hello ! is this the lying -- in hospital ? did you have an auto accident in the last --
what ? no !
it 's been too long .
right , i guess those are the kids --
god yes , allie . i 've got ta say -- that was the ballsiest move i ever ...
and that 's the way the game is played .
... and let me say again for the tenth time ... ... you people were quite ready for the merger . you declared yourselves ... fully agreed on all the terms -- why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up ?
but a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies . people who will want to destroy it .
need the disk back !
... but then it hits the relay stations ...
so you decided to go to america .
i 'm sorry , skip . it 's this damned book . lawford gave it to me .
what 's your problem ?
liz we 've got to cancel , we have to put it off .
well , these ... women friends of yours ... all over the world . how does it work ? do you see some of them again ? do you forget others ? do you write them now and then ? how do you manage it ?
yeah - it 's all right ... let 's go .
put her on .
okay . great !
none of your business .
some of his solo stuff 's not bad .
oh , but doctor . the music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- that 's life --
we still have n't found a connection between the victims .
warn me ? will you get out of here , you meat loaf ?
where 's mary ?
you think ?
oh-jesus-mary-n-joseph , she 's pregnant ! if you are -- come back , sweetie . mommy wants to talk , then kill you !
oh -- could n't charge you for something like that . it 's free .
yes .
i do n't recall . memories of the war , perhaps .
< i > -- a bow ? -- but why ? -- how ugly ! -- what 's in it ? -- what 's in it ? < /i >
you ' new here , man ! see you , boys .
-- it 's for you , ike .
help me .
please just try to be your normal humorous self , okay ? like who you were before the tailspin . do you remember that guy ? people love that guy . and do n't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall .
inspired , ms. ivy .
yeah , and with me it was like i was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine .
you 're it .
it 's called journalism , fletch . it 's called getting both sides of the story . something you apparently do n't know anything about .
the point was to love each other .
harbor air , do you read ? over ?
i know what you 're thinking , she 's a hysteric pure and simple .
yet on november 22 , 1963 - the day of the president 's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 magnum . but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill . here , take a look at it . now , does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you ?
you 're it .
because , baby , you 're looking to find love in an institution , that 's your only chance ... .
i did n't see anything .
the `` real you '' .
life has denied me that thrill .
save yourself ... .
yeah . she told me . you walk her to school .
no , do n't tell me ? you just got fired by your crazy boss .
guess who < u > i < /u > am .
not from forty feet .
except for the last part , that one 's not bad .
... that 's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...
it 's like the basketball team .
no .
and they frighten you ?
fair enough . let 's go make a statement .
can of itself be a problem .
if he did n't want to go anywhere without me , how did you get him on the flight ?
that 's my capitalization on the annex ! *my* operation , ed ! christ almighty . that 's what i was just talking to doris about , a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann .
we 're all from the sea , mr. hutton . our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans . by continuing to destroy fish , man destroys himself .
you 're still eight pounds over . what 's the reason for this ?
good night , rose .
one of the fathers was on the tv saying , `` my child was not a bum . '' and it 's playing like gangbusters . hell , hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph .
princess , has it ever occurred to you that they 're < u > not going to rescue you < /u > ?
thank you , i can see that . try something else .
only kidding ... < u > actually < /u > i attacked you .
what 's a real denial ?
okay , now you want to talk about good versus evil ? well then let 's start with adam and eve and the snake .
you were right . it is my responsibility . the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me .
that he was .
she wo n't stop crying ...
what chip ?
it is my shame -- my crown of thorns . and i must wear it bravely .
what the papers used to call a `` gangland slaying . ''
oddly enough , i do .
guy 's a spook !
will you shut up already ?
a hit .
what 's your name , if you do n't mind me asking ?
we just punched it up a bit . made it funnier .
gerron .
there was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you ... you saw what you saw . we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged . what if there were a connection between the two ? the gravity waves , the hallucination , all part of an defensive reaction , like an immune system ...
yes ... after her death , it was intolerable for me here ... the future had to be better .
what about us ? what about me ?
talk fast . polls open in half an hour .
thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays .
get that for me , will ya baby ?
you told me that on the phone . what the hell are you doing here ? showing off your communication skills ? go back to your people and tell them when they 're serious to put a number on the table .
you 're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding .
wait ! you know we 'll never make it through the great barrier .
two hundred pounds ?
i have n't been able to get you off my mind .
i knew he would n't come .
do n't pull the green wire . pull anything but the green wire .
is that bug juice , or are you just glad to see me ?
fine , bob . how are you ?
... well , he got his mistrial , but the well had run dry . there was nothing left to mortgage ; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway ...
i 'm sorry ... that was an unfortunate choice of words .
cokes , seven-ups ... also some aspirin ...
max , the city is terribly worried .
i 'm an irishman , sir . an irishman is always logical .
you mean this sign ? the one that says `` no coloreds allowed . '' that 's a good question . ray , how come we missed the sign ?
all of you !
yes .
i 've never cottoned on to plasticine like you girls , but i enjoy making things out of wood .
i wo n't keep you another minute ...
it 's really `` f. lee montgomery '' -- but that gets whittled down to just `` flea . '' for short , ma'am .
yes .
you sure you can manage ?
according to our current information , the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector : gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent , the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction , a research project on gorik iv was halted due to increased neutrino particles , ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
peerless , your father called .
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room . i have ordered champagne . perhaps the baroness could join us .
i 'm not that crazy .
i wo n't take 'em . they never work .
yeah --
she did ?
adopted . i should have know . of course . if it was a snake , it 'd bit me !
you can see the outline of a butt .
do n't tell me now . tell me right before the test . i wo n't be able to remember long enough .
what ?
um hm . that 's right , maya .
i 've got you , keitel blacksmith . if you go ... i go too ...
was he there often ?
what the -- ?
gary blinker 's fulla shit !
well , you have your story , i have mine . i say i entrusted the money to you , and you stole it .
what do they have to do with this ?
yeah , you are . i can tell by the way you look at me .
why do you do it , laura ?
congratulations , brother . i 've been waiting for you .
your sex life ?
none . call it a hunch .
i 'll expose you .
a right fair mark , fair cuz , is soonest hit .
and i still say you stand up and i 'll stand up with you .
a neighbor saw your car leave .
my court , i go first .
it 's killing me .
scales were oval . it was an < u > asian < /u > crocodile .
do n't worry , i 'll do it in my own subtle way .
well ?
not now .
sometimes it 's the only solution .
three . the last one was manager of a finance company , back home in pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts , but he asked me to wait for him -- he 'll be out in 1965 .
do n't worry about it . it 's been a long night . speaking of which -- you owe me a cup of coffee , remember ?
you might make henry happy ... ... sure , i 'll do it .
of course . what are you suggesting ?
uh , i could n't reach the guy ... he was in meetings all day . but this 'll be great , i promise !

it 's a plan -- -- _ 51 .
this came for you a couple of days ago . olive asked me to bring it . with everything happening , i guess she forgot .
no .
only minimum security .
if beynon bought him out , and he talked then maybe beynon 's boys will be waiting for us in el paso .

what 's your plan ?
what ?
thanks , mr. carpenter .
no , this is my first trip , doc .
uh-huh .
you need help .
yeah . he did n't like it one bit but at least he 's letting me stay in the play . of course , he wo n't be able to come . he 'll be in chicago on business . but i think he 's gon na let me stay with acting . as long as i keep my grades up .
no and i do n't plan on sticking around either . i do n't guess i 'll be seeing you again . take it easy .
we do n't have a choice !
what happened !
he personally asked you to ?
now , remember -- keep it simple .
... including me . right ?
but you must come in .
what is it ? what 's there ?
daddy ?
i did n't mean to bite him . he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and ... and i bit him accidental .
agreed !
it 's like traveling back in time .
i know that .
people who want to bend the rules ...
what i just said ... y'know , people afraid to say things ... .no guts to say the things that they ... that are real or something ...
there 's an old saying , `` first customer of the day is always the most trouble ! '' but like i said , i 'm in no mood for it so i 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you wo n't have one human reason to give me ...
you do n't like it , do you . i think she will accept , but i 'm not sure . she may be too dependent on her brother .
can i help you ?
well that 's what hospice will take care of for you . they will send a nurse , someone who can take care of all of that for you --
i 'm sorry . i 'm just so happy that you 're safe .

to prevent a murder . sooner or later , he 's going to contact you .
i need the id to fly with my gun . the gun belongs in quantico .
you like it ?
hey .
maybe we should take a little nap , see what happens ?
no , uh ...
jeez , ray , fourth and forty , throw the bomb .
goulash .
we watch ... good fun ...
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ?
of course ... it 's wonderful .
police corruption . it 's everywhere .
ten thousand dollars .
alexander ... i know you .
why the fuck you at home ? cause i spent ten thousand dollars gittin ' your ass home . look , i got ta problem . i need help , and you can help me .
oh , just traveling through , huh ?

they look like a bunch of good ol ' boys to me . i guess it 's oil money , huh ?
fine . show me the body .
yep ! right on it !
yeah , you told me that later .
i want to work , miss lady .
taking it down the hill .
machines do not eat message .
and you notice i 'm not in the army anymore .
what are you talking about ?
it 's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people .
ah ... er ... it looks as if you 're taking me .
where are you ?
four dudes sneaking in ? we 'd get busted fer sure . bad plan .
i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green .
since he was born .
good .
what 's the matter ?
sure . it works . i mean , look at this face , daniel . i 'm thirty-eight years old !
i lost a good cameraman in australia last year . a great white chopped him in half with one bite .
doing what ? sir wilfred tipping the scales . ruining that delicate balance between good and evil . i think that our mr. lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it . there 's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being , containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form , and feeding him the soul of a believing victim , you can bring him back to life !
i ca n't leave when i 'm so close .
well , you take a meeting with him , i 'll take a meeting with you if you 'll take a meeting with freddy .
that 's right . -- rubbers , too , i hope ? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency .
not an easy day to forget .
maybe i should come back another time .
antonio paid for it .
naw , i 'm carryin ' it !
you said speak czech !

in a casino . as a croupier . a dealer .
yes .
yeah .
okay , jacob , get up and sit your ass down on the bed . make a wrong move and i 'll shoot you in the face .
your color .
what ?
why not ?
i believe he is unwell , ma'am .
what 's your record at ?
well , everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself , accumulate a nest egg , and so on .
he 's a regular whiz at it . that 's all he did when he was a kid .
i do n't know where he is .
we can call our ambassador .
not the drugstore !
and thank you for dressing up for us . this is very classy . tell us . what kind of professional plans do you have ? what 's in your future ?
yeah .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
unlikely , but even so , she still ca n't go out with you . so what 's the point ?
a homosexual encounter .
stacy ! i 've got water in my ears . do you have any q-tips ?
big deal paper hanger ! hell , anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks . like breakin ' open a piggy bank .
pomona ! you 'll be in the car the whole time ... look , let 's make this easy . i have a spare bedroom . it 's not huge , but the kids would love to have you at the house .
it was n't his fault . nobody said anything about seats . we --
who the hell are you ?
i am ?
well , i 've come to never expect greatness from a cab franc , and this one 's no exception . sort of a flabby , overripe --
have you seen this ?
welcome to the hotel earle . may i help you , sir ?
it was n't toontown they wanted . it was my idea of how to put the land to better use .
i 'll tell him . by the way , i 've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional .
we thought you were gone for good .
why not ? you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary ? is jean-claude done yet ? *
-- teddy kennedy ?
let 's not confuse things anymore . i 'm archer . you 're castor . but if you need proof --
it smells damp .
... beating out the other papers , chasing girls ...
they 're inured to it .
local lawyer for dominican dealers . off to buy a half interest in a mall in granada hills on their behalf .
sean 's awake .
she has reason to be suspicious..does n't she ?
do you have any idea what 's going on out there ? the phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city .
hello ... ? who is this ... ?
oh , better not , walter . would n't do any good .
sir , i 've got an idea , let 's go around .
would you like a little clam-dip , honey ?
and he carried you like this , i suppose .
perhaps . but on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device ' of some kind , i plan to be very far away from your lovely texas when it is activated .
he 'll barely be able to sit up .
'certainly . and little johnny ? '
i 'd say there 's about , oh , fifty thousand dollars here . what would you say ray ?
he 's done . he 's dying .
i 'm the man .
it was one incident .
i do n't know .
mayol ... mayol ... no reservation .
deadbeats all .
why we 're just standing here .
you 're a loser .
yes , yes , happy to meet you .
you will go to palace there .
it 's a full moon . where is he ?
boss , i got all the time you need .
i left it in the tent , sir .
now hold on , baxter --
tell them that everything is going to be just fine . it is up to the children to save themselves these days . because the parents ... they do n't have a clue .
oh , you 'd be surprised . they just do n't have their doctorates , that 's all .
i will prove it to you . come swim with me now , vincent . now -- tonight .
then teach me how .
i think he owes more to you . but that 's not important now . i know what 's going on between you two .
like what ?
i told you this would work.. by setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he 's in virtual reality . he still thinks he 's in the real world .
you like chagall ?
excuse me . you seemed like you were in trouble .
the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester . try and get in close over the harvester ... you 'll find this interesting sire . -- the duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester . paul can see ...
listen to me . we 've got to get help . the killer 's here .
and the hell with it . it was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed .
but why did you tell her ?
d'you want me to order one for you ?
sorry ... i was distracted .
then let 's not name the thanksgiving turkey , okay ? i assume you still got a shiv .
not if what he left me was real .
it was a lot of fucking money .
sweet .
last one to the midnight star buys .
lovely .
i have to help him !
no .
i 'm cool .
thanks ... .
but you do n't look very happy .
okay .
do n't worry ... ... and i 'm actually the district attorney from ignoto county . just another good american like yourself .
there is a greater risk in staying here , you know . if you do n't find the princess , then the whole trip was for nothing ... was n't it ?
wipe 'em out ?
it 's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they 've done something wrong ... or the level of what they 've done wrong .
have you seen what 's happening out there ? the terror , the despair ? the world is on fire , ellie . people need something they can believe in , something worthy , and you can give it to them !
dr. monnitoff ?
yes . not like enzo .
that 's that 's that 's that 's beautiful ...
yes , sir , i think they maybe . i think `` jennifer , '' and this lady got hit by the same guy ?
but the setup 's there . it 's there now .
yeah , well , i 'm flattered , but you wo n't find any real meat in them .
hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch .
nobody was watching ?
cleo !
and i 'd end up a widow in two ways . let 's forget it . i 'll just be a little more careful next time .
sit-and-spin . alright ... why not ?
not a boast , sir , but a curse . never have i met my match in joust or duel .
it 's a mistake to think that .
if it is freedom to represent people with limbs that do n't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose . anatomy ! heaven forgive you . you must have studied with a sideshow of freaks !
i love it . i just love , love , love , love it .
downstairs , i know . pensioner 's terror ordeal : page six .
technically , yeah , but people have made it back after as long as three minutes .
how 'd you do it ? the new you .
sure ...
is the baby okay ?
oh , miss price ?
it 's you , norman . your fear of drowning . you have to face it .
yeah ... so what ?
liane , this is a preliminary ... you did n't tell her we were taping ? what did she think she was coming to new york for ?
well , it 's the funny man . give it here , package boy .
so , you think you 're gon na find his scalp hanging in some tepee ?
they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon . if you 'd care to come back ...
ever try forty sleeping pills ?
there 's nothing there now and i do n't get any significant readings .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector . the cell is for lack of a better word ... perfect .
like we told you before , we think he 's into something with the king pin --
it 's a frame-up ! some imposter !
thorgan , pull us in .
they said he 's a drug dealer .
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune .
no . you ?
what if you do n't wan na be found ?
ass !
he lives here in washington , does n't he ?
great , or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels .
i 'm sorry . you 're right .
let 's get him over to the bed .
francesca ?
what ... ! --
life is so goddamn wonderful , you almost wo n't believe it .
that 's a picture of me in japan .
i know , it has n't really hit me yet .
you just seem to know all these things about me and i do n't know anything about you , you know . what kind of music do you like ?
we do n't need a bed , do we ?
you wear them of course , silly .
you have a very good mind , or i would n't have come back . that mind is now asking itself , cleverly and fairly , `` is harold ryan really a clown ? '' and the answer is , `` yes . ''
yeah ? well why do n't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out . but take my advice . put a little more life into it than you usually do .
but i am also with the government .
i do n't gamble .
done ?
that won抰 be an issue , believe me . i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant . no offense .
fourteen-thirteen market . get a signature , then take it to this address ... by the way , that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already .
my life sucks .
yes am .
does n't that tell you something ? !
oh no , i would have done that . but i would have made sure i killed them , too .
is n't he incredible , gets along with everybody .
no ! we not like to hear it ! go to your room and shut up !
you 've sacrificed ? ! if you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents --
are mom and dad here ?
but , in particular ?
we 're partners , are n't we ?
i know . i 'm sorry .
i do n't know what i 've got .
i 'll ride ahead . nelson , protect the queen ...
don ? are you in with them ?
going back , huh ?
vulcan ?
those comics -- they never got the eyes right .
i 'd thank you -- but i 'm not sure that was a compliment .
no , no . they 've got to be puglia olives , packed in a light brine with a flavor that does n't overpower the palate .
it 's just ... did he ... what happened in the basement ?
so ... you hang out here a lot ?
rocks , sand -- those two men who deserted .
well , you did n't marry her .
does it tell me how to get laid ?
what 's that ?
bollocks . you know what you can do with that watch ? you can stick it up your arse . slide of nude woman in bed , a man at the window .
yeah but i 'm serious .
claire ...
it 's cold , david , and i 'm so alone . the undead surround me . have you ever talked to a corpse ? it 's boring ! i 'm lonely ! kill yourself , david , before you kill others .
let me hear you say that ! i so unhappy she runned away that i killed myself -- that what happen here , ai n't that right ?
as you have been robbed of your purse , may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home ?
interrogation is one a my specialties , but undercover work is my forte .
i was so confused , so conflicted , so ... unstable .
what ?
the hell i am .
yeah , i 'm here .
you ca n't do that , baby . it ai n't right .
in life ? i'ma keep on living , having a good drink , got me a good young woman , make a couple of dollars and make people laugh . have n't i always tol ' you all nigga 's are entertainers ? the question is what are you gon na do , peerless ?
like i said , it was nothing . do n't bunch up .
take it slowly .
what expenses ?
well , well !
how about bari ?
that 's their problem .
we are both full of shit .
i want a job , giles .
i must insist , sire .
he 's a stroppy sod but he 's got more balls than a golfer , only he does n't know it. ' * cut from completed film .
an inevitability , i suppose . nyssa was not among them , i trust .
verona again .
still ... you did the right thing .
you get to be a little chelsea clinton . everyone wants to meet you . party with you . have sex with you .
i do n't know you ...
that is true . however , i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse . for thirty-four years i have endeavored to become more `` human '' - to grow beyond my original programming . and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor . this emotion chip is the only answer .
thank you --
dwayne -
there 's still a big spot on the floor .
mom ... ?
come on by .
you 're not so bad yourself .
want some free advice ?
*i* was with her .
do you know that house ?
arrest you for what ? why would we arrest you ?
i do n't know -- i mean -- i was n't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious , really -- what you might call a lovers ' quarrel --
you fucker , do n't you ever touch lula - you fucker , i 'll kill you .
you got it , dr. argon .
you really think eddie killed her ?
i 'm not dealing .
law school was a mistake . getting this internship was a mistake .
pure nonsense . this wo n't prove a damn thing .
you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men . and yet you 're able to remain an outsider . with the concomitant air of ... superiority ?
do you recall the school motto ?
what ?
i know . that 's why i 'm attracted to you . i mean , you make me nervous . you 're intimidating . maybe it 's my curiosity/self-preservation thing , but all i can really think about right now is kissing you .
some people do it for for their lovers
heard of harry lime ?
what happened ?
you love to pose so much , let 's see it again .
i just want to listen .
did you just say `` girls ? ''
mike , because of the earth 's rotation we 're only in line with vega so many hours a day ; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations . if dr. arroway had n't moved quickly we could have lost key elements .
you sure you do n't need any help in there ?
just the same .
i want to know where scully is .
who 's kathy ?
well , i-i do n't think it 's a very good idea .
personally i think he has a deep , almost pathological desire to corrupt you . but i suppose that 's a type of love . i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me .
these are their leads , their sources . i want you to have your reporters ...
what ?
i talk to her or you can forget about it .
he likes to read ... did he mention anyone in particular ?
the movement !
did you see his face ?
oh come off it , mare . what about what's-his-name ... steverino ? you could 've at least passed the baton on that one .
it 's me , you dork .
what the hell 's going on out there ?
are you okay ? what happened ?
i used to bring over ten thousand at a time . that 's the legal limit , so i never brought more than that .
you certainly can . especially if you 're me between now and tomorrow morning ...
i seen on the tv where that do-gooder asshole 's gon na go visit sick kids at three-thirty . children 's hospital , on the double .
i ca n't tell . you 're stomach 's in the way .
christ , george , joseph reed 's been writing letters back to congress attacking you . your own aide !

bridge washed out梐round dawson .
good night .
mkay , kids from all over the state have been brought here , because you all share the same problem . uh , young man ... let 's start with you .
they 're gon na kill her , walter , and then they 're gon na kill me --
trigger .
the park dude was missing an arm .
i would n't say that -- what would you like to have for diner ? there 's onion soup and canned asparagus --
what are we gon na do ?
morton hull , the producer of 'this evening ' just called .
sure . i finally pulled a run on my old man 's credit file when i was seventeen ... only it was too late for him .
i 'm going to see you again , right ?
rats ?
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built .
why do it ?
hey .
yes -- the *benefits* ! what 's a man called taylor got to do with this ?
i do know to a certainty . and you know what 's going to happen now . you should admit your situation . there would be more dignity in it .
it 's a good , honest business , is n't it ?
tracy .
you threatened miss swann .
but wishes do n't come true .
no .
is what you said about the ring but another dream ?
he could ?
i 'm glad .
for cottonmouth . goodspeed and the s.e.a.l.s exchange looks .
where is your luggage ?
you really think so ?
of course i can . i can say all sorts of things ...
the things a girl has to put up with .
nothing .
yeah , i 'm gon na start sleeping here . masry & vititoe , can i -- damn it . does anyone know anything about these phones ?
oh ...
doc ! how the hell are you ?
like an elephant .
well , let 's not jump to conclusions ...
yeah . no more . i 'm finished with that shite .
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten- - and you 're going to be on time .
it looks that way .
come on , laura . i 'm your best friend .
rush your mouth , girl . no , he did n't . he can not be that big of a damn fool .
-- if your life 's so good up there gena , what are you doing down here ?
red label .

det . bradford , i 'm sorry but we do n't allow gum chewing in this house .
hey , how ya feelin ' , mickey ?
roofs ... towers , palaces ... spires ...
for some fuckin ' `` sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives ... ''
and ... ?
yeah .
beautiful but dangerous . once you see it tainted with blood , its beauty is hard to admire . it 's 400 years old .
either you 're european or badly brought up .
me ?
i had a partner and she fucked me .
this is n't happening .
i 'm just playing around .
that 's cutting it closer than you know . what about team two ?
-- no ! i ca n't go along with this horseshit ! just tell them they can fry me !
do i know hans hinkel ?
can we move it to a different orbit in time ?
i 'd kill ya .
cut my hand . hit by a vampire .
naturally you have copies .
yeah , they 're in the snow .
no wonder you 're my prize pupil . what about you thomas j ?
i have this thing where i have to know a person is being honest with me before , you know , i can feel completely free to be myself .
quaint ? ca n't imagine why .
well , how 'd you get here ?
you 've earned it -- the horse ranch on the toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham .
ok , but remember that they wear it because they have to . i wear it because i want to . that 'll make me look different . let 's get a drink .
if i do n't kiss you , i die anyway .
no way . i always do my own work .
i 'm - afraid i have some bad news for you , reef - you 'll have to share quarters , this trip .
it 's amazing there !
mr. nixon .
if you do it like that it 'll open in the fire . then you 'll get burned and die .
... into a monk ...
it 's downright classy is what it is .
then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect eugene and isabella for as long as we can .
never . but we have to hide out for a while . lay low . say . . . a couple of years . by then i 'll have a new plan .
not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not . the police know you brought the car into the country . this makes you an accomplice .
no , your mother did , then i did after she passed .
i . i do n't know .
oh yes . i remember everyone who was on the lakul , every face . even the ones who did n't make it .
now , look . i 'll give this money to the colonel just as soon as you get started . we 'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you .
how are you going to find him ?
mom 's expecting you for dinner tonight .
will it hurt ?
you saved a lot of lives , you should be very proud .
what ?
what ? oh yeah . coming .
no , you know what ? it 's not you , man . it 's not anybody . it 's me . whoo ! hey .
like i fucking care ? i 'm not just sitting here !
i 'm good .

and what did you say ?
tonight ? you 're whacked . the timing 's off , i 'm underequipped damnit , i have a date !
we want some grass .
and , what 'prize ' do you see ? what could we possible gain ?
hmmm . as you know the bureau -- and mr. hoover -- is particularly `` sensitive '' to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left .
same thing that happened to you -- i stopped poutin ' there on the sidelines . got in . got on the team . i joined the working week , you slick fucking asshole , so why do n't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy , paul .
then you 've got it . if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands , you 'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot .
sure .
why do you think they let us in on the `` deal '' ?
does he stay with you here ?
well , then , how about a ruler ?
uh , i think they have .
all right , bruce , what do you suggest ?
is white meat all right for you , mr. shea ?
it put you here . i 'll admit it , it acted like a god and put you here , put you into my consciousness . i was asleep , and it put you into my dream . i saw your mouth . and there you were . whether you 've been sent here to make me happy or punish me , it does n't matter . the decision we make now is all that matters . stay with me .
the things that get you excited .
i do n't know . he was disappointed in the world . so he built one of his own - an absolute monarchy - it was something bigger than an opera house anyway - nurse ! say , i 'll tell you one thing you can do for me , young fellow .

how 'd you meet marsh ?
how 's school ?

i want children .
ok. i 'll meet you back there . do n't leave until i get there . lock the door and do n't open it except for me . ok ?
if you wo n't sleep with me this time , benjamin , i want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we 'll make some kind of arrangement .
what do you do ?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point echo delta . doyle takes us out by helicopter , we all live happily ever after and that 's the last time , rambo ! i swear to christ .
you could have poured coffee in starbucks , you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings , you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet ... you could have been one of ten thousand things ... but in the end , you chose to protect people . you made that decision ... and i find that very , very interesting . now all i need is your credit card number .
now when you talk to her , i do n't want you to be the guy in the pg-13 movie that everyone 's pulling for . i want you to be the guy in the rated r movie who you 're not sure if you like .
for chrissake give me a hand !
welcome back , sir . how was the vacation ?
it 's going to be fine . it 's going to be ... you remember in 88 , when ...

sweet talk me all you want , i still want my hundred-forty-five dollars .
i 'm sorry --

sure you could , in wildwood , new jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you would n't have much left over for decoration .
mm-hm .
yes . that 's true , you 're getting a hell of a reputation .
no . mace is in this .
yeah ! tell me which one you would like . to be doin ' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls ? be straight up !
why should you ?
and bateman , what are you so fucking zany about ?
he , he , lives in south america ... he 's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he 's real busy .
just sending a message . she 'll get the point .
how do you do ?
mr. scott , how soon can we get underway ?
get a hold of yourself ! you are way out of your jurisdiction , now come on ! calm down ! do n't make me sorry i let you come !
that 's because he knew . he 'd seen these files and knew .
what is that thing ? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk ! ? . '
hey , mister joker , have a heart , bro . it 's friday .
i 'm well connected , roy , cole introduced me to a lot of people . very valuable . valuable for us .
ca n't thank you enough , ross ..
i do ... christ , what happened to us ?
i 'm getting rid of the animals . i 've lost interest . besides , they 're standing between you and me .
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i 'd just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker .
oh , stop worrying . he 's all right .
i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she 'd be happy and i bet she 'd stop picking . they make mush out of him . just mush . one thing i know is i never want to be like him .
explanation ?
mm .
welcome back , night owl .

liza sutton is dead .
john , it will not be easy .
it was n't like that .
i thought you were out of town !
yes , we introduced ourselves at the door .
my guess is there is n't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring , but we should do a blowup of this anyway .
not the bible ?
sir , yes , sir !
i know .
curse you for breathing , you slack- jawed idiot . mother 's love , jack , you know better than to wake a man when he 's sleeping . it 's bad luck !
dinner 's in the warmer . tell your father i may be late .
ok , dudes , follow my lead .

every night , penelope , for the past two years , i 've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight .
sure , go ahead .
well how do you feel about him , then ?
they froze your accounts . get outa my way .
is it me , or are you this nervous around all women ?
you 'd really do that ?
we need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second .
perhaps the truth is you do n't really trust anyone .
his law firm , same one that hired me . israel walked out after he made bail and nobody 's seen him since .
so ? be real easy .
no , thanks -- i never gambled in my life .
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles .

i 'll try to slip out . if he quiets down , passes out ... i 'm afraid he thinks ? well , he said you were a buffoon , barton . he becomes irrational ?
aye , sir ; thrusters ...
oh , heavens , no ... but ... she is going to be at the ballet russe tonight ! that 's the russian ballet - russe for russian , oh those crazy french ... they only go to see which dancers will defect .

i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl .
you were n't expecting me ?
total delirium .
i do n't believe you .
what for ?
i 've been aware of that for some time .
you have your nerve ! here , boy ?
do n't give him anything .
ehhh , you know those guys . if he had his way , i 'd be stuck in the hospital , running tests all day . and anyway , i 've found a new guy who 's gon na be able to instantly remove the cancer .
torch it ? !
ms. pomeroy ... what 's going on ?
you left your husband 's side ? you left your brother 's wedding ?
popcorn ?

that 's great . just terrific . you talk to me with them on the phone , right ? that is really smart . and , you do n't tell me ?
well , it has n't happened yet - has it ?
yeah , i sucked his cock .
... at her request . she was a very religious woman .
she broke up with her boyfriend . listen , babe , we needja back . you got ta follow up on the jumper , find the human interest in the grim , unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis .
what 'd you do to your hair ?
he fell . hey , fella , you fell . is he all right ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't . i ... .
how did you get into the business ?
we 'll have more fun in detroit .
divide and conquer .
i do n't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .
it 's true . there 's only one king ... people need to be reminded of that . nevertheless ... jeanne has done so much for us ...
oh , i know exactly what you mean . i sometimes enjoy puttering around myself , such a pleasant way to forget one 's troubles .
are you hungry ?
it ca n't be possible .
as their cloak begins to engage , their shields will drop .
in the closet . i do n't understand , norman -- why would they call you ?
my pleasure .
that makes him more than a hundred --
so what are you thinking ?

we shall miss you .
seltzer ?
we felt his presence .
let me tell you `` scary , '' amber . look at me . do you wan na look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age ? i 'm a `` lifer '' here . best i can hope for is to end up in a descent `` raisin ranch '' where they 'll change me twice a day .
better than you getting killed ! do n't touch that gun ! daddy says --
no .

to the hotel . to register .
nothing ! he can marry who he pleases . i do n't give a damn .
what 's the matter with you all ? have you lost your sense of humour ?
it hit me ! where are they ? !
did we lose anybody ?
the kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here .
nevertheless --
and you 've decided to get < u > married < /u > . you 've decided a < u > lot < /u > of things . but , in spite of your decisions -- you are still `` nagged '' by feelings of : < u > despair < /u > , of < u > failure < /u > of ... you still have the < u > nightmare < /u > , you ...
it 's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and does n't have to take any time outs .
i did n't say .
there 's another possibility . a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage .
yeah ?
i know . it 's like coming from the moon . or mars .
what kind of dancer ?
now you 've done it . you 've given me nervous indigestion . anything else bothering you , boys ?
all right ... lem me see ... okay , new burger king opens up . these assholes get excited and start lining up . like it 's some five star restaurant . the place is mobbed . right ?

tuna .
well , you 're not too busy to know that the governor has n't signed that reprieve !
me ? nothing . i 'm the one whose ass he kicked . i 'll tell you one thing , though . i do n't think he 's gon na have a problem shitting in school anymore .
a boy comes to the door .
who 's in back ?
you love him , do n't you ?
that 's 'cause i sticked my *own* knife in the wound -- after she go , i sticked my *own* knife in there . i poked it all around , i just tryin ' to find the same place she got me .
you wan na knock ?
hot ? i 'm freezing my ass off .
he has a very powerful ship . perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
y'know , uncle frank ...
hello , alan .
i know i can bench more than that !
ask , you 're the girl reporter .
no . no thank you .
you know what gets me ?
thank you for seeing us ... we ... just felt that it was time to discuss ...
i 'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow . the patient 's rooms are down here .

i 'm sorry , sergeant major . there was n't anything i could do . shadow gets crazy --
so what do you feel like doing tonight ?
yes , dudley . i am .
yeah , man . let 's throw a bachelor party with drugs , booze and broads .
the message you left .
i have no idea . maybe someone saw and talked .
your secret admirer ?
all hands , brace for impact !
at least i 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig .
she 's the mother . that means she 's within her legal rights .
recognizers !
you know something , orson , you have n't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met . but , ya know , i 'd do it again in a second .
why not ? you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid , were n't you ?
work ? start learnin your letters again ?
frances , i 'm warning you ...
next time , it might be the fbi . the time after that , it might be the president . but it 'll always be someone . count on it .
a vampire with a human soul . an immortal with a mortal 's passion . you are beautiful , my friend . lestat must have wept when he made you --
they 've got lives to be grateful for .
nope .
i was with valerie , i swear . this is adrian 's work . i 've got to find him .
little less .
but , never mind . i am thinking we can do much together . this problem with diego , the stolen car , the jail , is very silly business . to release him from the carcel , it causes me much inconvenience . the fifty kilos could have been a big problem . and i do n't like problems .
did you cry when your father died ?
do you know who that is ?
miss , would i be prying ?
promise .

`` ... but still it rises up ... it rises up , frank , high as it can go . ''

sensors , captain ?
oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i 'm just fine .

you sound disappointed .
the corleone family , senator . we called it , & quot ; the family. & quot ;
where are the minefields ?
ah-hah , i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go --
daddy , i got an idea . now just hear it out . i know you do n't like to use any of the boys on these jobs , but technically , vic ai n't one of the boys . he 's been gone for four years . he ai n't on no one 's list . ya know he can handle himself , ya know you can trust him .
lay back , mack .
he said ... take his right arm .
mr. treves says that you are in the theatre . do you live there ?
reverend mother , i just wanted to congratulate you .
if i give myself up in exchange for sophy , would you make sure she 's okay ?
and maybe paul . what about the murderers ? they 're in there !
no ... this is the first time for me , too .
jimmy ! that 's why the court exists . the court does n't exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice .
i mean it -- you got enough money now . head out for california . surf 's up , jack , and you 're digging wells in the snow .
did you know --
this the load you lost a while back ?
funny situation , ai n't it , andy ?
please , do n't mess with me right now ...
as i said , in every way . physically and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you 99.4 .
where 'd y'all go ?
i ca n't talk to anybody right now , ca n't you see i 'm busy ! i ca n't talk business . hang up . have a drink . get her a whiskey .
as smart as you are , you 'll need a little help .
a tragic story , no doubt . how 'd you get up here ?
yes , sir .
he is a behemoth .
there 's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen . when the servant comes in , mr. hallor , i 'm going to ask him to show you to the door . many people do n't know where it is .
because you have to leave half an inch at the tip ? to catch the force of the ejaculate ! bateman i 'm getting out of here . where 's your lithium ?
driver !
i think ... i think ... that 's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would , uh ... not only be a violation of international law , it would be ...
you know i thought you 'd left me back there .
please ?
how about family ? got any family ?
i did n't choose him as my deputy , mr. president . you did .
now that 's all right , barton . everything 'll be all right .
do you have anything to drink ?
i should kill you ... if it 's true you should die ... i should kill you now !
daddy put the wheels back on . i 'm gon na fall .
is this your first job ?
okay , honey , come on out of there .
you can !
everything . it is a ghastly existence .
your predecessor . he did- n't like to get outta bed . catch you later , freddy t ..
how you doin ' , boy ?
mrs. mulwray , it 's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law . it 's a felony .
the state police .
have you seen him ?
naw , i ai n't .
i was just thinking ... there 's something special i want to talk to you about . i think it 's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship . a deeper level .
what do you want to see a doctor for , huh ?
they ca n't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked , can they ?
no , not at all .
are you in love with her ?
come on . i 'm not gon na go if you do n't come .
oh ! how about `` under the sea ? ''
you got kids ?
what kind of show is this gon na be ?
mad ! darling , there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off . i love you for some of them - and in spite of others . i have n't let those become too important to me . they 're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you 've got to keep your teeth sharp . all right . but you will not sharpen them on me - or on eve ...
call-girls generally keep a book , you know , a list of their clients . sometimes , if a girl retires , she 'll even sell it worth good money . jane mckenna had a black book ; when she died it was stolen . i 've been after it a long time .
i have met her . what is your business with me ?
i 'm not making it any worse . you are . me and jill could 've worked this thing out . it 's normal , it 's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it . believe it or not . how do you think this makes me look , treating her like some tragic victim or something ?
but i do n't want to go , i am enjoying it .
but , hey , some good news . this last one put me way ahead of schedule . we 've actually got some time to kill . jazz ? you like jazz ?
i sent telegrams , i guess the military traffic held them up .
the fucker shot himself . ker-bang ! that 's what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental .
beggar . we 're at a disadvantage with outpost . our experts are n't as smart as theirs . sometimes we ca n't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly . we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights . i 'm taking a shot in the dark , here . i can offer you 32,000 a year , a buick . i 'm hoping you 've got a feeling it 's the right thing to do .
so what ?
willard ...
if we do n't get that pint , he 's in trouble .
that 's where we came from first .
yeah . dinky-dau , that 's me . hey , co. you wan na meet jake the one- eyed snake ?
this is my jurisdiction . i want these men as much as creasy does .
what do you say , jake ? should we trust her ? no ? i did n't think so .
they killed her because she found out .
around .
good god !
just missed deleon . hayes is up in the squad .
i know .
then we 'll earn it together . here , take mine .
the sun will be low , almost dark , the air cool and the bank will almost be closed . 5:45 . 5:50. he will put the rifle down , he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank .
you calling me a liar ?
i 'm not certain about ...
< u > no < /u > . no , that was too easy --
i like you , ted . you know that . i liked you before you were filthy rich .
i understand , sir .
a million deaths are not enough for yueh ...
heh , what a hypocrite .

as soon as i met him , you knew i 'd say yes . he makes julia real for me .

doyle . joey doyle 's ... . ? ... .you 're his ... .
well -- marylin and rex broke up and ...
you gon na get that --

but how could we ... at a time like this when we just ... well , let 's at least first have a look around the other islands . could be that something might turn up there .
when you call me gabriel , i know i 've got trouble .
yeah , you and debbie and perfect --
safest place in the world . you think vince would look for you here ?
do n't talk nonsense . give me the bottle .

so one day we 'll meet .
cheers .

the tough part 's almost over for you . i mean , my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest .
right here in church ?
yeah , earl warren ?
thank g-d. i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man .
control tower , reading , sir .
without you , my dearest , i might have died without ever knowing love . inexpressible love ! god of nature ! bitterness than which nothing is sweeter , sweetness than which nothing is more bitter . divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes .
what should we give him ?
now .
excuse me , gallagher . i would n't miss this one for the world .
i know this ai n't easy , lula , but i ai n't gon na let things get no worse , i promise .
i do n't know .
you 're probably just having a mid- life crisis . did you buy a porche ?
... check ... ?
well , i guess we 're not a very proper family .
what , you 're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor 's daughter ?
and they always want to cast their buddies -- it does n't even < u > matter < /u > if they 're right for the part !
because he 's out of shape .
parry ... i 'm jack .
total control now . tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas , two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible ... stoned , ripped , twisted ... good people !
what are you doing ? !
i suppose i could stay , just until she arrives .
when i was poor , everybody doubted i could make it . when i got rich , everyone said , `yeah , but he 'll never keep it up . ' now everyone says `he 's killing himself . ' so i clean up , and then they say `look . his art 's dead . ' i do n't take drugs , anyway . i 'm healthy now .
i want the < u > same < /u > drink . cause it did me < u > good < /u > ... but i already drunk it , so , barring that , yes , i would like another .
not embarrassed .
kill him .
that 's where my boat 's moored .
it was great seeing you again . i 'm glad you dropped by .
yeah . me .
this has to end .

i 'll explain everything later . can you meet me tonight ?

reporter ?
nancy have any severe childhood illnesses ? scarlet fever ? high temperatures -- concussions ?
telephone . i suppose you do n't know the phone company killed kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they 'll never let that happen . they control everything : what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end , and --
well it 's pathetic , is n't it ? i mean to a guy from new york .
my heart ca n't take much more of this . look , if we climb down from here , it 'll take two hours to get back to the station .
those are cold .
goodbye .
i said let me see your hands now !

i see . and what 's strasser doing here ? he certainly did n't come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency .
what ?
yes , i am . there 's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor . why do n't you go down and read some magazines ?
yes . tell me .
i 'd like to talk to you , if i could .
when are you coming home ?
why do you need that much ?
you want evidence . i 'll give you evidence .
the children ... ?
i , i must apologize . i-i 'm , i-i 'm sorry . i 'm so mixed up .
i want my lawyer !
i will .
-- so ?
ja ?
something the matter ?
why , what is tybalt ?
look , sweetheart , i 'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
hello ! . . . yeh ?
i still ca n't believe it . how does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission ?
what ? it does n't work that way .
a for effort , nick , honestly , a for effort and an honorary degree . i 'm surprised you never escaped from the mountain .
or you can quit .
yeah , you betcha ...
feed , mostly . thought we 'd get something for the kids .
i think everybody at the store knows that already . they always talk about it . maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you ai n't allowed over at the first baptist church no more .
i do n't think so . the membrane in his nasal passage did n't show any sign of long time usage .
sound a little what ?
yes梚f he is your husband .
no , i do n't want to hear anything . there are things between men and women that will not change ; things that have been the same for thousands of years . you are my wife , and they are my children ... and i love you and i will not let you leave , because you are mine !
someone 's bringing in a kitten ... ?
i 'd love to , but i 've got an open house today at the ressler place .
and i mean ... that 's no good .
no , dad , you got ta tell 'em that they 're back there .
i do n't know if `` we 've '' noticed , but the sickest runs this side of the alps are < i > right outside that window < /i > --
-- then i guess then it had to be you . sorry .
i 've talked to doctor emlee , and he says ...
yeah ...
how much ya wan na bet ?
it 's not that cold . here , let me wrap it .
dad , i 'm trying . the chairs , they wo n't scrunch .
sure .
it 's free to all .
what are you going to do ? charge me with smoking ?
a seven .
no . what is happening ?
why did n't you just shoot them ?
no , just stand there ... lem me look at you a minute .
sha la la la that ai n't no crime .
hey , be nice to it , it 'll be nice to you .
would you please repeat the destination ?
how can they do this ?
kirk to enterprise . damage report , spock ?
can you tell me what their names were ?
his snapples were in alphabetical order .
can you handle one of these ?
stay put !
all that animal fat . i feel it in my pores or something .
yes .
how can you drive ? james ... your legs . you can barely walk .
yes , i do , will .
calm yourself , bones .
data , are you all right ?
so , in other words , you are not down .
`` burma run '' because you fly over burma ...
it 'll come to you . see if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started . save us all considerable embarrassment .
yeah .
... the case with anyone . and i 'll meet you tuesday , and we 'll go over your testimony ...
beni ya little stinkweed , where did you slink off to ?
i guess he was n't too popular at the end there .
here 's hubley . left quarantine on november thirtieth , relocated first to riverside , then moved to los angeles early in february the following year . field of expertise : chemical manufacturing . looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery .
who the fuck is this ?
and , what about us ?
christmas came early .
you know , there 's , like , this rule . we get to go home at 7:55 .
i have n't seen you since the wedding , jeez , you look great .
you 've had it . i 'm gon na get you .
hey , that 's great , henry ! good thinking !
you 've got a generous nature . i like that in a person . my name is max .
you 'd never understand !
i mean , you will try to push it through , wo n't you , mr clark ?
what 's that supposed to mean ? ...
you are his friend .
i think i 'm going to stay up for a while .
uh , look ... if you 're serious about wanting a job , picking apples is n't that boring .
exploring . in the woods . many years ago . -- i was a solitary child .
he does n't remember . he woke up at the zoo .
do you think about their wives or their families ?
friday 's the drop-dead date on the offer .
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking ?
wait here .
i do n't know . he moved away .
and our world will do the time warp again .
having a gun pointed at you for one . it 's not like breaking a mirror bad luck , but it 's bad . three on a match , black cats ... believe it . believe it all .
i can imagine . but you did say you came to me as my friend -- that you were concerned for me .
the last resort ! quick !
device .
the door was closed . it must still be in here .
that 's no battle , kid ... they 're just sitting there !
ya catch any fish ?
no , why do n't you take care ot it ?
do n't want to film this ?
oh . yes . of course . i should have thought . you should n't have to ask . that was thoughtless of me . yes . wait here ...
alex .
yes , of god .
could i have that in american ?
funny thing , you mentioning money . i was just about to ask your for some ...
int . vitelli 's helicopter - day .
i do n't know . my fax said `` have a good fright '' .
what do you want , vic ?
alright , we 'll do that tomorrow .
as usual , you want everything your way . except this time there 's more than your damned ego at stake .
no time . get him up .
principal 's office ? yeah , i guess i can swing that .
why do n't you come in , too - you 're a writer ... might interest you .
oh nice save .
i can believe that .
how can you tell that -- from here ?
nearly four .
no .
you know , i 've been living here for almost three years . now in three days it seems as if i know everybody . when i pass people on the street i want to stop and say , `` listen , i got a fella . ''
how do you know she did that ?
is that what you think ?
let me see .
hey relax , i 'm not gon na break it .
she knew about it , jeffrey . she knew you were going to try this .
exactly .
your problem is you take the easy way out . losing is easy .
okay , whose window did bud break when he was playing with his father 's golf clubs ?
he 's coming in . i feel safer already .
gus , have you ever been in love ?
i do n't know . i was just curious .
i 'm not with the agency , mr. garrison , and i assume if you 've come this far , what i have to say interests you . but i 'm not going to name names , or tell you who or what i represent . except to say - you 're close , you 're closer than you think ...
potatoes . he does n't want me to eat them -- and naturally i do n't want to upset him .
you mean this is -- goodbye ?
get out of here !
no , the very same one , my boy . he recovered from his wound . the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him . it was only made of tow . do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family ? the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way , for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you . but hit him you certainly did , roderick , and with a fine thick plugget of tow , and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to . we told your mother the story afterwards , and a pretty scene she made .
i insist . there clearly is n't room for us all , i 'm the least able to dig , and i 'm not one of the walking wounded . those are facts . besides , if i remain it 's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he 's doing and rescue us . it 's hard to argue with this logic .
those busts up there -- all around the wall -- who are they , sonny ?
lock 's busted .
he wo n't complain . he can pay off some of his creditors .
you do n't like her . you only met her for two minutes .
was there something else ?
oh , so you did give her ten thousand dollars , eh ? and there are letters ...
... m ... m ... my , my , my , my goodness -- i can talk again ! oh -- oil my arms , please -- oil my elbows .
coming for you ...
no . i ca n't really see it .
you all want to lay off ? god . i hope the iraqis shoot me ; put me out of my misery .
oh , listen , i understand that there 's always a risk ... you know , i might have to take a loss somewhere .
how cold ?
as i 've said we had some more ...
it 's marty on the coast -
what should you have known ?
yeah ? what do you need ?
-- mr. sheldrake .
i know you 're in a hurry , so i juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes .
it 's a rapid prototyper . i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull , than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints , one layer on top of the other . it 's the future of paleontology .
i just need a place to lay low for a few days . come on , i know you hate me but you ca n't wan na see me at the bottom of the east river ?
what happened ? what happened ? who did this to you ?
tell you what ?
not even close .
he 's making a fine recovery .
it 's a trach ring . it 's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box . this one came out of a sixty-year-old man .
i told you this was a sweet set-up .
-- otherwise we may have to --
he 's supposed to be flying in from europe .
no , sir , it 's not .
i just recommended you . you still had to prove yourself .
the puffins and the hawks . we 're in extra innings . the hawks have a really good line-up this year .
you 'll probably have them the rest of your life .
they 're back !
sure right now ! you 're darned tootin ' !
fish ?
never mind the law . cathy , you can start serving the soup .
we 've got some paperwork to take care of . pretty soon . do n't worry , you wo n't run into him in the parking lot .
in the hospital . i was kind of excited about it at the time , but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers .
tough spot .
what difference does it make why i do it ?
i 'm not sure if i can do this .
oh , i do n't blame them , really . i guess i have sort of made a mess of things . these folks have to protect their investment . most of them are very nice people --
no . thank you . i抣l be fine ...
this one walk you home too ?
here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning . they 'll be ready on saturday .
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots . i 'm not going to lie for you .
yes , jimmy
you live a phony cheap cop-out existence .
with everything that was going on in my life , i just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- i needed time . viktor bought me that time . i owe him so much .
maybe you did it yourself .
g'bye , ms. sindell .
make it nine hundred . that was my best week .
thank you , herr doctor .
not that big .
i 'd say we 're in its home .
it 's fun dancing with your eyes closed . i 'm floating . i 'm floating ... .
ergo ?
but does n't jacques dive without anything ?
you like me . i like you . i guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone .
pamela landy ?
are you crazy ? ! you ca n't do this .
... just a second here , i 'll give you a receipt on the , uh ... whoa , nellie ... oh , by the way , we did n't talk about this , i , uh , i think i 'm gon na call the place tolliver 's , after me , you know , i did n't think you were much interested in , uh --
but where did you finally end up ?
i 'm doing a piece on skybolt . i hear macmillan 's meeting with him in nassau .
i try not to drink at lunch-time . makes me sleepy in the afternoon . you like to keep a clear head , eh ? one soda , one whisky . i do it anyway . no will-power . got a busy afternoon ?
well , george , i invest for a lot of people . i make a lot of money for them . more than they could do for themselves .
i 've read scripts about detectives , but never met one . must be wild .
just a minute , maxie . somebody ...
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
though they are strangers , they are at least entitled to a christian burial !
oh .
... and my crown does n't fit and ... really ? ?
hi .
do you know where she lives ?
i love you , margie .
and the beast slouches towards bethelem .
she does n't have a rolodex .
why , it 's just like air , is n't it ? when i grow up , i 'm gon na smoke like a chimney ! i 'll be eleven tomorrow , you know .
how so ?
it was gracious of you to share it with me . good day , mademoiselle , monsieur .
well . that was brilliant .
technothugs ?
please , ed .
-- he 's running from the cops , he 's got a bag filled with god knows what , he 's in the building and i do n't know where ! --

prison custody ?
you ...
have a damn party ! call morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off . i 'd like to show that fuckin ' karl to the guys . they 'd get a kick out of that . do n't you know they would .
what can you tell me , young man , about the various flavors of `` frozen yogurt '' ?
aw , er , it 's just a bunch of hot air . i had to say something to get in the door .
oh -- oh , miss flaemmchen . it 's you --
oh ... well ... have you heard from barnett ?
it never ends .
agent desmond , it 's ...
do n't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we 're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .
and you --
you mind if we get out of this guy 's brain first ?
bought it .
i do . how do i look ?
dogs got no reason to live .
that 's three things .
this door was open just a minute ago , was n't it ?
i think i should go home .
that 's why i 'm here .
everything 's going to be beautiful .
half of them are mine .
senator geary , i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state . i have made that state my home ; plan to raise my children here . the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars ; why would i ever consider paying more ?
i do n't know , i do n't know ... i just know we 've made too many enemies .
erev shabbas . i ca n't drive . i 'm not even supposed to pick up the phone , unless it 's an emergency .
when the left hull goes , so will the right .
it 's miller time . let me go give these koreans s'more business .
maybe he ran out of ammo .
must have been the redman . a lenape indian lives in the western woods .
thanks -- whoa , professor tripp , careful here ...
oh , dear ! has she done something wrong ?
not here , fran . ca n't we go some place else ?
rick , please .
... me ? well , you could 've saved yourself the trip .
you keep your nose out of my life , young fella .

what do you have to buy ?
i know that , lois . and i wish he were here . . .
shit !
they were all wearing hardware .
she 'll be here in a moment . she has a special surprise for you .
they getting older now and i ca n't take care of 'em like i used to . more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night . now , i do n't want to quit these people but they ca n't have all my days and nights too . i got my own family needs me . it 'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day , then earn a little something at night , how 's that ?
i did n't want no turkey anyway .
where do you send them ?
it was an earthquake and it was dark . i have no idea .
did you hear what he just said ?

i almost had 'im .
eh , what 's all this ?
jacob . we 've got to get to amanda before it 's too late .
but i do n't know love ... i 'm like a machine programmed to save other people 's lives but never to have one of my own .
right , right , cross with the left , spin and turn !
thank you , leo . and call me max . you know , i do n't let everybody call me max . it 's only people i really like .
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers .
sit down .
yes . so did my father and my grandfather - we 've all had this passion for shells - that 's why we named the oil company after it .
are you drunk ? you invited me . and my horse . here he is . ottavio !
c'mon , i 'll give you two a lift back to the bijou .
i do n't like cake .
what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't know what you 're going to ask me questions about . you may ask things that i wo n't want to answer .
all right .
you know , you sound just like a boy who 's never --
see that , son ? now this is a heel , see , and there , that 's the ball of a foot . someone has been walking here .
not much to tell . nothing really happened .
how 'd it go , son ?
you will await your orders like everyone else . unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday 's little excitement .
evil , powerful beings - i have their power only if i contain them , control them . if they should all be released at once ... well ...
it 's a lousy fifteen kilos . i piss fifteen kilos .
well , i did n't do it , did i ?
maybe it 's harder for them to say it than they let on . at the very least , they believe it 's in our best interest . and at the end of the day , they may end up being right .
listen to him . little lord fauntleroy !
how can this be ?
you work for me . i 'm not comfortable with -- y'know , `` us '' ...
i do n't know why you 're so weirded out , this is not san quentin , it 's just a nuthouse . most of these people do n't even know where they are , they 're not gon na hurt you .
because you need to understand . and you need ... to be careful .
you better go get 'em .
listen -- we know you 're involved in this -- we 're going to get the story , why not help ?
< u > yes < /u > .
you 're incapable of the truth ...
all right . finish the job . let 's get outta here .
... make plain the last resting place of the most holy grail .
no ! well , well , well ! that 's all right , if you like it . can anybody do that ?
easily spoken ...
your eye .
i got it . i just do n't got it on me .
julie ...
old howard winton 's cub ?

i thought you were the guy who did n't like to lose control of his emotions .
red deer table ! what 's with you , man ?
drew 's aboard ?
hold your goblet with two fingers .
for what ?
what do you want ?
we played with a code using < u > the new < /u > < u > york times < /u > obituaries . over three years we played twelve matches . i never won .
what about her ?
we 're all special . everyone lloyd and i chose for the class is special .
the good old days : toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch .
she would say she knows enough .
yeah .
are you a fan of henry james ?
true , but thanks to you , we know his weakness . we can keep him contained . it 's just a matter of time before we hunt him down .
a few minutes faster , we might 've nailed him .
a woman should never learn to sew , and if she can she should never admit to it . close your eyes .
i 'm not sure .
it 's okay , stanley . it 's alright .
who ? the jerk who 's running your life ?
i hope you do n't think i owe you anything . because i do n't owe you a damn thing .
... you know me ?
uh-huh .
no ...
... you shoot a great game of pool .
but be reasonable . if i do n't do something to stop her she 'll try again . and maybe hurt you .
good for you jimmy .
it 's just carpet .
do you know what i 'm looking at robert ?
and i 'm sorry for you , too , sidney . you 're going down with the ship .
he 's drunk .
ah ! the lady is armed .
indeed we are . we 'll continue the interrogation there .
slow on the curves or we 'll fly off the tracks !
yeah , but i do n't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . just between you and me梩hose things give me a stiff pain .
sneaking up on me , eh ? why !
do you ever perform out here ? i 'd love to see you .
dad ...
i love you too , and i do n't want to lose you .
who 's shooting ?
twenty years have passed , wade . lay it to rest .
you lost my money ?
big ed抯 ? big ed抯 tires ? why ... ?
you might have mentioned you had that .
i 'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?
everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line . sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something .
why should < u > i < /u > kill him ?
anyway , claire slept with him ...
cool .
no . the deceased is ... henry pekurny .
your only hope .
no , i had to seal off a whole section . we 'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door .
yes . but it was n't really . it was just ...
please . why not ?
they 're not gon na let us in vada , we 're kids .
i always did .
some people like it .
congratufuckinglations . that makes you last to go . but do n't worry , once the others are dead , it 'll come back for you . always does .

he took away the woman i love and he took away my memory . he destroyed everything ; my life and my ability to live .
wait now . where do you think you 're going ?
not so sure about that . letter of the law , you know . all the injunction says is no picketing by miners .
that was one of them ?
c'mon ... you 're exaggerating . the orders were to shoot him in the back .
i want what 's mine , half the money . we get rid of mickey , no one else dies . no one . say yes , i understand .

guys who 'll come after her . guys who 'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend . they 'll want to make somebody pay . maybe she 'll try and make it you .
i never use mine . but it 's a good thing to have . just as a threat .

he did n't shoot it , ross . and no way by accident . there 's a flash-burn . it was point-blank .
and gives it to you .
sounds like another one of your stories to me .
greek citizen . merchant navy . obviously we are n't the first to come across this ship . they probably stumbled across it just like we did .
if you do n't mind a suggestion , you might try a saliva test .
i 'm going with you .
... -tana .
i 've thought about it for years . i knew you 'd come . and i knew if you did - you 'd never leave . am i forgiven for sending for you ?
they 're asking for it .

is it the same heaven , or is it a chinese heaven ?
little miss , do n't you never come here alone . you gave me a fright , you did .
reading dirty comic bocks . and you admitted it ?
santos ... where 's j-j-johnnie ?
i forgive you .
yes .
mmnun .
now what ?
trust me on it .
what did you say ?
maybe not . but you know more than i do . you know something about this box . something about a statue ?
come on , winston . we ca n't quit now . the holidays are coming up . it 's our best season .
i ca n't split them .
dad ! you can talk him into anything !
very small pay , i imagine . i 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer . say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
give him the card .
tell her i 'm eating .
alex-
good , keep your weight off that leg , mr. gardiner . in fact , it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two , if that would be would be possible . since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs . i can promise you the finest in care , unless , of course , you would prefer to go elsewhere .
best time for banal chit-chat .
not since you broke into society .
double a. new britain .
what was ?
um , paul . on second thought , can you do me a favor and pretend i never said any of that .
and then i got scared , george , and closed the doors . i . . . i . . . i . . .
you know ... they 'd probably ask to see your driver 's license before they hired you .
well , these are slum kids , i was a slum kid , everybody talks like that .
you did n't ask a question . you made a speech .
the ... silver ... mike ... award !
is n't that hard to keep up , in the long run ?
here .
sorry .
what the hell is it ?
i feel so < u > close < /u > to you ...
this wo n't be an ' interrogation , just a ... friendly chat to kill time .
oh well he must be a surfer .
i'11 have to pass , al . and it 's not an age thing --
the governor gave me his word of honor he would n't interfere . two days ago !
of course , yes .
i wonder where he 's going now ?
got a warrant ?
her name 's hannah .
there 's no economic crime , you know , but there's-there 's ritual , religious- cult murders , you know , there 's wheat- germ killers out here .
i 'm their ride .
but , faith --
not yet .
the weather . i see . keep me posted . i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions .
t-t-thanks alice ...
if everybody agrees , but to make a roast takes four hours .
from interpol ?
a tracer . you 'll like it .
mr. kazuzo sent me .
this morning . i found a note in the kitchen .
it 's not nonsense .
and like in a game of chess , you 've played every possible move in your head ...
justin ?
that fucking bastard ! that fucking sick fucking bastard !
mr. yow ? oh mr. yow ... ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car .
see you tomorrow , truman .
just forget that . forget what it says in the book .
you 're not gross . why were you wearing a sheet ?
you know , everything you asked me to do i did . i call you for advice about shari you say - `` leave her be , see other people for a while . '' you just wanted me to get involved with jill because it made for a better show .
well , go tell her it 's me , okay ?
i dunno what i 'd do with your help . i 've got ta take her out of there ..
this is a great pleasure .
the scar .
who the fuck cares ?
hey . what are you doing ? how are you ?
it will be hardest on spock . soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood .
my god , we tried to save her ... you ca n't know ... you ca n't know ...
do n't do this to me ... .
i 'm sorry .
you 've got enough people kissing your ass .
sign of the dead come back to life .
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here .
mm .
would you ? actually , you could .
which we do . but we can stop doing that .
yes .
he says he saw you in a vision some time ago .
what ?
from my father . he was the tribe 's shaman .
oh great . could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here ?
yes . i might not have been shot .
you remember miriam ... .
who ?
i do n't doubt it , mr. stanwyk . actually , my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by alan stanwyk , who i believe is your son .
that 's your job . just keep driving , keep moving . no stopping . we 're sharks . we stop too long , we die .
i remember harry always trying to help someone . he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house .
fella named beaumont . they have him up at county . it started out drunk driving , but they wrote it up `` possession of a concealed weapon . '' dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him .
what do you mean ?
please ! please ... ? i have n't done anything .
tyrell , you are an unstoppable force of nature .
what kind of `` stuff ? ''
girls ? you call those skanks girls ? !
no , you see , i < u > promised < /u > them ... i have to ... i have to go and ... .
those fools and their torches ! do you have any ointment ?
what are they , please ?
there 's some weird shit here .
except that there 's no bed , is there ? and no breakfast either .
whose rooms are those ?
you may keep the pearls -- i do n't want them any more -- i 'll make you a present of them .
hanna ? who 's the new yardman ?
yes ...
i do n't get it .
what you readin ' ?
well , i do n't care who she is . we ca n't sing without her !
if you get injured , you get nothing .
i 'll give you fifty cents .
uh ... none just now , but ...
lucky you .
see , we 're very busy . a tv network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show .
exactly ! i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses . turns out , the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is : someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible . that 's it ! if you do n't do that , nothing else matters . the cars , the clothes , the houses ...
who 've you told this to , lenny ?
not this time .
well ... yes . if it had n't been for hitler , he would n't have had to leave europe . we would have been ... european .
ai n't that something . the mad monk of manhattan . here goes nothing . listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion .
my pleasure .
no , i suppose not .
jerses -- tomorrow ...
damn . gon na be another hot one today . sometimes i do n't even want to get out of bed . course do n't want to get out for the cold one 's neither . then of course the clouds come in ...
well , maybe i 'll surprise you .
this is a sign ! someone 's coming to take buzz away from me . i do n't know if you 're the guy or what , but i 'm not letting it happen . i 'm leaving him first .
you did n't transform them , willow , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .
i never won an oscar .
you threaten me with my uncle ? after what i 'm doing for you ?
could be this .
i 'm not fifteen .
it 's me ... i just do n't want this to be the thing you 'd do over . this pageant 's your ticket outta here . i know you can win , amber .
you hold great hope for this meeting .
another kind of game ?
if you mean sex , you could n't be more wrong . rose likes those boys and men , she has love in her heart , and that is what they want . it 's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her .
i do n't think so .
did you try ?
i do n't have any idea .
hey .
i work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk . i try to help them figure things out .
i 'm sorry . this thing has just knocked me silly . how long do we have to wait for this police character ?
you were ready to bite that guy 's face .
she just turned off her light .
no , i was , i was , i was just < u > learning < /u > on , it 's a ...
she 's down . help her ...
ah , doolittle , i do have a malfunction on this readout , but i ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is .
godless buffoons , all of them .
i 've been following this guy for years . i 'm your best shot .
damn it , nuwanda . you idiot .
patrick ? i ca n't hear you .
i 'm not going back there . i do n't even know who you 're talking about .
is that why you did n't write anything else ?
why do you keep calling me , jeff ? what do you want from me ?
but miami pd was n't part of the j.i.t . and from what alonzo said , he did n't give you up .
that 's why i 'm calling , miss price ...
look over there . that 's the eye in the sky room .
does it hurt ?
the last time was a chuck e. cheese party a year ago . he hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and did n't come out .
you 're going to be late if you do n't hurry up and change soon .
six martinis .
i believe he is probably lying .
sir ?
rollo ! how'sa boy ? i was just thinking about you .
and do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings wally brown is in ?
i need its matrix coordinates , dixie . i 've got to nail that thing where it lives .
a tractor beam ...
yeah .
ah , you must forgive me , my dearest marie-louise , i saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at schonbrunn .
is that what you say to people after death ? `` goodness that 's awkward ... ''
and we 're here on the couch ...
i do n't think so .
you must believe me .
how do you mean , start ?
other than me .
i do n't wan na talk about it .
you ca n't trust those guys .
who you workin ' for ? what do you do for a living , dickhead ?
i think i 'll kill her .
... got off the phone with his dispatcher . what an asshole . cabbie 's name is max rilke , been driving that cab for ten years ...
you think what we 're doing is so wrong ? and what are you doing ? pursuing goodness ? for what ? to answer to some supreme tribunal ?
well , i 'm not having any . even if it 's not poisoned . i do n't think it 's right . it 's not patriotic .
n'it 's a crying shame . but you < u > staged < /u > the oscars ...
what are you doin ' here ?
so one of them got to him .
yes i 'm sorry .
are you sure there 's nothing else i can bring you ?
what does it say ?
yes ... oh , yes ...
man , it gives me the creeps . we got no business towing a ship that size anyway . i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway .
kenny . it 's over .
all right . after they put you away ...
what ?
she 's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone .
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life .
i thought you said what's-her-name 's brother was going to fix it .
there seems to be no secret about that .
oh my god , what is he doing ?
i 'm sorry , your voice .
is tim there ?
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago , we just hit the jackpot .
do you know how she found the apartment ?
you 're playing an angle , college boy . you 're getting something out of this so you do n't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who 'll hate your guts for snitching . if they 're making you a detective , watch out . some bureau guys are gon na burn in this and you 're gon na have to work with friends of theirs .
come on . he 's a crook .
shutup ! i want nothin ' -- i ai n't no charity case ! get outta my house !
the guy 's a fucking asshole .
is this him ! ?
let 's go to the hospital .
remember when we froze your semen , you said that if it looked like you were n't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever ?
some layout they got here . did you get a load of the rooms ? you could n't do better at the ritz .
yeah ... something .
but we can get to the west side faster .
and they sure ai n't from the neighborhood . figure sabu 's in there ?
quite so . quite so . and you , my little friend , my little marie antoinette . it is kind of you to be present .
that 's the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take .
i do n't think we 're ready .
my husband 's here for work-he 's a photographer- and i just came along ... i 'm not really doing anything right now , and we have some friends who live here .
not so loud .
you 're not safe on your own .
yeah , most likely .
i 'm saying they came into my yard .
i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets .
both . now .
yes , sir . but what about the disks ? if the cops end up with the disks , we 're gon na see a whole lot of heat .
yes -- uh --
if he does it 's his own fault ! but i 'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh .
eddie , i 'm just a small-town girl . i 've never done this before .
you really do n't get it . this story gets filed . every time anyone writes anything about me -- they 'll dig up these photos . newspapers last forever . i 'll regret this forever .
do n't give it to me . do n't !
ex-cuse me ?
i 'm sorry , baby , i 'm just not grocking your head space .
what --
enjoy the day .
yeah .
is it , jerry ? you ask those three pour souls up in brainerd if a deal 's a deal ! go ahead , ask 'em !
no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that 's all . let me go .
no ... i mean ... i mean look at these . i 've got to lose weight , i 'm a blimp .
she 'd aspirated vomitus into her mask ...
it makes me sad .
are you wasted ?
too old .
screamer .
how many others killed ?
great ! the government 's putting dough in too many places *now* !
what do you want ? why are you here ?
what the hell is that ?
i sent for the police . we can explain .
you sold eight mountain view ?
really ? let me ask you this . what is love ?
but if he knew we have so little time -
you 're suppose to teach your children what you know . junior , i do n't have to worry about . babe brother is a different story .
hey !
you want to rent a movie .
all stop , sir .
rheya , i am not going back . i 'm staying here with you .
no .
frightened .
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row ...
i emptied it .
what is ?
good evening , anna .
the expensive kind .
where are you ?
they 'll come around . close your eyes , i wan na bring out the gorgeous color in them . the first rule in applying eye makeup , is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow .
the 6 horse is last .
it 's your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons .
you fixed my suit ?
do n't . it will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great unhappiness .
i do n't want to cause any trouble .
you 're outta your depth here , miss darrow !
that 's what he told you , huh ?
good job your lot showed up when they did or it would 've been < u > me < /u > for the high jump .
crafts .
why do n't i feel like celebrating ?
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed .
do n't know , only saw one of 'em . camouflaged . he was there ... ... those fucking eyes ...
what ?
a small price .
he 's tanking on us ...
i was too old .
mom , this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . the guy you yelled at for no good reason ...
who is it ?
admiral on the bridge !
what 's wrong with making friends ?
i think we 're making a lot of noise .
he 's right , kathy .
no . u.s. wildlife is on their way .
luke , i 'm coming along to do what i can , but i 'm tired and i 'm depending on you to get us through .
a few bars !
you talk of dignity ? after what you 've been doing ?
val , we 're going to have to forget about the truck ...
give me one minute .
why you ? how come the rest of us have n't seen these people ?
but i gave it to you !
lighten up . you 're going to give yourself an ulcer .
pretty much so .
forget it .
sorry , honey - he just happened to tag along .
you will ?
what questions ?
well , do n't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix . they may get the wrong idea how you found out . 'bye .
hmmmmmmmmm ?
doorway ) and who 's that ?
neither do we .
i lack the authority , buckaroo banzai .
showing you what ?
well , do you think dr. becker would have any idea ?
do n't be afraid !
something made this happen , billy . mr. stephens is going to find out what it was .
bill cox is goin ' to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin ' up shop early .
okay , look , i 'm delivering this to a man who 's going to give us the key to our job . but it 's pointless to try to explain it yet . you just have to trust me . i do n't have any more secrets .
thanks , governor -- *yes* ! do you mind ? his head -- ma 'll take the tail .
at this point we do n't have much .
they did not receive the money , you nitwit ! they did not receive the goddamn money . her life was in your hands !
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground . our hands are completely tied while they 're in the air .
mmmmm ...
my guess , too .
i do n't know man . i do n't know . that reminds me . another little donation from the police .
what plan ?
who were you really trying to kill last night ?
can we talk about something ?
seven o'clock .
we will release the hostages , number one . number two , we 're here for you to count on when you need us . we 're independent , but we 're here if you need us . in general , we 'll cooperate with you and your businesses , and you in turn will cooperate with us . pari persu .
oh my god , sir !
whatever i can do to help .
the sweep is just routine , not even police action . i 'd like to see some sort of ... meaningful evidence ...
can you get me that ring back ?
what do you think you 're doing ? ! get down !
ready ?
the old lady ?
dad stop it !
i 'll take the lead and handle the physical threats . you watch the elapsed time and look for exits .
no time , no time , yes . sit , sit , sit . alex sits next to him .
nice friend .
oh , nice .
how long will that be ?
all right , put up your hands . no fast moves . come on out here , both of you .
of course . are there others , mr. worley ?
oh , you know what . i 'm suffocating !
you see eddie 's face when i gave him the timer ? wish i had a picture of it .
you just want to get away from daddy and you 're using me to do it !
i said no !
fine .
you 're crazy ! you ca n't do that !
amen .
before we begin , i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview . you could have chosen mike wallace , barbara walters , jane pauley , whatnot but you 're here .
being unhappy is a state of mind . i never thought about it .
the basic principles of time travel are there . so you have the vessel and the portal . and the vessel can be anything . most likely a spacecraft .
i ca n't find him .
this guy , zero , he drifts around , that 's how they all start , drifting around , their minds filling up with fantasies . he thinks he 's real smart , laughs at us , laughs at his victims . but he has left a trail , and the trail is somewhere in those names . you know how to reach me . take my advice , when dealing with these fbi tight-asses , go by the book . that 's what i did .
well , how about these two movies ?
a very short while , uncle . i 've been given permission to stay only a few days .
she went to california , to los angeles ... she wanted to start over . she wanted to be an actress ...
who do you think ?
so i hear . you 've also been smoking a lot of marijuana , i understand .
he 's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off .
and another !
all living things pay dues , conor . they must be respected for that .
you wo n't consider another course of action , for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ?
they were wearing ski masks . i told you all of this .
they do n't . now , son . if you get the job , you 're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways . here 's a little piece of advice : do n't use this so much .
ah , craig . just the fellow i wanted to see . juicer ! easy as pie . just keep your fingers clear of the blade , and never , never use it while bathing in a tub full of water .
all right . take him to my place . he can crash on the sofa .
c'mon , you think you 're dealing with a bunch of assholes ? mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs ! now how did he get that ... in a fresh water reservoir ?
yeah , i read your piece . it 's very smart . and very wrong .
she has all the cooking talent .
you think that 's the answer ? sex ? is that what you want ? you want me to make love to you ?
they think i 'm nuts .
well , it 's a nice surprise . should i hit the `` stop '' button ?
well , time will tell , wo n't it ?
why ?
of course ! it defines society ! to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself !
if the other side ever gets hold of a thing like that ...
okay , well , then , i 'm gon na break new ground .
i guess ...
there 's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up .
all the evidence against him disappeared , the smuggling case was unsolved . tan resigned and went over to the triads openly .
he told you that ...
yes . thank you . but i think we both know there 's more to it than that . do you believe in fate , neo ?
oh , no you do n't . harry , now , not my best haviland .
i guess it 's just you and me , huh ?
do we need this ... ?
it just happened . it was just this thing that happened along with everything else . can you understand that ?
it 's sanskrit . it tells the story of sankara climbing mt . kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva .
that 's not sayin ' much .
say hi to rob and carrie . have some fun !
why not ?
only at the very end .
as you say , doctor .
put your head back .
i wonder if she truly left the ira .
no , c'mon , freddy , let 's have this out & over . you know what everyone thinks ? they think you 're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass . and no one 's blaming you for it , i hear she 's worth the flowers . but do n't come in here get- ting holy over us . sure i put it in the paper . coz i wanted to < u > stop < /u > this bullshit . i do n't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain . it 's pissing < u > me < /u > , & < u > everyone < /u > off .
i know , dad . i love you too .
i think we should go . please . before he wakes up and , i do n't know , eats us , or whatever feral things do .
do you like poetry , raymond ?
flynn had access to you , too . i 'm not interested in talking about him .
the ginger i knew would n't even look at this creep .
you 're a movie buff ?
maybe . i should call ben .
the only thing you can do . you must end it .
you promised you would get me to my ship .

hey , it 's the general .
-- the witch kills children --
and what happened to von der nul ?
i like how it feels not to feel .
no . she wanted me to know the truth . now that i do ... i think she 's at peace .
you live in such a fantasy world ...
this is a first . you criticized the deputy director to his face and you still have a badge ? you must have some one-of-a-kind skills . why do n't you just quit ? i mean , you 're not going to get promoted , not wearing this jacket .
you run along -- i want to fix my face .
say cheese ...
that 's the mickey and mallory way .
i 'm talking to myself here .
she ca n't even remember the birth . do you think she 'd admit to the conception ?

sherry , sherry ...

you think this is fucking funny ? ?
he is ... ?
praetor shinzon , i 'm pleased to ...
you know , a hundred and fifty years ago you 'd have been scalped for that remark about native americans . right here where your house is -- you 'd have been scalped .
... yeah , but entertainment law is n't something you just jump into ...
you must be mad .
yeah , and it 's the truth , to the best of my knowledge . and , frankly , i 'm glad . for steve 's sake , i 'm glad , not yours . i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart . steve should n't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age .
you okay ?
sorry ?

brave young heroes . be nice to them , my dear . blow them a kiss .
there is . they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses .
i know her . i knew her .
well , we 'll just have to wait and see , wo n't we ?
please .
she gets off in an hour , so i think i 'm just going to have a drink and then ... make sure she gets home safe .
but see that 's just the point . it ca n't stop at once . because it 's in you . and you ca n't stop something that 's in you .
he did n't say anything to me about it .
why do n't you leave me alone ?

no , i intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause i do n't like you .
mr. sulu , take the con . i 'm taking our guest down to see her whales . mr. spock : have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program ?
are you certain this is the right way ?
roger .
i 'm not scared , mrs. robinson .
do n't horse me . price of zinc 's never been higher . they do n't want no strike -- not with their war boom on .
`` some prophet guy . '' and a city man . but he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of god .
so am i ... sit down . would you get us a couple of drinks ?
this play ?
move ? you 're alive . if you want , i can fly .
you do n't ? well what 's your favorite food then ?

they all know you ?
old woman !
man , it 's already ten thirty .
no .
sure .
halfway where ? you 've got ta come home . we 've been worried sick about you . are you alright ?
the disk job sold you is worthless . it 's bait , part of an internal molehunt .
`` the '' cause of dullness in others --
only on odd days .
hard to judge how these things happen . the parole board almost never reverses their decisions .
it 's not exactly what i 'd call a large turn-out .
as large as castles .
if reed 's right , then this little trip will double our stock offering .
that 's just one of the privileges that goes with this job . you also get a nice little expense account , the use of the executive washroom -- say , what happened to you , baxter ?
yes you can ... .
it 's late . we should go back .
but you 're not . you 're somewhere else . you 're someone else --
i know . we just could n't wait 'till monday to find out .
and there she is --
the damage was considerable . but she 's insured . thanks , again .
it 's anti-nature .
let me show you something . the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released , you keep pressure on it so you do n't --
that 's impossible .
i would n't bring you here on a hoax . houston confirms the telemetry and i.d . codes .
hammond .

i need a new pr guy .
hello , frances .
the voice again .
look , goddamnit , i never asked you for a goddamn thing ! i 've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible . after mom divorced you , did i ask you for anything ? when i would n't see ya for six months to a year at a time , did you ever get your shit about it ? no , it was always `` ok '' , `` no problem '' , `` you 're a busy guy , i understand '' . the whole time you were a drunk , did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit ? no ! everybody else did . i never did . you see , i know that you 're just a bad parent . you 're not really very good at it . but i know you love me . i 'm basically a pretty resourceful guy . if i did n't really need it i would n't ask . and if you say no , do n't worry about it . i 'm gone . no problems .
'it 's up to joe ' ? those were his words ?
am i to take it you want to live ?

the same old , same old . trying to get my stuff through .
did she do that to you , too ?
oh , he 's ... he drifted off . he 'll sleep for a while now . what is it you have to do , exactly ?
honestly , cal , if you were n't forever booking everything at the last instant , we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family .
yessir .
the tunnel .
i 'll talk the way i want to . i 've had enough of this .
nothing . look , i 'll write it down for you , okay ?

what you do n't want to imagine is the things i 've done .
i heard you might be moving back ...
that sucks . heh heh . they need some shows about fire ! change the channel .
no , i do n't care about you -- you 're fantastic . my whole interest , if it 's not too late , is in susie ... and how to undo what you 've done to her ...
oh ?

mr. simpson ...
who 's coming for me ?
lady cosgrove , you are an old fool .
i would n't mind a havin ' supper .
no , no , no , max , that 's a very convenient out . every time some group disagrees with you it 's because of anti-semitism .
what for ? if it 's not here , why bother him ?
now do n't pick a fight . i 'm staying over .
hey ! what about the film ?
please , raoul . i can give you stars , i know i can . just drop the safe on my head one more time .
i 'll take that .
bam bam .

hey , inspector , i do n't intend to take the rap for this .

why did n't you wait for me ?
will you shut-up ! ! !
what ?
yes .
my car 's in the garage .
then again , your dad 's got his own memories and he 's got his own life now ... i think this is a secret just between you and your mom .
oh ... hi , john .
whatever -- all i know is the persecution 's going to start all over again , they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie --
what ?
i 'm a witness . i heard you threaten her life .
i 'll be there in three days -- four at the most . i 've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ai n't after you , and --
no , and yes . i do n't know what i 'm going to do about bobby . i know he is seeing someone else and that 's okay with me , and he thinks i 'm seeing someone else and that 's not okay with him .
carcaradon carcharias . a great white .
daddy 's dead .
tell that to the pigs . better yet tell that to malcolm .
not a dump , then , but kind of plain . uninspired . and there 's a stale smell . sort of stuffy . i do n't know . stuffy .
the former duchess !
you were ? i thought you were chasing me ?
the mayor 's outside .
oh . that . i know what you mean . i had nightmares all week .
yes i do .
jack has n't loved me for years . and now i 'm afraid she 's turning out to be like him . so cold and distant . i 've let him make her like that .
i 'm going ashore to take a look around the island . there are some ruins up there ...
jesus , patrick !
'pardon me for being rude , it was not me , it was my food . it just popped up to say hello , and now it 's gone back down below . '
look , reese , i did n't ask for this honor and i do n't want it . any of it .
not so bad .
it 's the only way , bud . now trust me .
kill em all . admit it , even you 've thought about it .
i wonder if you could help me .
no you do n't . and fuck you for saying you do . and fuck you for `` saying ... ... for saying there 's just no way . because there could be a way , grady .
come , we have a boat waiting .
but even then , we would n't get everything . i mean some missiles would abort , or they 'd miss their targets , or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we do n't know about .
my parents wo n't be back till ten .
um ... did you still want to read my novel ?
you 've been neglecting the farm , uncle .
oh , you mean the thrill !
them people drinkin ' that cider , they do n't know there 's a cigarette in there !
why would they send us to a deserted camp ?
thank you .
begging the admiral 's pardon : general order 15 : 'no flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort . '
just be careful , okay ?
-- a hot water bottle would be good if we had one .
you 'd take a polygraph on it ?
priests . imhotep 's priests .
and you 're mine .
uh ... uh ... what is it ?
it helps . it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp . as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand , i shall turn on the radio .
int . tunnel - day .
first off , he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes . i told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no . as you can see --
out for the evening ?
you must n't give way to despair . you must wait .
`` you ca n't shoot 'em ! '' i like that . i bet she led you on good , did n't she ? taking you up to the house to hang drapes . oh that 's a good one . bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face . i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . then me busting in like some wild bear . ha ! bet you had a fire going under you .
yeah , but , what if this guy lived a billion , trillion years ago ? like , what if he was a cave man , and now he 's dead ?
hello , my dearest darling . so good to hear your voice again .
well , i have n't played in a while because of these kidney pains .
yeah . but he needs me alive .
no . i do n't want to see you .
there 's no number for frank in any of earl 's stuff and he 's pretty out of it -- i mean , like i said , he 's dying , y'know . dying of cancer .
nothing scary there . sorry .
he told me they knew i was coming here .
what kind of trouble ?
i did n't .
when was that ? in the swamp at the expense of your men ? or when he killed thomas at the expense of your family ?
his name 's armitage . he 's very anxious to meet you .
i promised him a new uniform when we re-opened . and you 'll get one , too .
a girl ... ?
i do n't have a boyfriend .
just over a year .
of course it was damone . if it was ron johnson , you 'd be out to here !
i guess it would be pretty awkward .
you look awful .
four , five miles .
why ?
it 's on the college .
you 'll be fine . no matter what leo kubelsky says , you 've got a hundred and seventy-five years of american law on your side . do n't forget that .
we ended in f major ?
it leads farther than that .
no . it 's one of the few times i feel good . i used to have to go to work and cook every day . that i got sick of .
he 's still alive , edna !
george !
di caprio .
i 'm married , ishmael . it is n't right for us to be alone . people will t ...
i 'm listening , sir .
you 're only right .
it 's called a spinal block , and you ca n't have it yet , honey . the doctor said you 're not dilated enough .
oh , for -- h. sebastian -- butch ! listen , it 's a matter of life and death ! listen !
i do n't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing .
duly noted . now i 'm gon na ask you for one last favor .
nobody 's helping me . tommy got four years . marty and fran are broke . i asked your friend remo for the money he owed you , and you know what he told me ?
no .
how the fuck did you know ?
then who is ? come on , nell . deep down , if you really thought it was n't jim , why would n't you be leaving right this second ? why would n't you be afraid ? really afraid .
what 's she doing in california ?
and ?
do you want more rice ?
nah , skip that ... i 'm going to have to keep an eye on you , though .
dammit !
shut it , teddy .
tommy , you are the falcon , winged lord of the sky .
it you harm michael , i will let my anger loose . and you will feel that . do you understand ... ?
these old movies are such a hoot . they thought they were being scary , but they 're just funny .
you mean now or before ?
that 's the idea , general schmuck . zlat !
i was just passin ' the time .
yes -- that --
he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
when ?
nothing at all ?
none of your damn business .
how do i know you 're telling the truth ?
you 're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with . i 'll send morgan or lambert .
okay , i 'm stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?
i think we all want to feel we 've left our mark on the world . yes . i wish i had done more work .
is that what you did ?
you need time to think . about the case , about you and me .
ok. i 'll be at your studio thursday three o'clock .
he 's dead .
-- fuck off !
congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel .
anti-semite !
thanks , honey .
i know that .
i do n't wan na talk to a teacher , it 's summer !
in the window . norman 's at work .
i never joke about money .

ayuh . it was the rag-man told me about the place -- stanley bouchard . us kids just called him stanny b. he was half micmac himself .
whose word ?
naw .
yep .

so i was driving to work today , and some bozo in a cadillac cut me off ...
or teach it a better tune .
i 'm gon na stomp your a --
how nice . how do you do , senator ?
uh , look ... why do n't you just take the car ...
uh , that 's okay .
just like in the war . harass their supply lines . we kill the railroad 's men , they wo n't care .
i got ta talk to you .
what !
right . well ... listen , i 'm i 'm sorry about that whole ... thing.. before . it was kind of a misunderstanding . i 'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people ... how 's the uh ... ... that going to heal up ? god , i hope so , i feel just awful about that .
did you think it was going to be easy ? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet ?
you know what it is , harry .
i 'm sorry about that . it was n't mine in the first place .
i wish it were .
almost like someone put him up to it . okay , who ?
and if i could describe it , it probably would n't be on a radio show . but what the hell . it 's not one specific thing . it 's more of a feeling .
i 'm afraid .
not with this ...
... he 's a good man ...
this is a daily paper , we 'll explain it tomorrow . you 're certain on mitchell ?
great grief ! what 's that other paper going to give you ?
no , jane .
it 's not that late in seattle .
i 'm your man ... you win again . well played , sir . you are on fire .
ca n't you talk to him ? maybe talk him into it . i 'm a real good interviewer . just get me in the room with him .
no . do you ?
what about the captain ? where 's he from ?
you said trask was arranging laboratory work . police laboratory . anything from that ?
oh , la .
oh , yeah , right . i forgot .
yeah , but i ai n't talking horse . i 'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that 's a quick ticket to heaven . and the fools keep coming back for more .
has she talked with you since prison ?
there you have me .
talk about dumb luck . odds of anybody finding that girl , thirty years later . and then the chances of hitting a dental ... forget about it . bets part is she 's the first victim . she knew the doer . i 'm betting those bones are gon na do a lot of talking .
you ca n't expect him to learn everything the first day . hopefully it 's taught him a very valuable lesson .
and do n't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come !
dylan . and ... chase . my god , wes , did you know ?
okay . i just thought as long as it was paid for --
no , why ?
gee . i 'm sorry to hear that .
yeah . i sure know that . yeah , but how many more are out there ?
yes . they said it was n't the driver 's fault . harry often said what a careful driver he was .
ordell has a white guy working for him named louis .
what give you that idea . i seen one of the cats heard it .
too hot in the lighthouse ?
poppy , order the trucks from the gary plant . and we 're going to need a containment crew .
no one of consequence .
did you expect him to look you up ?
what did you find out ?
lock phasers and return fire !
he must mean after `` slime creature 3 '' .
was someone rude to you ?
no , there 's only one report to complete . i 'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the castle today or tomorrow .
no ! i have a boyfriend . he loves me .
i do n't understand it , lieutenant . it 's not getting anything from 4th brigade ... not even their transponder .
practically no one .
95 continued :
oh , yeah , yeah . how old is she now ?
i hate it too . i hate this trip .
not classic , no .
it 's amazing that your sweet , lovely , gorgeous wife can ever get to see you .
they got to stop < u > sometime < /u > ... if they 're human at all , they got to stop !
sorry , mr. gekko .
i guess that 's why you go for hot lips houlihan .
what happened ... . where are you taking him ?
destiny .
maybe he 's dead too . maybe you killed them both , mueller --
get out ! all of you !
nobody knows she 's here . i called her personally . nobody knows .
hell , no . i ai n't goin ' down in the ditch .
we 're just having a little drink .
m 'm .
we have all of this without you . you can not bargain with what you do n't have .
least we 'd already be at the morgue .
i 'm sorry to hear that . a famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted .
is there another key ?
-- well , i 've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around , would n't you say so ? --
who is this madame sconce ? let 's find her and talk to her .
not if i do n't let her .
i said it did n't sound like you .
what does that mean , frank ? i do n't get it . why ?
i ca n't see a thing .
... people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you 're doing ... and that you are who you say you are ?
no . the owners are in australia .
get out !
no . why ?
are you okay ?
i do n't believe it ...
you a scorpion ? that 's it . you 're a scorpion . i can tell .
why would you do that ?
well how did it happen ?
frederick , why are you so interested in this particular case ?
steve . board of education steve who likes you ? he goes for us hot-blooded mexican girls , i can tell .
that 's no good . it 'll be dark soon , there 's no other shelter for ten miles . if they show , they 'll take you too . why 'd you have to come up here ? !
not quiet yet . we know who the gun belonged to . margo west . she told us this morning . it does n't mean much . mitchell took it away from her . he had a habit of going through her bag .
where 's egghead ?
my salary . two-fifty .
we ca n't wait . no matter what sollozzo say about a deal , he 's figuring out how to kill pop . you have to get sollozzo now .
you seem fine now .
commentary .
gray -- i 'm rid of him --
oh yes i did . i want you to meet somebody . i expect you 'll like her .
you got the keys to the shop ?
i 'm not sick , richard . i 'm just not tired , now go back to sleep before you 're up for the whole night too !
next stop ...
some day i 'm afraid we 're going to have to tell her about irena .
that 's one of the plagues , right ? the grasshopper plague !
what is it ?
we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !
why ? are we going dancing ?
so let 's go . this place creeps me out .
i think it 's the universal greeting when you do n't like someone .
sure , tracy .
i 'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage .
helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families .
you were n't at harrison 's department store the night before --

yeah , i do . i mean , it 's - it 's the - it 's the best thing you can do right now . i mean this . and you 'll have real security . sweetheart ... you 're gon na be situated just right in vegas .
look , you 've never liked me ...
i wish i could believe that .
we 're no leaving you !
hey , there 's wilkins !
is that a request or a command ?
it 's freezing , is n't it ?
the combination is three-ten-forty-four .
< i > what happened to them ? < /i >
what is < u > this < /u > ?
you left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do ?
i figure it 's karma . you wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children , so this is karma biting you on the ass , or in your case ... ... on the eye .
never mind that , i want my man !
i do n't believe it ! i do n't believe a word of it !
there 's nothing harder .
anything wrong ?
`` with that , fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched , that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue -- ''
good . you conquer the demon , but your horse is sinking in the bog . what do you do ?
my boyfriend will be here any second and he 'll be pissed when i tell him ...
you think this 'll work ?
this is for you to figure out . you can have it your way or you can have it his way . but you ca n't have it both ways . am i right , sonny ?
it better be . last time you had me introduce a dead guy .
like a woman of mystery .
yes you do . if you love me you can wait , right ? a month , six months , whatever it takes .
which one 's which ?
he 'll find his way back .
what the hell you looking at me like that for ?
positive .
that 's true .
what are you talking about ? who 's janet ?
you do n't have a driver 's license , james ? or a social security card ?
touring the riot scene . gravely assessing the devastation . upstanding mayor stuff .
what have you got in mind , general .
why not ?
when you were hauling chickens for kaiser poultry , what was the furthest you ever went off the island ?
it 's your girlfriend , big guy , open up .
we 've got to get out of this shower .
let 's ... no one 's going to know , let 's go around the corner and we 'll get a drink .
she seemed fine .
we ca n't lead him into the other hull !
oh my god , he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit .
i know that .
fine . the first thing to do is -- present mr. smith to the press -- in the *right* way . hurry him along , bill .
eighth room down , babe ...
it 's going to be okay .
in a dinosaur kinda way , yeah .
thank you , josie mae .
yes , but sometimes i 'm still not sure which side of the wall i 'm on .
yeah , and , as you can see , home invasions are big , too .
get a job and probably go back to school . figure out what i 'm gon na be .
well ... ?
you think i scam ?
no need to apologize .
how bout you ? i 'll give you the whole hundred !
i got to go .
there 's a goddamn sign on the gate .

you go to hell .

you live here , in berlin ?
where 's lenny ?
now , squire , you 're not going to let me down . we still want to do a lot of business together , do n't we ?
then wh-where do we land ?
so ? girls left bars with ted bundy too . it does n't rule out foul play .
never been this close .
if you wish to put things on that basis , then i will say good day to you , monsieur .
the chinese have a proverb : `` that which appears too good to be true , usually is . '' there 's got ta be a catch .
it 's locked .
why not ?
hey kid , it 's me , bill munny .
how 's he supposed to see the wire ?
we抳e been pawns in someone抯 game . they tricked us into bringing the money to king . not just elaborate . cock-sure .
c'mon man , who 're you gon na believe ? those guys are -- we dropped off the damn money --
no , we 're just ...
i think you 're getting a little moody there , eddie .
big bad eddie mack ? got shit for brains and that 's a fack . hey-heh ...
no .

the case that i am < u > working < /u > on ...
i have not been on the island in twenty years . it is changed - changed completely . where are the graves -- the coffins ?

they 're re-routing the deflector power conduits ...
i 'm at the earle .
excuse me , sister ?
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth ?
29 years ... ?

-- coming out of the water --
months ?
yeah , captain , as soon as i make a call .
i have a seat . i 've had it since nine .

well ... we must keep her close , then . here , she 'll be safe if we put her between --
just a boid in a gilded cage -
maybe you thought you 'd be back this way someday .
diamond . yes it is . 56 carats .
good . what do you want ?
there 's no vodka in it .
you send me a wire as soon as you arrive .
but you 've got a big choice right now . you can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life . or you can choose to see it for what it really is : an opportunity . i personally think you have a big future ahead of you , and i do n't mean the fleeting glory of sports .
i wish i could say . but if i could answer that , i could also tell you why people are trying to kill people .
what do you mean ?
theo 's dead .
here梩ake mine .
where are you goin ' ? where are you ? you 're in that place . where are you ?
well , i mean , roeder 's gone , now ... a dead end . believe me , i 'm sorry too , but ...
nah , it 's not so great . here 's the one i 'd recommend .
how 's it going chef ?
bit , scratched . but i had her pinned . she calmed down . i was going to cuff her ... she said she thought she was going to be sick . she asked to use the bathroom .
and here 's to him . everything in moderation , frankenstein .
i 'm sure i will .
you 're lucky . how many vets you know are even employed ?
you been on the farm for quite a spell , have n't you ?
totally . all i 've had for chow was a packet of pop rocks and a yoo-hoo .
here -- take him home .
to bed .
yeah , right outside the door !
you 've got to be kidding .
i hope she 's all right . how much more do i have to do of this ?
i did not get the report from an mi-6 agent .
where are you , pete ?
you 're asking for somebody else ?
well , mr. smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?
can you try ?
yep . afraid you have me at a disadvantage .
and how should we do that , sir ?
huh . i did not know that . well , it 's water under the bridge . and we do enter the next round-robin , am i wrong ?
hey , she does n't want to go with you . come on .
let her know what ?
i 'm sorry -- i made a mistake .
and everything . he should be king !

i could n't stop myself .
- and you got to be girls .
not me ... no way ...
make a lovely item for `` good morning , america ''
dog , i have found the cash !
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but , i mean , that was like - i mean , i have some dignity .
that was bundy . he killed forty of them , identical , long hair , parted in the middle , alike as barbie dolls . ... this is hopeless . let 's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and tv hookups and broadcast a warning ?
yes .
jesus ... they can tell that ...

i do n't know . maybe eighteen grams .
how do you know it 's for us ?
hush . no , it is never terrible to be in love . nathan 's memory lives on in our sacred union . i 'm not sorry she killed him either . nathan was wonderful . he was erudite and sophisticated and charming . you are all that , too . but you have something more . you have a bit of the animal in you .
let him find out on his own . i want the hong kong police handling this .
she left me .
very early . dawn .
oh yeah , i can tell you really love it !
there 's no more time for games . they made you . there 's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it 's true .

i 'm going to see what it is .
i have to talk to you .
some things never change , do they ?
it 's been six months .
oh , i 've got plenty .
when i was a boy , my father would take me there , to hunt . there are a few savages , but no man can live there , no white man .
if you ca n't feel the other guy 's pecker , you ai n't in tight enough ! i want nuts to butts !
i ca n't kill my own father .
we do n't need no fences at camp 8 , boss .

i should n't wonder . not a woman inside boodles since --
we hire a lot of moonlighters here .
grissom to landing party . we have you approaching radioactive indications . do you concur ?
who 's that ?
what do you expect from an ad lib ... raymond chandler ?
they 're stupendously successful . you ca n't get a seat . the only problem is none will hire me . they all want to hear me play , but they wo n't let me teach their daughters . as if i was some kind of fiend . i 'm not a fiend !
sure , i 'm taking the captain 's exam next year . after the kids are in school , louise can go back to the post office and , i thought , what the hell , i 'll start my own medic service . out on the island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal . it 's just a matter of time and who you know . someday it 's going to be chief larry calling the shots .
do n't you want to go ?
yes ?
... and please call me robert .
actually -- i 'm not real ... hungry .
frankly , sir , it stinks . i have no access . i 'm lucky helms lets me have a staff .

i was going to show this to the principal , but i wanted to talk to you first .
i miss my brother .
what 's that ?
i have to go .
oh , forget it . clark brandon 's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening . take me ?

in other words , seven times out of a hundred , you 're wrong !
yes , sir .
no , man , i 'm doing okay . thanks .

well , we 'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance , but without knowing what he 's going to do ...
why they glow like that ?
with some milk jugs i just happened to pick up on the way home .
no .
hurry up on that trap . what are you trying to do , sefton ? gum up the works ?
a card ?
you married that fool , clive , that 's what . never mind , you can stay with us .

we are launching everything we have .
perfectly absurd .
oh , great . i 'll talk to you later , bye .
california .
yes , mom ?
lon ? he got married . he has a kid . i kind of lost touch with him after nancy got sick .
< i > well ... i think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us . i 'm also a bail bondsman out of los angeles . i can track down and deliver these crooks to you ... for a small finder 's fee of course. < /i >
i do n't need that kind of love . and i do n't want to be reminded all the time that big mama 's grandmother was born in slavery . if you really care about me , just tell me how i can make money .
how soon ?
the forward airlock .
what was i supposed to do ? when you did n't show up saturday , i tried to call . your phone is n't working .
are we all museum bigots in maine ?
now look , daphne - hands off - i saw him first .
i feel like the world 's biggest idiot .
if it was n't for a drunk i would have picked you up . he wanted to go to the dmz .
two way ?
i know i hate swiss cheese , the holes make me nervous .
i do n't know . probably not .
no , no , just listen . you won the wreath fellowship .
i know how you feel , miss kubelik . you think it 's the end of the world -- but it 's not , really . i went through exactly the same thing myself .
go back to sleep .
- and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were .
hey frank . you should n't be coming over here . my parents really do n't want you to .
yeah .
leave your phone on the hook .
thanks , but i 'm fine .
but you do n't know where he is .
do you have any czech girls working for you ?
just do n't go in there half cocked . you guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later .
just until the deutsche mark turns ...
hey .
sit down and join us , cindy .
today is the best day of the rest of our lives .
i do n't ... ... i just thought it was weird .
like what ?
been telling you that all along , lad .
sorry . it 's a pretty name , though . it means `` merciful '' , right ?
what 's in there ?
i did n't think you smoked bud that much .
i do n't think the dead much care .
uh , i do n't know .
what ?
i came to you straight after he did it . i showed you what he 'd done and asked for your help .
no ... no ... the worst was when i went in for this after-school special and i 'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids . i see they 're all signed in for the same role as me ...
'i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system . i am an explorer in space , with no hostile intentions against your civilization . on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal , while the apes remained ... ''
i-i-i-i-i d-d-do n't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does .
please , mr. webster , you 're a great humanitarian . ai n't you heard what it 's like in them jails ? you send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and ...
yeah , i know where that is , it 's right by my house . it 's dr. satan 's tree . i can show ya .
a higher calling like getting girls and making money ?
first door up the stairs .
american weapons ?
monica . what are you doing here ?
various enterprises , style of thing .
i 'll tell you something , annie -- i stood there looking at what was happening to that horse ... and , i swear , it felt like the same thing was happening to me .
you okay ?
that we are .
water . worth killing for out here , i 'd think .
hold up . first , we have to decide who gets who , remember ? no more competition ?
uh-huh .
hi sport .
yes mr. lebowski , these unfortunate souls can not love in the true sense of the word . our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these .

i nuttin ' to do wi ' dat .
mr. gower ! mr. gower ! this is george bailey ! do n't you know me ?
he swore by it . what ?
you need a ride , preacher ?
do n't you even want to ask ?
after all that i 've done for that fuck ! and he wants to be with that slut ? fine ! he can have his slut !
i do n't know ! i 'm sorry !
you must not come here ! how many times do i have to tell you ? if the film catches fire , runt that you are , you 'd go up in a burst of flame ... whoosh ! and turn into a piece of ...
yeah .
yeah .
where 's jamie ?
good . songs . what songs should sidney -- pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play ?
ooh !
oh , right . you 're gon na be a tv star .
you get off havin ' control over me . let me choose how to deal with it .
stan , you 're depressing me ... hey , i did n't know you were going to fill 'er up . just take a couple of gallons , okay ?
you a student ?
least i 'm not down there herding sheep !
that 's too bad . that 's casablanca 's leading commodity . in refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market .
it 's my mother . who needs this shit ?
you must shut off the power , this is very important do you understa-
so tell me , do you like ron ? is it serious ?
why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters .
he using her .
it 's been a long time coming . i finally made up my mind -- i guess it was thursday .
listen , bren-duhhh , i think you 're the one overstepping boundaries . you 're acting like you 're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else . besides , who cares if he 's married ? i can have friends who are married .
i think he kind of liked me ... is that so hard to imagine ?
you do n't know that . it could be a trick .
ah-ha . so what is that -- a radio ?
what people ?
truthfully ? i would n't know how .
yes , sir .
not all men hit . and no one is going to hit you anymore .
stand by , powell . i got ta check something out .
the thing is , senator , and i do n't want to get in the middle of nothing , but --
then move not , while my prayer 's effect i take . thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
the floor has a nice shine to it . oh god -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine .
i tell you , we 're going west , and shanghai is east of here !
fine , louis . we 'll stop in for a drink .
we have a library ?
sure . i 've got a gas powered jeep . i can drop her at the visitor 's center before i make the boat with the others .
oh not to bad , kinda like the walt disney version of the ho chi minh story , but other than that it was terrific .
is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
we 're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems . unfortunately .
see what i mean about it getting spooky ?
i 've been surprised in an unguarded hour , but must not now go back ; the love that lay , half smothered in my breast , has broke through all , its weak restraints , and burns in its full lustre . i can not , if i would , conceal it from thee .
come now , mr. chance .
basic . hmmm .
what about citrine ?
well , there it is ; the last resort . sure you wan na go in ?
bill , you know how much i do - but over the phone , now really , that 's kid stuff ...
no ...
really ? how much ?
but even if you get your revenge , you wo n't remember it . you wo n't even know it 's happened .
sure . i wish you all the luck in the world , pal .
did i have anything to say about it ?
i 'd quit the army for you , if it came to that .
it means it 's too cold to go swimming . and i do n't mean the water .
you attacked me .
no .
from now on you 'll be history
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .
did you see all this stuff in the papers ?
that 's very kind of you , but i 'll bet it 's not altogether true .
he 's feeling wonderful .
oh christ . julia ...
it 's true ! i was here last year doing a piece , remember ? i was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored mps . they were all incredibly fat and beery , huge trousers and braces . and so sweet . they all stood round me like children saying 'you ! working for television ? you 're just a young thing . ' they would n't let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying . they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'oo , can i ? '
technically , they are still under the clemenza wing of the corleone family , now run by frankie pentangeli . after clemenza died , the rosatos wanted territory of their own . pentangeli refused , and came to me , asking for permission to eliminate them . i , of course , knew of their relationship with you , and in gratitude for your help with the tropicana matter , turned him down . pentangeli was furious , and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed . i was lucky and he was stupid . i 'll visit him soon . the important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans , yours and mine . this thing of ours , that we will build .
no , thank you , mr. sheldrake . as a matter of fact , i 've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
-- oh i thought you were --
does she blame it on me ? the baby ?
every time i tell you that i love you , you flinch . but that 's your problem .
just one favor .
it 'll end . it 'll end with him and mccay . then the park shuts down . permanently .
i prefer the floor .
jesus , what a rude person ...
trust me .
is that what you think --
from pursuing your chosen profession .
let ' s do it .
maybe . maybe . the call of the wild !
thought you were going to washington , skipper .
yeah ! we 're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks ! we 're gon na score !
the lady you called , how do you know she can help us ?
i swear i 'm innocent . i swear on the head of my children , i 'm innocent . mike , do n't do this to me , please mike , do n't do this to me !
no , no . i-i-i understand completely . no problem . y-you 're busy . i-i-i ...
i wo n't be more than ten minutes , i promise you .
no you did n't . you took the car .
no .
your mother came in about three in the afternoon . her neighbor drove her , on account of your father was on business in wichita . you were born a week early , but there were no complications . it was a perfect delivery . now , your father was sorry to miss it , but it was n't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then , so i ca n't see as it would have been much different had he been there . and that 's the real story of how you were born .
i guess i got a little overexcited . was n't it incredible ! i 'm telling you , this is a first . you know what this could mean to the university ?
no , you ca n't . look , as soon as i tell you , run through this door here and into the big car that 's waiting .
it 's what you and rosanna named me . right ?
but sir , i think it 's imperative . i think the messages , the animals we 've seen , what killed edmunds , the reading you got earlier -- i think they 're all related .
hang on , lauren . we 're conferencing in sophy .
it 's mr. oh . i 'm not answering it .
well ... you ca n't have them all .
i do n't suppose you 've seen her .
`` make '' him ?
you want the title shot or not ?
just come by to wish you luck . need anything ?
danny , you know how many times i saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose , and could n't do a thing about it -- for you , or for your mother ... or your father , with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas , and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit ? you 've made your sacrifice , danny . it 's time i made mine .
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield , with your sword in your hand , waving it above your head ... charging against the enemy , screaming and yelling ... fighting for your life ... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone ?
i believe you -- so what happens now ?
you wo n't hear that from hooks . because the charge is < u > first < /u > -degree murder , which requires premeditation . he ca n't change the charge .
great .
do we always follow mother 's instructions ?
nothing . i think i twisted my --
be careful .
look over there .
she could n't have . we ca n't < u > make < /u > them see us .
'scuse me , just finished dinner . um . frankly , doris 'd be better off with the county defender .
yeah you do . it 's up to you either here or downtown .
... once or twice . his name is charlie meadows .
five bucks ! you mean you 're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it ?
considering where i 've been ...
oh . so ... what brings you down here ?
i just stopped in to say hi .
cursin ' . that 's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct , mate .
mr. shaw , this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy , that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal political-espionage activities . it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities .
i know a little bit about human nature and what i 've seen only confirms that .
indeed it is .
amen . they cross themselves .
how should i know ?
look who 's back ? want some champagne ?
we sell it . i got it all figured out . we make three finger lids and sell them on the beach . we move all of it . we 've made ourselves a hundred bucks . or a lot of weed for our head . what do you think ? not bad , huh ? i got the baggies and everything .
we ca n't all be perfect , saavik . you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land . around you are humans , and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence . you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you . tolerance is logical .
what happened ?
please . dario argento is the ultimate master of horror .
100 years !
right now we have to be practical .
bernstein .
you ca n't do that ... listen to the mood of the crowd .
why , honey , it makes folks happy to see a girl that way -- makes folks sort of giggly an ' happy .
that is correct , comrade skrapinov . we have ascertained that gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the american government .
well , no - it 's more like a `` found art object . ''
no , see , neil , if you 're fucking with one of my friends , then you 're fucking with me .
no , that 's not a date , a date is when i do n't cook .
speak when you 're spoken to . he likes his women quiet .
without a song in my heart .
not with your own cloth . besides , your pockets will be stitched .
i got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time . i 'll fire you tomorrow . i promise .
i do n't know what you want , but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss . money , jewels , a very big ball of string ...
and ... what does jeanne think ?
sorry . uh , let me see , have a seat . i 'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too .
i want to see pilgrim .
viktor ! stay the course .
you 're way ahead of me again ?
leonard . what my daughter is on about , mr lombard , is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian . you might as well know that ...
just what i want to do .
gone with daniel webster -- to marshfield , son ... . you told mary to go --
that 's right , sir , i recall it . a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town , where all the lights were .
i 'm so humiliated . i do n't know what to say . i mean --
we 'll get safely out of here , do n't worry .
something happened to anna in burkittsville , in the woods , i do n't know .
what 's he fixin ' to do , ma ?
i do n't blame you .
the power ... i need ... more power ... to control ... the storm --
i went to see her -- some fuckin ' asshole answers the door in his underwear , he 's fifty years old , there 's coke and shit laid out on the table --
i fell asleep .
strange .
in all due respect , he sounds kind of pathetic to me . the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend . have you two ace detectives checked that out ?
i think you know i 'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap .
well , fi ' cents a box ai n't much , but a fella can eat .
about anything .
survival of the fittest .
it 's a good idea for a newspaper . four hundred sixy thousand .
what do you mean ?
any time . but you do n't have to worry about a thing for a while . marty went down to corpus yesterday .
yes sir !
this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving .
well -- that 's very fine . saunders , some person in your office says you 've quit --
i do n't know what 's keeping me . i should 've been here a long time ago . now how about my proposition ?
is that what you think ?
they ran his name and got a hit . he 's been in before .
yes , sir .
bye .
mr. jefferson carver ?
to make sure she 's all right .
i think so too .
how not all of them own apartment complexes , how not all of them play the stock market , how not all of them rent babies when they 're panhandling . he 's ten years old , bernie ! impressionable !
it 's too clean .
what an act of benevolence -- a service to the community . so that 's it . now there 's nothing between you and ignition .
why do you think she is a witch ?
it is awfully hot down here . how do you manage to stay so cool ?
well , i do n't think you can get more common than me , al .
where 's he from ?
yes . you ?
right , right , sorry .
no .
how 'd you learn so much about dreams ?
what ? no no . he 's got a parrot on his shoulder , buries treasure ...
what 's the surprise ?
what is it you want ?
then tell him to wax it too .
too big . more like a freighter .
the borg ship has modified its shields , captain . our phasers will no longer be effective .
i wonder .
i 'm looking for a missing person . my name 's arbogast , private investigator ... trying to trace a young girl who 's been missing almost a week . from phoenix . it 's a private matter ... family wants to forgive her ... she is n't in trouble .
about what ?
i could never move - i 've got too much stuff .
i read the file . yeah . marx and towler . i know who they were .
no prob : i 'll just hop down the hardware store --
i am cinderella the second .
not really .
it would 've just been you , if you would 've kept your mouth shut .
what 's the matter ?
gee , eddie , you 're not gon na go , are ya ? maroon 'll be layin ' for ya at nine o'clock .
skipper ! look at the depth gauge !
oh , listen to me . i 've never even been there and look what i say about it . anyway , i know there 'd be nothing for me to do . i do n't even know anybody there .
no . before anyone moves , you two shake hands and do n't carry it any further .
you know -- some folks are just lucky . others pick gold right out of the air . like that !
we 're interested in the same thing . i 'm writing a story .
maybe i have a little more respect for this country 's institutions than you do , susie . you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob , the cia , fbi , and army intelligence and who knows what else , when you know you ca n't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people ! we got leaks everywhere ! we 're going to trial here ! what the hell do we really got ? oswald , ruby , banister , ferrie are dead . shaw - maybe he 's an agent , i do n't know , but as a covert operator in my book he 's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality .
is that what you 're trying to tell me ?
i thought i 'd listen to some of the tapes . see what 's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe .
one of those business meetings , honey - always coming up in the middle of the night .
the papers are going to eat you alive . even if you beat it , you 'll never get another commission . they want someone to be accountable .
what are you going to do ?
wait , rewind . do you really think she hooked-up with our rob ? they 're so -- different .
hey , jonesy , who 's the best power forward in the nba ... jameson ?
at six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic .
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts ?
you afraid of the dark ?
i do n't know . just should , though . somebody should kill 'em . nobody 'd miss 'em .
what does the writing say ?
how do you know their not ?
i ca n't believe will killed him .
thank you marcel , for that ... extremely redundant explanation .
yeah ? us golden warriors . you 're a good kid , jimmy , a good tough kid . we stick together , huh , kid ?
hello , benjamin .
i could use a vacation . of course , i keep forgetting , for you this < u > is < /u > a vacation .
you did n't see the look she threw me . she 's up to something .
anonymous . probably nothing .
do n't just become excited .
of course i can , but ca n't it wait ? these things cost money , and this town does n't have much money .
you do n't know the half of it . i 'm walter wilder , by the way .
uhura ?
not me , sir . mr. merrick . he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness .
why do you watch ?
and did you write the numeral `one ' down on the record , standing for one hour ?
whatever .
the sooner we do this the better , mr. baker .
then do like i said . men - this boy here 's got something to tell you-all . well , how about it ?
i do n't want you to get involved , really , i mean , i do , but if something went wrong i mean , like you said , they may be involved in murder .
he does n't . i do n't know what he has , but i 'm hoping to god it 's not infectious ...
argentina ! lula , you 're outta your mind . now you just tell me where you are and i 'll come for you . i wo n't say nothin ' to the police about sailor , i promise . he can do what he wants , i do n't care .
f-f-fuck you .
well , if you will excuse me . madame . what a pleasure .
professor , you ever fly one of these things before ?
like i said , all this for some twisted , distorted sense of principal . dunwitty , he just tolerates your negroidal ass , he does n't respect it .
by the way , you 're getting a hell of a car there , mister .
okay , okay ...
i 'm somewhere in the , i 'm on location , eh : this ... well i 'm going to solve it here , or this < u > bimbo < /u > you sent me 's going to be doing a fuckin ' < u > donkey < /u > act in akron , i 'm talking about restraint of trade , breach of ... it 's very simple ... !
man , how 'm i gon na know the ones worth looking at ?
it was good .
fuckers !
what ?
what 're you doin ' ?
your husband ?
one of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city .
earl asked me , linda , please , linda , i 'm sorry -- earl asked me --
why ?
he threw me in a cell , took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if i did n't promise to give up the story .
you 're gon na tell her when you 're resting up in bed with her , jimmy .
i dunno , but next week is my last class ...
do n't worry about it -- i never told you what i thought of that memo either --
mothafuckah !
what ? ! ?
actually . i 've been in twice .
if he 's not dead , he 'll keep coming back .
she 's got a ...
i needed a break .
this is just a game , papa .
matter of fact ...
yes , sir . do n't worry . we handle this kind of thing all the time .
'mean the whispers ?
so , hi there . i 'm ... sister mary clarence . and you 're ... young christians . i guess i should assign you this passage . what 's good ? what were you talking about ?
giancarlo ... rinaldi .

of course . 13 is m ... .mre .

i do n't know . i do n't think there 's any one person . see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody , all the property on the mexican side , sometimes all the property on both sides . warehouses , transportation , even tunnels . it 's very organized .
hi , mickey ...
well , it does n't matter anyhow -- because we 're moving .
the elderly have so much to offer , sir . they are our link with history .
there 's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick . you ever hear that one ?
next time , remind me to do this out in the yard .
wisely and slow ; they stumble that run fast .
what happened ... ?

what did you think of the suspect zero theory ?
tower , say again ! !
no . there 's no way . i mean , do n't you think there 's no way ?
no . the old man died and louise left .
what ?
would it stop you if i did ?
the alarm clock .
whose neck shall i stand on , to make me feel superior ? and what will i get out of it ? i do n't want anything lower than i am . i 'm low enough already . i want to rise . and push everything up with me as i go ...

i did the prep questions for this lab last night . you can copy my answers if you need to .
but that 's what happened .
you do n't look so bad in this light .
neither can i. not any of it . there 's no reference point for what 's going on ; it 's never happened before . it 's a clean break in the fabric of the universe ; a gap . there is nothing to do but experience it , moment-to- moment , and not let it destroy us .
hello -- sorry i 'm late .
lloyd , did you ask your parents ?
hide ? ca n't a fellow have a drink ?
i do n't see why you ca n't just lock me in . it 's not like i can go anywhere .

i know , but we 're on a college campus ...
you 've heard of albert einstein ?
well , i think i_ve got a handle on the czech pysche and i reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties . plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for kafka .
all right -- following me .

little morgan 's got a lot a scrap , dude . i 'd rather fight a big kid , they never fight , everyone 's scared of 'em . you know how many people try to whip morgan 's ass every week ? fuckin ' kid wo n't back down .

oh yeah ? anything you say .
i do n't know . how do i know ?

nathan !
your melancholy eyes ...
i do n't know ...
it was the feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , customs comes down on n.y.p.d . for some answers - they come up with us . they 're grabbing at straws . it 's politics - nothing you can do .
no , but my guess is they 're headed west , so prob'ly texas . their money must be runnin ' low . i do n't think sailor had much to begin with , if any , and lula took the six hundred she had saved in the cherokee thrift .
yes , he does .
what about your family , donnie ?
what 's wrong with you ?

what on earth are they doing ?
i do n't know .
i do n't think you 're a bum .

i know you 're not yet -- but you will be , soon .
i knew she was japanese going into it , but she did n't tell me the ninja assassin part --
hi .
i think you should go with red . it 's the color of confidence .
his dream ? you ca n't control your dreams . and you ca n't control your fears , can you ?
you betray the boy who drew the sword , the boy who saw the dragon ... the dragon who moves close by , coiling and uncoiling , restless , looking down , waiting for the king to be a king ...
let go -- he ca n't -- !
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together .

dude , she 's eight years old , just get her some ice cream or something .
sorry katka , but i 'm with doug on this .
find out when marty rossen 's arriving , get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad .
and then ...
... so mom . truly no grudges -- truly . a little odd that you did n't come to see me when you heard i was hurt , but the important thing i want you to know is your son is happy . i 'm working again . i 'll make do -- i do n't want a thing . would n't take it if it was offered . i 'll drop you a note from wherever i land and then it 's up to you . i hope we patch things up but know that if we do n't , i wish you both the very best ... i ca n't hear you . you heard me , though , right ? good -- take good care .

he never even kids about it .
what is it , your charm ?
they would n't take it .
did you ever ... do you have feelings for anna ?
what is it ?
well , with tortious interference , i 'm afraid ... the greater the truth , the greater the damage .
yes , mr. poe ? so ?
no reason . because you 're leaving , i guess . i do n't think you were there , were you ?
come on . crawl faster .
i remember you were in trouble all the time .

there 's albert ! hey , albert ! ! !
johnny cammareri .
why are there still such headlines ?
i knew it .
oh , you and joe go back a long time . i known joe since i was a kid . but me saying joe definitely could n't have done it is ridiculous . i can say i definitely did n't do it , cause i know what i did or did n't do . but i ca n't definitely say that about anybody else , 'cause i do n't definitely know . for all i know , you 're the rat .
so , two days ?
this janiro 's a good fighter , pretty good-lookin ' kid .
you come in here at least three times a day . you a retard ? a buck fifty .
mookie , what took you so long ? i got a business to run .
all yours . my boss says it 's one of the strangest requests the bureau 's ever had .
hi .
`` gadget guy ? '' while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses , i am , sir , in my own humble way , a man of science .
i think you know . your eyes say you do .
everyone dies but us . we get to carry on and plan the sequel . let 's face it , these days -- you got ta have a sequel .
that 's it .
it 's more than that .

i 've done all i could with the laser .
no , thanks .
what it be is , you are n't coming with us .
good lad .

i guess you 're right ... that is , if the faggot in the next stall thinks it 's okay !
what d'you mean , i just opened it for you ? this is < u > french < /u > champagne .
why , he 'll be back .
wow !
ahh , you know . strikes and gutters , ups and downs .
fuck . i think i 'm gon na throw up , i think . i have n't thrown up since i was twenty years old .
it was very dark .
then what does he want with you ?
are you all right ?
i have n't had a chance to think . first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there . and after we got away , i 've just been dealin ' with him .
you ugly , great brute you , you have sadism stamped all over your bloated british kisser .
that theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- i was frantic -- i finished -- the last beat and ... ... i waited -- i listened -- but the applause did n't come -- nothing . a man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed , pimenov . we are dead -- it 's finished .
the men who came to see you at leavenworth . the one 's who made the arrangement ... who were they ? maybe i can talk to them .
i 'd like to jerk and press those babies .
she did . this photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive .
who do you think i am ?
she did that before .
i want to watch t.v .
where were you ?
he killed them ?
okay , give me the keys .
yes , ma'am . somebody had some trouble parking .
the same thing that always happens ! you blew it ! and this time you broke your son 's heart instead of mine ! he was so proud , looking forward to going to a movie with his father ... and you let him down ! like you let everybody down , always ! what did you do , take a mudbath ?
what ? another letter from your friend ?
insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure , mr. holland . but -- as miss connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case .
i do n't think you understand her . it is n't sex she wants , it 's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it .
i 've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day , jack .
you do n't think you 'll go --
no , you do n't .
you do n't give a shit about anything do you ?
detained by what ?
... tight !
i 'm at bleeker 's getting an appraisal on that diamond . i thought we might have lunch together .
she 's getting big . getting her own ideas .
bullshit . you had a vision . you got sign from the old ones .
you mean , before she sank .
they 'll love that .
you have some very primitive ideas , do n't you ?
screw off .
i do n't want to get in trouble .
you disdain accepted wisdom ?
no ... ! i have waited too long , fought too hard . now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit ! no ... i will not be your servant !
for her majesty .
anyway ... i ... the point is , mrs. mulwray . i 'm not in business to be loved , but i am in business , and believe me , whoever set up your husband , set me up . l.a. 's a small town , people talk .
what of it ?
rocco !
the driveway 's a few hundred yards up on your right .
business is good at the hotel ?
hey josie . it 's josie , right ?
i did n't forget .
i would , mr. doyle ! are you game ?
we were headed ...
i have no conviction , if that 's what you mean . i blow with the wind , and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy .
let 's do it .
ah , i see . that makes it all alright then .
to say the least .
you son thomas and virginia , they come to my house this afternoon ...
tuck in your shirt .
no ? how 's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them ?
is n't that special ? patrick ?
the poor whore 's suffocating in the heat .
and i 'm an old hand at following instructions --
i 've got a feeling we 're going to go the distance with him . let him sweat for a little while .
do n't ever do that again .
you 'd better hurry . i 've left amy in the car and she 's getting impatient . she tells me there 's something especially important about a sixth birthday .
i have a purpose .
dude , i wish you would n't do that .
hey , i 'm next .
what about money ?
i hope i never get that old .
no , it 's fine . thanks for making the call , i guess .
where 's plissken ?
... and what is this ?
we do n't allow tipn , ted .
smokes ?
it 's the greatest excitement in the world .
you are married , correct ?
look . i 'm ready to get the fuck out of here . it 's real torture for me to be here . getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans .
you underestimate the trap , mary .
yeah , you did . i told you not to but you did anyway .
that 's god 's way !
what 's landon carter up to ?
you 'll be all right ?
i 'm still here .
do they have him on display at the weekends ?
come on , dignan .
well that 's it boys , i been redeemed ! the preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions . it 's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting 's my reward !
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
i have n't seen him tonight .
never again , never again ...
... .with a woman 's touch .
the fairy queen ? and the baby here 's a princess ? and these two rodents are your guides ?
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points . must you flirt ?
i like the sound of that .
and you say this stuff , this hexavalent chromium -- it 's poisonous ?
easy .
floating to catalina .
knock it off , luke ! you cai n't talk about him that way .
shut-up .
hi , jerry . everything under control ?
your father dropped off an extra check .
you and candy ... ?
amy , i 'm not going to let anything happen to us .
then they do need me , do n't they . they really need me ...
what is this ? i got work to do .
you 're exactly right , andy . i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm. and now i 'm counting on your assistance too .
i 'm going to class .
you have to say that . you 're my student .
lennox hospital .
and hurry , they 're not looking too happy .
perfect . well then , shall we ?
it 's my wife .
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
my legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters . they were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day i was created . they will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day i go off line . my operation depends on specifications that do not change . i ... can not imagine ... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet ...
six years ...
oh , okay . here 's let me show you .
who 's going to pay for all this , sheriff ?
down to my car .
yes . i hated her for coming between my mother and father . she kept me from seeing my father . i went down there to ask her where he was . she would n't tell me , and i shot her .
no .
you saw that on t.v. , cole ?
joseph returns from the room where gis鑜e is . he has evidently succeeded in calming her . he goes and sits in the chair where nikolas sat . he rests his head in his hand . he sees the open diary and begins reading it .
excuse me , gentlemen .
hildy ! where 's mother ?
look , zeddemore , it was n't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line .
i do n't want to discuss it .
nothing about you .
hands ! come about ! jackets off the cannons ! we are to fire on our own ship ?
no , it 's just weird with him being such a brain and all , i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he 'd forgotten .
great !
it 's a nice idea . i mean it has style .
bundy . that 's the last one in your speech ...
why did n't you tell us about these guys , ian ? !
i hope that staying here wo n't be an inconvenience for you .
of course not ... but ... when i was a child ... i remember a dream ... . it was as if the whole sky was blue ...
did he give you anything ?
tradin ' your skins in castleton ?
meaning you do n't run as fast as you used to .
i must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . you know , we have so much in common 棗 we have such history together 棗i 've been thinking we should become friends .
walk outta there and tell her i was you .
but there was nothing , no one in the garden .
i 'll hang around in here . i 'll just be in the kitchen , mom ...
here 's my signature -- here preysing , sign here .
jeff -- is n't it time you came home ? you could pick your assignment .
dear mr. macintosh -- vanderhof , public relations . oh , yes , baxter . just a minute . all right , miss finch -- type up what we got so far . now what is it , baxter ?
great . classic timing . why do n't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce ? i 'll check my diary later .
you do n't know monsieur philipe ?
i 'm a doctor .
is it safe ?
now ?
no , i do n't suppose it has . he was broken up like nobody 's business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead .
do you know what this place is , ellie ? oh , i know you know it 's a boneyard , but a bone ai n't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em do n't amount to much . do you know what a graveyard really is ?
i got no ears ! i ca n't hear !
yeah , but --
i 'm minister malcolm x. two witnesses saw him brought in . he was not brought out .
get rid of 'em .
breaker . breaker .
yeah .
to the church , i must go there .
at least i 'm open to new concepts !
worried ! i was petrified . were n't you ?
none of these are ours . < u > none < /u > of em are ours ... . ... .that 's < u > real politik < /u > , buddy .
ai n't gon na be no weddin ' .
yeah .
you know , inspector , you take shit once , you take shit forever .
but sooner or later we 've got to end this relationship . and it 's better to do it right now .
maybe those russian dames would take him .
symington says ...
bummer .
look - denver be here in the day . i be here in the night . i 'm a take care of you , you hear ? starting now .
oh my , this is very interesting . say ... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts ?
no onions though , okay ?
yeah , but it did n't go so good . he was n't the man i thought he 'd be . theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup , but his hands are trembling , spilling some of the coffee .
no .
take the getty center exit -- make a right onto cisco . it 'll be a narrow winding road . you ca n't miss the house . it 's a mansion built back in '29 -- spanish -- boarded up since the quake .
it happens to me all the time .
girl , give it up ! we been friends too long to act like this .
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance .
i understand .
now i want you to do something for me .
well -- yes --
akta dedero ansila do mektet .
tried him once -
well , let me tell ya something , gon na clear your head right up . we are officially mexicans .
you have a real philosophy of life .
no dogs , huh ? okay .
thanks , josie . this was n't as bad as i thought .
i did not burn you . i did not give you up to anyone !
did i stutter ? the trunk . unless you want him riding up front with you ... but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go ...
i believe we 're being called to dinner .
get it .
gee , thanks !
yeah , i know . pour 'em short .
they 're drifting toward me ... i think they 're magnetic ! ...
captain willard -- go ahead .
that 's right , sir .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
anything ?
yes ?
is n't there an easier way ?
because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines ? i mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying , or people who are just god-damned sick of this world --
i ai n't talkin ' about you , i 'm talkin ' about me . and i 'm a-stayin ' . i give her a good goin ' over all night long -- and i 'm a-stayin ' .
right . little twerp thinks he 's colombo .
bob , i 've got nightmares .
what ? no . there 's no one here . i 'm just ... just ...
dad 's here .
we were going to start again , i think .
what ?
you told me that about the < u > last < /u > town .
tom .
it 's your roll .
she was randy 's only girlfriend . . . ever .
he 's weird .
yes .
what 'd you do , donnie ? what 'd you do !
oh migod ! i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to do that . it was an accident .
nice car .
oh , i see , right .
fbi , cia , nsa , local cops .
the vacant office . i see . olive oil . interesting . be warned , schwartz , there are certain 揹oors ? which should never be opened .
so long , nothing ! where 's bruce baldwin 's wallet ?
they were < u > mythic < /u > . they had a poetry to them . and you know what else ? the women prefer the traditional monsters .
i decided i was going to tell my husband about you today .
hey , i 'm not the one who 's been lying to my mother .
so . this is the guy you been waiting for . man of your dreams .
too bad . i likes you better with her . now , sometime you get maybe to artistic ; you wind up in the clinic tanks , spare parts .
a half mill on an eight to one shot . you 're dumber than i thought , lonnegan .
where 's your master ?
it 's you ... it 's you ...
so like , yeah匢 caved in . i mean , i had to . my parents , they 're like 卻till really depressed about brady . so i wrote the bullshit essay . filled out the applications , did the interviews匶'know , i figure i can always drop out .
i had to help get rid of the body . you saw it on the subway . and i warn you , mary -- go back -- you do n't know what you 're doing , or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister . you go back to school - - go back and forget jacqueline .
what does that mean ?
yeah .
granville 's looking for you anyway .
do you ever feel as though there 's always someone watching you ?
what 's the problem ?
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate .
is it like they say ? is he that good ?
wow ! this is like my dream room ! are these all records !
hey , you guys ...
i 'm stopping at the chatsworth .
yes ?
< u > that < /u > might be a < u > little < /u > < u > rough < /u > !
he 's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation . he 's high on my hit list .
no , we 're not knocking boots . i got this internship while i still was at nyu , dela was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant .
picked up something ? what is it ?
i just saw him . he 's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight .
i want to come home , of course i do , i 'd have to be mad not to want that . it 's just that marcus trusts me .
hey ! take it easy . want to get us killed ?
could n't we just get a computer to do this ?
nerves .
i asked my dad and bren not to narc us out to your folks , so we should be safe .
i 'm wrong here . i was n't meant to see this ...
hey , it 's in my locker , mr. hand .
who is it ?
you ca n't mean that . i 'm sure your bark is worse than your bite .
she 's there , just like i said she 'd be .
still play with dolls , doctor ?
but if it was n't billy it could be anybody . he could be here at school right now .
here you are , up with the birds for once , you vampire !
you sure ? she 's got kind of like brown hair .
would n't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime ?
i 'm butcherin ' my hog myself , smokin ' the hams , and cannin ' the sausage . you-all have your work cut out !
yes , i fed her . if she says she 's hungry , she 's lying to you . again .
i 'd say about thirty to forty minutes . give or take a few .
susan , dr. argon is giving you an opportunity here .
hey there , chief .
you hurt , daddy ! ?
igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain ? are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of hans delbruck that night ?
< u > please < /u > ...
thanks .
you know , in life you got ta strike when the iron 's hot .
yes , i do . in fact , my firm has box seats for the mariners . why do n't we all go next week ?
i did ?
and why would i do that ?
not one i should like to rely on . francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after austerlitz , and he is under great pressure to recover his losses .
one thing that has been troubling me . that lamp at the diner . do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring ?
what are you talking about ?
yeah , i know ... to save the world ... but right now all i want to do is save leeloo .
how ?
i know you 're thinkin ' that i got more'n some of my mama in me ? well , i could n't help it . sailor , i really could n't . i 'm sorry for that guy , but when he pulled that drippin ' hunk of awful-smellin ' meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies !
are you listening to me ? you 're in a world of shit . an eye witness has you outside the dead girl 's apartment . we got your prints all over the place . plus the fucking driver 's license , frank . you got ta give me something here . something i can believe .
are you remembering more ?
i do n't see no wedding ring , banks . conjugal visits are for married prisoners only .
but that 's my calling , my purpose , my raison d'etre . toons are supposed to make people laugh ... and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
no , i did n't mean that -- whatever that means . i mean , you just do n't look young enough .
maybe they needed it .
scotch coffee , canadian coffee , sour-mash coffee ...
hey , why do n't you just put a `` i 'm doing cocaine '' sign on the car . what is your fucking problem ?
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow ...
what are you looking at , out there ? there 's nothing to see .
i ca n't go to work with my hair dyed pink . and i can afford to go shopping more now , and i 've met a couple people i like over the last year or so .
i love my job . i love it . the next time i 'm having a bad day you got ta remind me of right now and i 'll get over it .
how about the new ending ? did you like that ?
you better not fuck this up . i 'm heavily invested .
and it 's horrible too . i 'm sorry jeffrey . that 's the way it has to be . anyway . i 'm sure you do understand .
... the coroner 's report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs .
taupin , richard marshall . born march 16 , 1945 in church hill , maryland . received first driver permit 1967 in philadelphia .
excuse me . did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience ?
what do we have here , margaret ?
do you remember me ?
i have a television .
god . that does sound corny . oh , your skin feels so soft and silky . but it really kind of does .
how un-sixties of you .
what is that ?
show him central park .
oh yeah ? i guess we still need to see that price tag . like art , right ? you hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle .
no .
right here .
it means killing benes ... and for all we know , they may have completed the operation ! damn it to hell !
ms. heller , mind if i tag along on your field trip ? i 'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class .
leave .
you bring me such peace ...
i 'll hang on to these . we do n't need them till we get to gollie玸 . okay . any questions ?
we 're here . where the hell are you ?
naw . but they will be . they 're the best .
want anything to drink ?
how good 's your intelligence ?
you did the same to your god !
you and your husband have been kind to me , alura . i have something to tell you : i 'm going away . soon .
not anymore . her parents found her hanging from a tree . her insides on the outside .
what for ?
... upset and impressionable ... get me the mayor ...
too bad your precious jack ca n't hear you ... the damsel in distress ... a rescue attempt would be most amusing ... we could flay sweet jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment ...
why ca n't we pick out our own colors ?
will you please call the chair people ?
i know ...
how lucky we are .
audrey , did you take the tape out of the camera ?
the clothes -- take 'em off -- i want to see every square inch --
well , personally , major , i will take what comes .
clyde fitch , thought you may not think so , was well before my time !
i 'm at the airport . why ?
restrain them from the targeting of civilians , including women and children ?
a blind girl can just walk out of here , and you do n't know who with ?
go ahead , shoot me . then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield .
hey , i been on the ramp all my life , so i got no problem with the way you help yourself , jake .
the rest of the family was crazy as rusty parr .
well ... i 'm going to go now .
no . it 's my life .
i 'll go ...
what bag ?
you know . look at me like -- like i look at women .
it 's okay , really .
yes . very much .
abbott . he knows about the embassy . he 's coming down for a show and tell .
a detective 's nightmare .
yessir .
oh -- did n't mean to talk like that in front of a lady . get some wine for the squire , belle .
tailgate me . i 'll jam on the brakes . you go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off .
you play the cello ! it 's my favorite instrument .
thanks for the diagnosis , ben . thank you . so let 's just go to this fiasco if that 's what you want to do . let 's just go on in . i 'd rather talk to anyone else but you .
let 's rest a minute . i 'm so thirsty .
it 'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes .
nah .
sure . maybe coffee .
i think i 'm dying . . .
what 's the big idea ?
come on -- it 's no use !
i 'm not going anywhere . less than a week to go . not on your life --
i think i 'll go for a walk .
yes , that 's true , but he refused to give the nazi salute . he kept his baton in his right hand . in hitler 's presence . that was a brave act ...
i ca n't jack . how can i ?
you 've got a private office here , have n't you ?
no , i 'm good .
oh , well , why did n't you say so ? and oh , i do n't know if you 're interested in this detail , but i was just about to tell you that i love him . i love him , and i do n't care what you think . i love him for the guy he wants to be , and i love him for the guy he almost is . i love him .
that 's father at work , what 'll i do ? peter , what 'll i do ?
there 's no other way , boys . i 'm going to have to take her in ... the hard way .
after they commissioned it , no one could ever agree on where to put it . the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church , the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church , the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall . everyone finally got tired of the fighting . so they stuck it down here .
where 'd you come from ?
what would you guess , ardelia ?
please .
still unknown but we 're running prints . kid over there caught the case .
she 's going to divorce me .
oh , but it 's a good story , shadow . you 're depriving our famous young friend here ...
richie said he was coming after me tonight .
how you figure ?
difficult , sir . this is , as you pointed out , a civil war .
you must allow us to act .
do n't go in .
it does .
four or five years .
congratulations .
if you were my son ... why do n't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup , it wo n't take but a minute .
listen , he 's my brother and i do n't want to start trouble ...
you keep hittin ' him like that , he ai n't gon na look like he broke in anymore , he gon na look like someone beat him up and then shot him .
is that your kind of reading , steve ?
now wait a minute ! this business about spock and mccoy ... honestly , i have never understood vulcan mysticism -- i 'm sorry ! but part of me does n't want you to make a fool of yourself ... understand ?
are you going to come tonight ?
that 's all you 've got to say ?
this does n't involve you , do n't you understand ? i ca n't even guarantee you any money out of all this .
shit ! he jumped !
but they will know about it , burke . from me . just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
you make it up , but it has to be believable . they call it suspension of disbelief .
just watching you .
do n't worry . take it . it 'll free your head . come on .
oh sure . it 's very rewarding ...
thank you , i 'll do that . good night .
got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters ... .
where do i sign ?
cease , can i ask you something ?
not too expensive -- i 'm not a lady of leisure anymore .
yes , sir .
i get it ! you want to make me beg , is that it ?
will you think about it ?
she was in pretty bad shape . they 've done a c.a.t . scan -- she has some hemorrhaging ...
benjamin , do n't you ever take that girl out .
ai n't they ?
he do n't look wise .
maybe you just need to give her some time . she 's so nice , brad . everybody loves lisa .
huh huh huh .
i am the demon from the bottomless pit ...
she 'll be fine , rosie wo n't do anything . at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time , about ... let 's see ... ... six hours from now .
mary rooney . she wo n't talk to me . i tried her at the hospital . i 'm going to try her back at home . read this .
okay . okay .
he thinks you stole his promotion . what exactly you doin there , john ?
where is it ?
only you ...
you know , nobody likes you ...
i must go where i can be of use .
let them fight .
oh , it 's wonderful .
you 're being served with a subpoena , mr. malloy .
hey , where 's your sweatshirt ?
no , he called late last night .
nope . maybe he skipped to rio . feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent . are you absolutely positive that one at e.s.u . is kaput ?
i hope you do n't think me daft . it 's important work . it 's part of a larger sociological experiment . i 'm federally funded .
we all deserve to wear white .
mmm ?
what choice do they have ? now they must serve us or starve .
i got lots of presents .

weeping willow with your tears running down , why do you always weep and frown , is it because he left you one day , is it because he could not stay , on your branches he would swing , do you long for the happiness that they would bring , he found shelter in your shade , he thought his laughter would never fade , weeping willow stop your tears , there is something to calm your fears , you think death as if you forever part , but i know he 'll always be in your heart .

i like to know who 's living in my house . i like to know what my boys are up to .
you got in late last night .
gentlemen , see this amiable youth ! he has been troubled by religious scruples , and has flown for refuge to my chaplin , mr. hunt , who has asked for advise from my wife , lady cosgrove , and between them both , they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith . did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple ?
theories ?
who 's inside , you or the shark ?
sure , i got ... i got nothing , uh , nothing till my analyst 's appointment .
i 'm sorry i woke you up .
there are some who call me tim ?
we 've certainly missed you .
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast ?
i do not deny its beauty , but it is a waste of electricity .

where we going ?
you remember , john , in '48 -- no one believed alger hiss was a communist . except me . they loved hiss just like they loved this ellsberg character . east coast , ivy league . he was their kind . i was dirt to them . nothing .
my , my , what a coil we 're in ! what 's this all about ?
you think we look like we抮e trying too hard .
it is day , of course , freya .
what about your husband ?
it 's not yogurt -- it 's mayonnaise .
you seen this girl ? say ... within the last 24 hours .
and if it should take more time to get through --
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?
my pleasure .
you too , michael ... .
yes , i know who he is .
if it does n't make any difference , why not just say it ?
suppose we do .
just a dirty window . next time , i 'll know how to handle a situation like that . let 's just hope that `` next time '' is n't too soon .
you carry my unborn sister in your womb !
what would be true , then .
you look better than ever .
actually , it 's probably more like $ 143.80 and one-half cent . there 's always fractions over in a big corporation , but they round it down to the lowest whole number .
afraid of getting caught ?
she 's fine . well , actually we 've broken up . it 's all over .
farley is already a tv winner as we shall see . dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene .
and if you have to kill somebody , kill them ! do n't stop to think about it .
`` welcome to eureka . ''
what would their reaction be ? i had n't the foggiest .
hurry up -- the salad 's getting warm and the pasta 's getting cold .
yeah , she 's a heelot just like the rest of them . it 's lucky you got away from her .
and the sheriff at the time was big charley wade . charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of sheriffs , he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county .
with time ... you get used to it . besides , when you hear from up here that there 's a full house and that people are laughing , having fun ... then you 're happy too . so i 've been wasting my breath ? you pretend to agree with me , but as soon as my back is turned , you do what you want ! get out of here ! i do n't want to lay eyes on you again ! this is the last straw ! your mother 's right , you 're crazy ! ! but how 'd he do it ? the little bastard ! by watching , he 's learned ! it 's incredible ! i 'm letting the box office know you 're not to set foot even into the theatre ! there are no more tickets for you ! and i 'm also talking to father adelfio ! you wo n't be an altar boy any more either ! ! ! you little runt !
you 'll be linked during the entire operation .
damn it , jim , what the hell 's the matter ? other people have birthdays . why 're we treating yours like a funeral ?
ah , love again .
james lee , you come in here and meet your daddy .
i do n't really like your friends either .
how old are you ?
coming to bed ?

you saw him , did n't you , dylan ! ?
i had another one of you guys down here from frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question . what 's this about anyway ?
o n't know what else to do . maybe i just do n't belong in her life . well - i 'm already out of her life .
ba fa goule you !
you 're not going to be there ?
i 'll tell you the problem . you behind the wheel . there 's your fucking problem .

she 's not !
i 'm just a little freaked , all right ? you got what you wanted , you know .
what you have to get personal about so quick ? all i mean is you could possibly read a book .
enough with the abracadabra .
he 's paying out in stacks of 25 .

good lord . what do you study in history ?
nine and-a-half years ago .
do you ever wish you had done it ?
nothing . heard you were in town .
the bearer of bad news .
sanderson ?
you 've seen him . you 're also familiar with how last week he died ?
where are you going ?
do n't you want dinner first ?
you抮e talking to their new vice president of mergers and acquisitions .
oh , yes , please .
why not ? !
hello , tracy .
i trust you ... besides , i do n't know if i 'm up for the amish today . you ca n't curse or spit or anything around them .
no , no , it floats . throw her in the pond tie weights on her . to the pond .
i 'm not here to bowl .
she 's a very groovy girl . that 's the problem .
you 're another one of these california boys . your friend here 's been tellin ' us about dope fiends .
i 'm really sorry .
and the seas would boil ...
be careful . there were people in that crosswalk .
o god . did romeo 's hand shed tybalt 's blood ? o serpent heart hid with a flowering face . was ever book containing such vile matter 's so fairly bound ? o , that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace .

anyone there ?
this is a big day for the guards . they get to remind us who 's boss .
i said i did n't want to do the sketch .
so you got a girl ?
i need to talk to you .

i went pretty good for a while , did n't i , al ? but ? i did n't stay in shape ? and ? 桰 had to take a few dives .
there 's the trinacria hotel ... or the regina , near the municipal building . as for rooming houses , i do n't know ...
no , just some crazy fucker . cut half his ear off .
i do n't have proofs of purchases from snacky smores , kenny !
i ca n't say i blame them . we 're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of ... creature .
looks like it . yes , sir .
i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .
theodore ? where are you ? are you alright ?
maybe . do you have a boyfriend ?
it usually is .
i 'll come back as soon as i can .
madam grusinskaya -- at once --
you were lucky . i spent three years in the pacific . i 've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies . why is that ?
missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world -- even mom said so . now there wo n't be any more because she 's gon na be dead forever !
who would n't .
shit . and you 're eating my burger ? you do n't eat meat .
i knew you were a little sick , but geez .
i 've been better .
yes , that would certainly do ...
yes ... i ... we had dinner .
what are you gon na do now if you do n't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more ?
this is no random killing , no one shot deal . the unsub has killed before ; he 's good at it . so what do we have ? we have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills : a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the fbi to know he exists .
who did you talk to ?
it did n't stop you from loving them . right ? or understanding them , or being able to forgive them ...
mr. scott ... on my next signal .
oh well , he met with like an accident . he passed away . alex becomes a bit weepy .
how 's that ?
orson , please ... it 's too bright

five thousand bucks ! i had it right in my hand !
as long as he gets out ok .
this is humiliating . we 're being ejected from a prom !
my jewish friend 's grandmother did .
i 've studied the case file , have you ... ? everything you need to find him is right in these pages . whatever his name is .
if that were true , i would not be here .
would you like to get some pie ?
that 's right , laugh about it ! you goddamn honkies are all the same !
patience my love , patience .
what could you find in this place ?
a severed wolf 's head on a pike as their symbol .
but surely ...
no . i think they are , were , just passengers . innocent victims .
i 've got troubles .
your stereo broke ? god , i could hardly stand that . i live on music .
well , i 'll be -- there 's a rig , turning in , by the gate .
you got something on your mind ?
that 's a tautology lad . if you say the queen arranges something , you 've no need to say she 's done it personally . that 's understood .
by fire . that 's the best way , really .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry i forgot the tent . i do n't think i forgot anything else .
stearns , harrington , you know who that is ?
let it go !
because we 're going there .
you saw it once . now you see it again . that 's life , is n't it ? and you were up here to try the same thing , were n't you ?
calm down and get in your position .
that 's how it 's going to be .
let 's get naked .
did my work please you ?
< u > how < /u > ... ?
left ... the one with the red dot .
no , no . you got leak .
tool ? tool for what ? we 've been going together almost two years !
not since we were kids .
indeed .
yes . he said ... `` do not try to make them understand you . ''
and ?
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth .
i had a feeling you would say something like that . so i brought us dinner .
oh , captain , they 'll always make lingerie , it 's one of the three basic needs of man -- food , shelter , silk teddies . miller dream on , private .
viridian ? what is ... ?
have you told gretchen about the spears ?
i 'd ask you to take me home , but i 'm a faceless sinner . ... you smell good , harry . familiar , you know ? i 'd ask you to take me home , but ...
that 's right - pour it on . talk me out of it .
i found something in my sleep . the friar who married them will take up their destinies .
i wonder if they 'd want to make it a quartet .
i 've got to sketch you .
it 's beautiful ...
better let me .
we 've got another two hours of daylight .
my problem mickey , is that you do n't exactly inspire empathy . i 'm all alone on this . i need your help . i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode . now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue . and i 'm tellin ' ya , mickey , he looks bad . the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court wo n't talk to us , which always looks bad . i have an interview with both the judge of your trial , bert steinsma , and the psychologist and author , emil reinghold , both of which discount the notion that you 're insane . you put that all together , and what the state is doing becomes obvious . but the network is n't satisfied . they feel the show needs another element . it needs you . in order to put the show on the air , i need to get an interview with you . you have n't talked to the press since your trial . now , a few days before you get transferred to an asylum , you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle . we 're talkin ' a media event here . every son of a bitch out the with a tv set 's gon na tune in to see that . we 'll make their motives so blatant , we 'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing . at least for a little while , the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies . well , whatta ya say ?
vada !
i 'm really rooting for this one .
i mean in show business .
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie . everything .
memory , officer starling , is what i have instead of view .
you be quiet , frank , we 're talkin ' . the adults are talkin ' . were you in the lockup for cuttin ' somebody up with a hatchet ?
right .
how much for the phone calls ?
i also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top .
who 're you kidding ? you can so .
look ... search your own records , if you prefer . you can do it a lot faster than us , anyway . if we find buffalo bill through your information , i 'll suppress it . nobody has to know this hospital cooperated .
it does n't matter . the publicity 's the main thing .
yeah .
yeah .
shu 's the only one i know of ...
i 'm already in town , but it do n't matter . we got dick in the bank . we dumped it all in harry 's movie .
-- turn the goddamn camera off !
liza , settle a bet for us .
ow , harold -- mom said not the head .
who needs dancing ?
hello .
did you throw away those fries , hamilton ?
i want you to trust me .
no . i 'm all right . it 's working .
listen ... do n't you worry about ed . he 'll come around . he 's too good a sheriff to let you give him the slip .
i hate pronouncing people dead over the phone . better , huh ? they 're fixed and dilated . he 's plant food .
shirley , get in here ! you got ta see this !
i 'm just curious . i can never tell what women think is handsome . is he handsome ?
apparently pretty high , we just got a new ceo last week .
hi , lins . i thought you were in houston .
who gets killed ?
duck !
where you goin ' tonight ?
stop it . he 's a nice guy .
i got kicked in the head , too .
move !
mr. roston ?
er , yes ...
warp speed , mr. sulu ...
no , that 's what i want to talk to the mayor about . we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued , screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you .
teach ! where the hell are you ? ! where 's our visuals ? ! !
my wife 's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things . and i 'm looking after them .
nice place . fulla velvet . even the bedspreads . damn ! two-fifty a pack and i go through 'em like toothpicks . twelve-and-a-half cents a piece , you believe that ?
whose side are you on ?
then it do n't work .
... that 's an old one .
what are we looking for ?
you 're in some deep shit pal , whether you know it or not .
... that 's what we finally decided .
there are trains leaving grand central every then minutes . a dozen liners leaving the harbor . get on one of them . go to singapore , scotland , manchuria , anywhere , just away from here --
algeria .
what ?
peter .
sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here .
me still . they left you alone ?
i 'm here to help you . reese , sergeant/tech-com , dn38416 ...
looks simple to operate .
you said it a million times !
i 've served with men like you before . methodical . systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?
ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now !
you must not act impetuously .
a hard left . a hard left .
point is , listen to them . they 've lost faith in old symbols . they 're ready to bond with you , the icon of the future . if it works , do n't fix it ...
sure you do ! no one reads ! ... listen , book publishing is n't exactly a bed of roses these days ...
oh yeah , i 'm really gon na eat carbohydrates ...
oh . all right . i'11 watch at home , then .
they do n't blame you . when a bank employee does this they understand . you get your life back . anyway i bet you hated that bank .
sit down , jack , i could weep . i really could . sometimes i think i 'll retire . just piss off to the bahamas and let somebody else employ them , glenda , get jack a drink . what is it , jack ?
do n't interpret that ! hold it . hold it . hold it ! slow , slow ! ! sheikh , do you mind ... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face mr. wallace ?
well , i think i 've had enough .
... yes .
i mean credit references , mr. roundy .
but i 've got a sports show . championship wrestling , at five .
hey , but did we get to you , klute ? a little ?
obviously , at this time , you were n't sick .
incidentally , joe , where 're you staying ?
no ?
i want you to know something . i was n't looking for just a fuck , if that 's what you 're thinking .
i do n't know what the problem is . plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
you 're not my type .
oh god ... oh god ...
you see , sarah ... here 's the problem . i know how smart you are , and i think you 're just telling me what i want to hear . i do n't think you really believe who you 've been telling me today .
amazing there 's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that .
more than you 'd guess . it 's just that we do n't hold coffee klatches . if more then three of us get together at any one time , the guys think it 's some kind of uprising .
wakin ' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin ' to me about things they do n't understand . callin ' me a bolshevik . i 'm an anarchist . it 's got nothin ' to do with bombs . it 's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom . you see that , do n't you ?
i appreciate -- a man as busy as --
ten o'clock tomorrow morning . i 'll be there .
that 's the second round i 've lost tonight . that fellow hurt me .
i got through .
it happens , larry . people make mistakes .
i think we should get something straight here . i was assigned to this office by the city .
you mean because what's-his-name .
a big , rich slob like d. b. norton buys a paper梐nd forty heads are chopped off !
well your people are getting in the way of my job .
but you did n't see it , right ?
i 've got a whole backpack full of clothes !
i think i know heather a bit better than you , okay ? if she was going to slash her wrists , the knife would be absolutely spotless .
okay . talk some more .
awww ... deep down i 'm a bastard , but when ya got eight kids ya ca n't make enemies .
well , it is a neighborhood tradition .
well she sure is n't normal .
oh boy , you 're gon na love this . take your time with this now . those files contain the details of every working artist in this country . those files are gon na tell us who joined the party , who informed and who was helpful .
the principal .
what are you doing here ?
i just got to town .
alright , we know who we 're looking for . play it cool until the time is right to make a move . let 's not pull any gangbusters shit or we 'll lose him again .
i think so ... they 've been talking to me about being tom 's managing editor .
`` i 'm getting trashed , man . '' is n't that what you 're supposed to do at a party ?
sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . right above your left ear .
aye . we 're good as inside .
um , i think the warren commission has been closed for a while .
always . except ...
... like love ...
in the arctic ice .
they were fucking called that before i was in it , okay ? it was n't my idea .
checking my pulse . it 's elevated . you enjoy frightening me , do n't you ?
you sound as if you hate it .
would i have called you if it was n't ? if there was any other way --
yes ... twice .
it all just happened so fast . we put that ad in the paper . i thought it would take months if , you know , ever and then -- boom -- two weeks later , she 's in our living room .
the yellow and pink .
mmmnnn ... ?
i ca n't wait to take a look . so what 's up next ?

it was like having snow in the house ... jesus , i miss them .
where 'd you get the bike ?
certainly not me .
do you mind if i use your bathroom ?
excellent .
rockin ' !
you need a doctor .
it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger . not their grief .
i know .
jawohl !
you 're damn lucky , glimpsing this country before it 's ruined , gone for good . you saw wonders you 'd only dreamed of . that alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from , because you have dreamt them .
brave clarice . will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming ?
there was n't any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and did n't leave no footprints in the hall . somebody musta wised him up .
my wife used to call me that .

why you left .
no thanks . just wanted to tell you that dr. st. luc is coming up to see nick at ten or so .
my poverty , but not my will consents .
imf mainframe .
that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you were n't a farmer ; get junior to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell junior to do it . boy , you ought to grow up .
counting the what ? what does that have to do with the price of butter ?
you 're needed here -- keep watching --
yes .
that 'd be great . hey , maybe someday your band 'll play there . it 's a college town , you know ?
come here .
our numbers are through the roof . the ipo 's tracking at fifty , sixty a share . the bank 's five times oversubscribed --
well , for one reason , we do n't have your other five thousand .
the best .
who are you waiting for ?
yep .
i 'm okay .
i doubt very much that one even exists .
tawny i think i 'm going to be sick .
maybe it is . why do n't you take a little stroll and see ?
that cop ! why 'd you have to do that ? you could n't wound him ? the guy had a family , maybe , parents , kids who got ta grow up without a dad , he was probably a good guy ; and he believed me ...
can i ask you something , mr. henry ?
just bought this beautiful antique ouija .
it certainly was .
scotty , do n't prejudge . a ship is a ship .
what do you add up to here ?
bye . and thanks ... nathalie gently closes the door , eyes lombard who shakes himself awake ... rolls her eyes and surveys the room ...
honest , mom , i saw him . it just opened up and he walked right in . and that great big iron man was moving around !
mr. leland sent back that check .
look , i did n't mean to give you a hard time .
you are afraid !
no . i 'm not badly injured . but my leg is very sore .
but only you will know he 's not human .
no , you 've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go .
mmmerrick .

i 'm frightened of you , bruce . i 'm frightened for you .

no .
she ever tell you she was thinkin ' of taking off ?
you 're lying ! you 'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything ! you 'll be killed the moment you 're seen !
this is something i should have done a long time ago , only i did n't have sense enough to do it . no , i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning . but no more . no more ! so that 's that .
that 's all right . i was afraid it was sweet sue . you wo n't tell anybody , will you ?
i just do n't want anyone to know it 's me .
yeah ? when was the last time ?
new york , frances ! broadway ! this is your chance ! you belong on the stage !
this may feel a tad awkward , my friend , but it need n't be . i 've merely come to oversee your work here ; understood ?
right . sorry .
maybe , yes ... maybe no .
hey , guys . how 's it going ?
i 'll be along .
what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings . you do n't like it , do you ?
freeze ! no `` worm-boy '' . no `` mr. worm , '' and no `` worm-master-general ! '' once you get a nickname like that you ca n't shake it . and i do n't want everyone thinking i 've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something , okay ?
then i 'd ask you what your terms are .
it 's not their fault .
i do n't have a clue .
yeah , for now . our first priority 's to get something to breathe .
i 'll call you right back .
... and while they are cooped up in your fort , what if the french send war parties to raid their homes ?
and why not ?
something stupid .
the army is a problem . they love you . you have led them from victory to victory in the name of rome and they love you . and after all , you 're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that ? thus have i reached a compromise with the senate over your fate : instead of executing you , i 'm sending you to rome where you will be tried ...
get your kicks somewhere else .
yeah .
i have to take the car .
a man scared me .
and this has what to do with me ?
say not here ! cuba !
watch out ! !
at least help raoul .
no , it is n't out of your hands or you would n't even have met me . if i push you have to let me back in . dead hero father rule . sir .

your alien had a room in the holiday inn ?
they love me , darling ! `` craig schwartz is fantastic ! '' the new york times . `` if only craig schwartz had always been inside malkovich ! '' women 's wear daily . `` craig schwartz - the world 's greatest puppeteer ! '' paul wunder , wbai radio .
plissken , slow down the sub . you 're overloading the power plant .
it 's really quite something to see you all grown up like this , enid . i 'd love to hear about what you 're doing . i ca n't help but feel that i had some small part in how you turned out ... what are you studying ? you were always such a smart little girl .
racist piece of shit .
well , we have to end apartheid for one . and slow down the nuclear arms race , stop terrorism and world hunger . but we ca n't ignore our social needs . either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system . we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women 's freedom of choice .
you have been lonely ?
what do you think , sal ? jesus , you think we 'd miss this ?
this is crazy .
sir , this is not a lending library , it 's the hall of records .
hey , man . jeff . how 're you doin ?
what ? no frigging way , man . i 'm not touching that thing .
because it seemed stupid and foolish .

that ai n't bad .

what 's wrong ?
sometimes you just have to -
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back . see , you ca n't do anything to make her want to come back . you can only do things to make her not want to come back .
no , he 's ruining yours .
possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - vanity fair -
i 'd like to have a word with you . this is agent matheson , fbi .

yeah .
yeah , tangerine ?
he 's a gentleman . gentleman gambler . he gets his kicks playing with hustlers . he 's got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement , drinks eight-year-old bourbon , smokes cork-tipped cigarettes .
why do n't you come back tomorrow , son ? ever been booked before ?

that 's okay , that 's okay , that 's okay ? that 's just fine . you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap , thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium , maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn . you were dead wrong . we 're only interested in one thing : can you tell a story , bart ? can you make us laugh , can you make us cry , can you make us wan na break out in joyous song ? is that more than one thing ? okay . the point is , i run this dump and i do n't know the technical mumbo-jumbo . why do i run it ? i 've got horse-sense , goddamnit . showmanship . and also , and i hope lou told you this , i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town . did you tell him that , lou ? and i do n't mean my dick 's bigger than yours , it 's not a sexual thing ? although , you 're the writer , you would know more about that . coffee ?

gomez , you fight the battles you can win . now , we 've been outmaneuvered here . brynner 's next move is gon na be to get elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder . to do that , he has to have planned an exit point . that 's where we intercept him . that 's where we make our play . now you and your men back off .
who 's flying the fucking plane ?
call the fbi . use a pay phone . do n't give 'em your name , dad . just tell 'em that it was shepard who killed finelli and clark and the others . that he 's the nightingale .
i mean i 'd -- i 'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in . i just have a toothbrush . i can get it myself . if that 's all right .
i 'm late .
come to the rescue again i see .
nah .
i wish everyone would stop commenting on my health . i 'm the doctor .
but mom , the video 's not over .
that 's my line .
it reminded me of you , so i bought it . it cost me more than all the others .
taking out what you should never have put in .
too late . i spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it i just sort of blew it in .
how similar in build you and i are . then i figured it . you bump me off , throw me in the car , and burn me up .
like what ?
the twenty third of january . on that night one of our elder nuns passed away .
egg foo young . stand up .
bob ...

hi kid , you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark .
it 's a shame . he 's such a rest actor , and nobody uses him anymore .
cinderella man ! babe , you stuck a tag on that hick that 'll stick to him the rest of his life . can you imagine cobb 's face when he reads this ?
different culture . hard to penetrate . the indians do n't like white cops poking around . and that 's why we 're in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent .
asleep --
yes !
i know . i have heard noises and echoes through the stones ...
i ... i never lied !
well , just keep looking . it 's got ta be ... whoa , jesus !
i hesitated for what seemed like forever .

yes ?
poison gas .
i ca n't talk now .
well , you know ... that 's the thing . like i said , just about everybody in town works for me . and it 's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you . it 's like an order or something ... and no one -- no one -- asks me .
is n't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot ?
maybe . we 'll have a little talk first . then ... .maybe ... i can help you out . string him up .

no , it 's for the best , it really is . we were so wrong for each other .
do n't you get it , gus ? if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she would n't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley . it gives her the motive to kill nilsen .

monday .
this is n't punishment , i do n't believe in punishment . it 's for your health . obviously you 're sick if you can act like that .
oh yeah ? wan na arm wrestle ... ?
sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world . except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe . they 're so perky , i love that . but that 's not what he said . he distinctly said `` to blave . '' and , as we all know , `` to blave '' means `` to bluff . '' so you 're probably playing cards , and he cheated
down the street and across . greely 's beer garden and billiard parlor . just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards .
come , come , sheriff , lightning does n't strike in the same place twice . nothing 's going to happen .

you know , most movies that win a lot of oscars , i ca n't stand . `` sophie 's choice '' , `` ordinary people '' , `` kramer vs. kramer '' , `` gandhi '' . all that stuff is safe , geriatric , coffee-table dog shit .
i was a minister .

what are you doing ?
levi , you got about four hours before armed men show up here , put you on a plane to washington , and lock you in a very small dark room . i suggest you talk to us .
do n't know much , do you ?
they always pick rachel up early on thursday .
close ... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings i pulled .
wait a minute , joe . lets talk this over . why could n't we do it ? last year , when we played in that gypsy tearoom , we wore gold earrings . and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band ? grass skirts !
because i do n't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours .
ah , they set out across the desert this afternoon . i believe they took mister brody with them .
how old are you ?
mine !
while you went off for a few beers with your friends ? is that hettie rodgers there , with whatzizname ?
hello ? yeah , baxter . what 's up ?
well , no , look ... i mean , there was a footprint . forget it . it 's probably not important at all . you know , i got a job now . i 'm teaching high school . japanese and chemistry . so , what were you calling about ?
whose blood is that , jay ?
he would have . you were his best friend . a better friend than me .
getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and < u > him < /u > ... she did n't even look at him .
we have to press home the attack !
marty ...
without me .
do you believe in miracles ?
safe , shit , he 's got a gun ! getmeout . get me out !
honey , a couple of years ago , with jane and frankie ? -- jane sent me a dumper --
or just drunk enough . he was with her when she registered . he knew where her room was . you were out most of the evening . there was a lot of mess to clean up . waiters coming and going , the door standing open . suppose mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself , then wandered out on this balcony , then realized betty 's balcony was just below yours .
you mean they were n't up here ?
i have a wonderful disposition , i put people right at ease .
that 's what makes you interesting . as a teacher .
if you 're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty , forget it .
emergency transmitter ? all your gear is back at wilder 's .
she 's worried about you . and , quite frankly , so am i .
the jews clearly control the media and the banks . investment banks , not the commercial ones . but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality . they undermine traditional life ; they deracinate society .
did you straighten her out ?
that is bullshit ! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho . i ca n't believe you 're saying this , marylin ! there 's nothing wrong with us . we 're attractive and charismatic and successful and ... i like us .
can you at least pretend to be like you used to be ? give me some comfort ?
lemon does n't go in gin and tonics , darlin ' . where ya ' from ?
what was he in jail for ?
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me .
you are fair as the first new flower of spring ...
no ... maybe that 's not the case . maybe she should n't be such a smug little shit because she 'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is , but it 's been a long time and he does n't know if he 's ready to ...
my baby .
could i ask you , please , to paste you paintings into my book ? i should like to have them . i should be honored .
what 's wrong ? are you alright ?
that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms & families ... major heyward was at john cameron 's . he saw what it was .
new way ? what 's this about a new way ? there 's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back , and no error . let me hear more .
i lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father . he took me all over the world .
we 're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he ca n't just walk outside !
there 's taking money and there 's taking money , you know that . he 's taking money .
right . hal , tell me whether the following statements are true or false .
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause . well , i am also a human being .
the south pole . time箂 flowing backwards .
well , for the last week , anyway ! he 's kind of a kid . kind of a goofball , but he 's really stuck on me , which is flattering . who would n't like that ? and he 's , like , a dope , but he says these smart and moving things sometimes , out of nowhere , that just break my heart . he 's the one who gave me that crow photograph .
fine , then how many nights home is that ?
they 're here .
saluting .
you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it , doctor..
i was reamed , steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys ... and now you want me to go back out there ? forget it .
... a puny player on the great world 's stage ...
caitlin 's on the same wave-length ?
i never thought of that .
cartman , over zere , is the electrical box . you must sneak over zere and shut it off before i return with terrance and phillip or the alarms will sound and i will be shot full of holes . got it ?
look , i do n't need to hear any of this working class hero crap . some party boat skipper who 's killed a few sharks ...
please ... i don know what to do . i 'm so cold .
when can we expect containment ?
believe it or not , i actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me . i 'm not quite sure how i did it . i 'd hate to have to do it again . but i did it . wan na say hi to my better half ?
because you 're it . and if you tag me ... then i 'm it .
of course .

yes ...
he 's the only one who can operate this --
what do you think of that piece of scenery , yankee boy ?
alright . i want you to leave and go back to new york .
we 've learnt about life as truman has and , despite the complaints of a minority , it 's been an overwhelmingly positive experience , for truman and for the viewing public .
... i hope you appreciate my spendin ' six hundred dollars , not countin ' what it cost us to get here and back ... this man 's the best damn abortionist in the south .

oh , there 's a hard tale , jack . most of the decent pirates in town wo n't sail with you -- seem to think you 're a jinx .
no -- i was just thinking -- look -- it 's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else .
they 'll probably make a run for the border , which would bring 'em this way . and if we get our hands on those shit asses , we 're talking payback time . we 'll get 'em all right . i got ta piss . i 'm gon na use your commode .

you just sit tight , old man . we 're gon na have to get you to a doctor . i 'll call a cop .

i hate to be a bother , john , but the cramp 's getting worse . the pain is actually quite unbearable now .
yes . yes .
... out at the airport ...
is that all ?
this is such a street of whiners .
you gave me an hour ; now give me a day .
if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this .
so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.i shall be fulfilling a citizen 's duty .
wow . you do n't fool around , do you ?
... then what about ...
you 'll move
tell me something : why can < u > i < /u > hear you , when the others could n't ?
i 'm not talking about that . i 'm talking about rocco lampone building a secret regime . why does neri report directly to you , rather than through me or a caporegime ?
and i never will- you know what 's between us ? we 're a thing but this is serious competition .
yes , i 'm with the underhills .
good night .
i guess it was a long time ago .
where 've you been ? i 've got to give evidence in court at nine .
you look beautiful to me .
catholics . what do you expect ? oh , well , what 's in a name , right ? let 's go inside and have a look at that cake .
outbid by my own wench , quelle bummere .
oh ... i 'm fired ?

ah ! here she comes . fraulein lorl , good morning .
-- then perhaps for the lady . the ring is quite unique .
just about . you see , i also have this amazing strength ...
teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline .
did you know that if you shut someone up in a room , and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four , that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule ? simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four , the body follows . and then there are sections of time . your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . for instance , when i was twelve , i had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship . now , i 'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time , but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to , and then were crystallized in , that eleven minutes .
for how long ?
i said nothing before , for fear you would n't believe me . i 've exorcised forces from this house . eliza knew , she was there . it wants another soul , the one we 've taken away . we must weaken it !
i think it 's my safest bet , do n't you ?
mr. mystery guest . are you still there ?
that 's not dirt ... ca n't be dirt.. dirt is a violation .
well , say something - anything ! congratulations , skol - good work , eve !
i 'm totally freakin ' dude . i keep having these nightmares , then i wake up screaming with these awful back spasms . i ca n't take it anymore , man .
it 's okay . no problem . where should we sit ?
where are you taking us ?
you 're gon na get through it , but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl . we get adler and we beat this thing .
how do they know ?
since we hardly know each other , i 'm sure you 'll understand if i hold one to it for awhile .
what exactly do you mean by `` almost any time now '' ?
margo , darling . you washed me up . remember ? we 're just friends . you wanted it that way .
there , what 's that place ?
i came to see you .
we 're very upset with her . get someone to < u > double for her < /u > , her tits , the tits scene , call l.a. i want to see some < u > pictures < /u > of the women 's < u > tits < /u > . of their < u > tits < /u > .

the enterprise can be at your position in two days , admiral ...

it 's been two years . he 's probably in trouble again .
maybe you 're right .
did n't you hear stoltzfus ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they 'll say we broke their laws ?
why ?
i ai n't tellin ' ya nothin ' . i 'm just sayin ' what i 'd do .

if we could just get the < u > creature < /u > into the lifeboat , we could launch it into space and blow it up .

what 's that guy 's name ? sue ?
well , you boys do what you want . i just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday .
just one question . since dr. argon no longer has feeling below his waist , how is it that you 're still able to do your job ?
whose death ?
you got ta be kidding ! this is unfuckingbelievable ! i have to start the evening crawling down capital records , i shoulda chose suicide then , but oh no , the night was young ! next up , my guitar ! the second most important thing i own and now it 's toothpicks for the homeless on hollywood boulevard ! then , then , after i burned up your brother , jazz ... i should say as a fucking footnote i 've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages , the wet spot , you know giving out domino 's pizza 's phone number and saying it 's mine ... tonight was different . i felt respect . i felt love . then jazz left me ... and < u > now < /u > i get to die !

who were they ?
he 's `` discovering '' india .
this has nothing to do with me -- but always remember , purser , when you 're searching anybody , take the lining of their coat , like this -- -- run your fingers all along these seams ... . then -- back of the collar -- < u > here < /u > -- that used to be a favorite trick -- and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe -- like this .

forgery ? fraud ?
did we ever really think it was suicide ?
we wo n't .
do you ? even assuming you 're able to prevent ambrose selling chimera , you 've now got an additional problem . you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte . if ambrose is going to sell chimera now , he 'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss hall 's blood to market .
yes , ma'am .
that what you want ?
please tell only who you must , i do n't want to be responsible for a panic . and get to a boat quickly . do n't wait . you remember what i told you about the boats ?

'' i was so scared i woke up my parents . they told me it was just a dream , to go back to bed . but the next morning , my aunt stacy was dead .
you 're so responsible it 's disgusting . but you 're my only friend ... do you hate me ?

new one on me . okay . let 's see him .
i seen a man die . he could n't breathe ... his heart was ... was givin ' out .
we just talked .
no ... you go in there , i 'll have to kill you .
that was the order , mr. sulu : clear the bridge .
simple . we sedate him , induce a somnolesent state , and study his rem patterns when he 's unconscious . if he has the disorder , his rems will be highly abnormal . ruby smiles .
i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes .
look , i care about the humans who are dying , not you , got it ?
well , he 's in trouble and he did n't even get here yet .
it 's coming along . at the rate he 's going , he 'll have a story finished by the end of the summer .
yeah , all right , do n't tell me , i 'll go along with it , it 's just irritating to me i ca n't figure it out .
a what ?
you , too ? my name is betty mayfield . i was born , and i am here . message ends . that 's what i told him . he did n't like it .
i 've got ... one last number for you , theo ...
i got to get going . an agent is showing me a house up on broad beach in ten minutes .

eric ... you ca n't be like me . you have to be better . i 'm not the guy you think i am ...
with a trombone hooter like yours it 'd be unnatural if you did n't .
what-what-i do n't ... it 's not natural ! we 're sleeping in a bed together . you know , it 's been a long time .
yes .
it 's a missing persons case ... a long shot . i 'll give it two months , two months at most , then i 'll be back . we 'll take a vacation .
if it 's any comfort to you , i do n't think you 're crazy .
mike ?
come , i 'll take you home .
you said you had it all lined up .
fuck you , george . i knew you 'd say something like that . always thinking about yourself .
they barely talk anymore .
what ?
but what --
yeah , ye -- i -- uh , there were , earlier , there was that guy carrut --
how do i know you 'll keep your word ?
magic .
but they were n't mine .
i hate to admit it , but there 's something perversely satisfying about this .
we can work .
who cares ?
barzini .
make it twenty .
come on , let 's dance .
i did n't think she 'd dare come back to peking !
true .
a think wire -- -but very , very strong . let 's get out of here .
this is yours ...
stephen , i 'm kinda busy here , can we talk about this later ?
oh . sorry .
you said he had two days ' start . that he would blend in . disappear !
it does n't mean anything . do n't pay attention to him .
go ahead .
wednesday at the park . we 've got a lot of names coming in ...
unlikely . all 14 cameras are frozen . do we call randy and phil ? tell 'em there may have been a break-in ?
what else ? you ever look over this town 's history ? not a safe place to be a teenager . anyway , if i 'm next , watch your back .
war games ? thailand ? that 's not true ! how can you believe that ? ca n't you see what they 're doing ? it 's all a lie . we were in da nang , for god 's sake . you 've got to believe me .
yes mam ... we got ta go , miss boatwright.. .
we wo n't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck ...
there 's a couple of points i keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you . buddy is it ? and this fella jack foley . i swear the man must 've robbed two hundred banks in his time .
ok , i guess .
bullshit . that boat has n't made steam for fifty years . we found her . she 's ours .
thanks , franky .
shit , if kristin had to get married where i could afford it , we 'd be holding the reception at buddy 's burgers .
no !
he drank it hot ?
up the trail .
yeah .
you mean my other self ...
jenny greenteeth ? who 's she ?
where you been hiding , dick ?
there is a kind of shark called a great white shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater .
hah hah you 're funny . a bath . like a brother and sister . oh man , i 'm so wasted .
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality .
i lied to you , i did n't destroy the floppy disks .
the sea is lovely , dark and deep .
but he 's the head of ingen !
excellent work , puff . extra desert tonight .
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind .
yes , i 'm very hungry .
what 's it say ? a hundred and two ?
the president 's in europe . tomorrow he 'll be in turkey . right along this fault line . they launched the space shuttle yesterday .
what does he mean , too correct ?
mocky-lock .
well , that 's what the law 's for , is n't it ?
it 's feels unreal , like butterfly wings or ... something . it must 've cost dr. gaskell a lot .
whoa . remind me .
no . tonight . it 's important !
bertrand . clay bertrand ?
well ... just meet her .
just promise you 'll love me even if i end up in a job where i have to wear a blue polyester cap .
with you there 's a tragic dimension .
oh , mom 's okay . they 're just givin ' her a ride back . she almost blew outta the back of loretta 's pick-up on the way over .
that 's a pretty stylish skirt , rose . the only thing i do n't understand is how did you ever get it on .
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son .
true . i guess she had n't completely given up hope . are you sure you 're seventeen ?
ouch..
now ? now ?
you know , you 're no longer required to come here .
-- shut up ! -- just shut the --
the final countdown .
now this is for ritalin . ten miligrams a day .
go on !
i do n't believe you , margaret . frank was n't like that . i 'm the villain in the family , remember ?
i had to get back to the desert . i made a promise . the rest meant nothing to me .
cause i had a bad dream about him . i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr. crandall buried him in the pet sematary .
you should really let a doctor look at that .
not exactly .
just so you know , i think they recalled these cars in 1974 .
fry 'em .
i do n't care . you pick .
i just took a shot at it .
maybe you better hear what i got to say first .
what a loser she must be . anyhow , court 's invited me to the hamptons for labor day weekend .
can i give you a lift ?
[ was it ] & quot ; meirschultz & quot ; ?
sweltering . come on , i 'll take you home .
i 'm talking about survival . yours , mine , all of it . outside and in . you got to do something for me . staying alive might depend on it . the pigs are gon na try to infiltrate us and we 're gon na let 'em . but their spy 's gon na be our spy too . how about it ?

i do n't know . i barely made it today .
all right . be careful .
wagner ...
quiet , please . everyone .
ok , do n't panic ; let 's think about this .
what ?
a tragedy . but that was a boating accident ; no bites , no sharks , nothing but a boating accident .
and think to yourself -- `` there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home . ''
but one day i 'll catch you ... like i caught her ...
again .
it wes a dream ... !
then you 're sleeping with dreiberg ?
... that 'd be my guess .
forgive me , don colon . but what about gold ?
it 's all right , i forgive you . i 'm not the vengeful type . we 'll forget what happened . why do n't we take a trip together ? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas .
you are not regarding it in full . the widow windsor had been run through by a sword . i followed the bloodless wound , a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes .
what ?
i wrote a poem too .
if ever i meet him again , you shall see which is the best man of the two . i 'll fight him with sword or with pistol , captain as he is .
we do n't have to see him . call that halfassed army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid 's esophagus and take x- rays .
twenty-five .
do you realize that you 're accusing me of ... .
hey , wait , where 's bee-bee ? bee-bee ! bee-bee , where 'd you go ? did you guys see where she went ?
i 'd seen him in a coffin so many times , i expected him to jump out ...
urrggghh ...
that 'll work . i just bought one for myself .
cider do n't have no taste till later in october -- it 's too watery now , when we 're usin ' just them early macs and them gravensteins . you do n't get no *good* cider till you 're pickin ' them golden delicious and them winter bananas , them baldwins and them russerts ...
please understand , the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines .
tell that to jack vincennes . to stensland .
how do you like this couple , max ?
do i look that obvious ? my name 's paul .
habit , mostly , just like this .
only in passing . to say hello to .
where could it have gone ? how could it get across the water ? they 're only lions , yes ?
you know who the raincoats are ?
it 's okay .
did you ?
we could use about fifty more men here .
yeah , thanks for going back to hell for us . you 're a real pal .
that 's the code word . i miss you , peaches .
... to target at ban kia na . we probe the site ...
yeah .
that 's correct , doc ...

cargo hold , everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo , lesgo , lesgo .

a week , max . okay ? okay ?
i 'd forgotten how much music meant to you .
what was that ?
i guess they do n't build them like they used to , huh ?
who told you that ?
stand on a stepladder sometimes .
do you think this cross will protect you ?
and you 're so beautiful . what are you doing here ?
it 's no my fault i was born first . besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .
it 'll take us to budapest if you 're not careful .
-- we 're in the middle of a trade meeting ! --
... too early ...
... you knew you had a double ?
well you have to tell them . what if something happens ? we 're actors , not astronauts ... we ca n't do this stuff !
it 's not cool . it 's commie bullshit !
we have n't checked .
i never said he was my dearest love . and yes , he will save me . that i know .
where am i ?
you should n't . you should n't trust anyone ... certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself . not the young federal agent who wants your job . not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he 's created . do n't trust anyone . just find the minority report .
hi .
you seem to be saying that this is n't just a case of resting until i 'm better . that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life .
yeah , honey , someday everything 's gon na be all right .
are you uncomfortable with my appearance ?
so it looks like a burglary attempt . you catch me . i get the gun , and shoot you .
the telegraph office .
unless it 's an act .
my client ca n't walk , your honor .
five million dollars ?
it 's warm .
do i have to ? who 's the little girl ?
here is my gold . worse poison to men 's souls , than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell .
what am i supposed to do ?
and cosgrove . coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate . they were n't very high on seagrave , either .
who the hell knows !
why do n't you come home with me ? i mean nobody 's home at my house -- and i 'm not tired , are you ? i do n't have many -- people i can talk to .
ludwig .
my god ...
allez , allez !
oh , now , i 'm afraid that 's been exaggerated some --
well i have it worse than cramps . goodnight gregory .
no .
what did you do while the sergeant was killing your son ?
if i were to spare a few policemen , where would i station them ?
you watch the draft this year ? 'course you did n't , idiot question . they try to make it dramatic , like there 's some big surprise who picks who in the first round ? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months . doctor 's reports , highlight reels , coaches ' evaluations , psychological profiles -- hell , i would n't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys , have 'em analyzed . all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad . compared to that , what you know about the person you get married to do n't amount to diddly , does it ?
dad !
krueger is reality .
you 're testing me ?
yes , hindu dances , thank you , sergeant . this is the first opportunity we 've had of making an american author welcome .
such a shame .. she 's a really sweet kid ..
no .
like what ? be a rock star ?
we were -- i was just so tempted ... it was sort of a test . i think after sleeping with benito i know i want to be with george . but now george knows about benito and he does n't want to be with me !
what facts are those ?
do you have a mirror ? it 's the best way to see if someone 's breathing .
we will , old fried , we will .
what are you telling them ?
boomerang .
that 's nice .
i always think you 're cute . i think you 're beautiful .
oh , what bullshit ? what , do you want to fuckin ' talk it over now ?
is it true phil ?
i 'm afraid , prof. nothing makes sense . please help me .
then try harder , mozart . i have no intention of dismissing you . you will remain in my service and learn your place . go now .
oh .
those ai n't cops .
calm down ... give the gun to me . you 're out of control , son .
... those limp-dick ... < u > turncoat < /u > ... i < u > thought < /u > they let us out of there too easy ... ..
i do n't under --
it 's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck . if i wanted to turn toward catherine , for instance , i 'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around ... ... like this ...
why 'd he do it ?
what ?
i did n't say braze .
to be a jedi , luke , you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father could n't get past . impatience is the easiest door - for you , like your father . only , your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door , and you have held firm . you 're no longer so reckless now , luke . you are strong and patient . and now , you must face darth vader again !
i know .
i 'd like to hear it .
i 've never been looked at like this by a woman .
no .
lord vigo , the mother , dana , is fine and strong . i was wondering -- well , would it be possible -- if i bring the baby , could i have the woman ?
well that 's good . i 'm happy to hear it .
i do n't want to take my shirt off in that con ... what are these things that they 're asking of me ... ? wha ... wha ... wha ... i try to be good ; the only thing i care about is ...
chick --
you 're him ! you 're corvis ! we fried your ass . you 're dead , man !
how are the rooms ? comfortable ?
he 's mistaken .
zero body count .
i 'll try to remember that , marchena ...
yes , in the third act .
we do this . then . you 're finished . then . you 're clean
you 're sure ?
or perhaps they 're on the surface .
what ?
oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? ''
nancy went bonkers from this thing . you would n't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic ?
i 've got what i need for my report . there is ... there is one thing that bothers me though .
i think we 'll have to shave the hair . deke , have you got a razor ?
mean ?
it 's true , sir , the water has been turned off .
i forgot how cute you look . when you get impossible .
lydia 's trying , but they do n't believe her .
except , if he does n't come out of the hotel .
mary ! i 'm -- selectman of cross corners !
no . i only hoped that your knowledge -
i do n't know , debo .
have n't you anyone -- have n't you anybody -- you -- i mean -- are you all alone in the world .
for what reason ? some personal satisfaction ?
why are you doing this ?
everybody makes their own fun . f'you do n't make it yourself , it ai n't fun , it 's entertainment .
low calls him suspect zero .
dylan ? he 's holding well . earlier he had some problems , he 's in an oxygen tent just now ...
those kids seem to be getting along fine ! --
and what is that ?
bam ! that walker colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end .
trent , i do n't feel like going out tonight . i got shit to do tomorrow ...
swell !
aye , lad ... we 've little else to go by .
well , it was n't me . mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he 's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and ... you said the good doctor was with you .
no . it wo n't do .
sleeping .
oh , yes . will you help me fold these , please ?
she 's a malaysian dream warden . she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams . need one ?
dorothy told me you were here . i was going to telephone but ... .

more than that .
if you must know , yes . i do n't know what to do . i ca n't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet , i 'm completely infatuated with her . she made me laugh .
it 's those files you asked for .
christy . christy van cartier .
jordan !

that 's why he called mr. sisler first . he was one of them .

it 's so pitch-black tonight . i feel lost .
plenty treasure inside ... jimmy seen it once .
'cause that 's a serious thing you 're sayin ' . i mean , we might be in california next week and you could find out somethin ' about me that you do n't like . and you might feel like `` hey this is a big mistake . '' but you ca n't take it back , 'cause you know it 's real serious and you ca n't take somethin ' like that back . now i 'm in california , 'cause you asked me to come . but you do n't really want me there . and i 'm stuck in california with someone who really does n't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back .
i know , i know all the arguments , you do n't have to tell me . that 's what i did all night -- i `` listened to the voices of reason '' till the dawn came up . do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you 've been up night crying ?
how long were you with the girl ?
you got < u > that < /u > right !
i get so irritated with daddy . he 's so dumb sometimes .
the things that go on .
and leave all this ? not in a million .
i do n't know about you , but i feed off my emotions .
come on .
stuttering stanley !
why do n't you shut the fuck up ?
howard --
no , i mean whereabouts .
sometimes i wonder if it 's worth it . busting my ass , for what ?
listen sarah , i think i know what 's going on ok. i went to the waxwork today.i met this man .
do n't think about it too long . you had enough ?
what the fuck are you doing here ?
even sonny wo n't be able to call off luca brasi .

oh , that 's a sad story . and her husband is that little fellow , works in peter reeves .
ooo , she 's thinking of her date ! come on , you 've been dating a pilot . we want to know what we can expect .
... my dad was a compulsive gambler . only he did n't think he was . that applied to guys who did n't have a `` system . '' `` losers , '' who played games of chance . he could `` read '' people , so chance had nothing to do with it . no matter how deep a hole he dug himself , he 'd give you the whole speech . and you 'd better not point out the obvious . his creditors would catch up to him . loan sharks or whatever . he 'd wake us in the middle of the night . off we 'd go , again .
i dunno .
well , at least you still talk the same .
we know , audrey .
i do n't mind .
for me ? okay .
oh yeah , since when ?
i 'll take you up on that .
it seems that you and i have some talking to do .
well ... i just kept wiping that dish . maybe it does n't sound very sexy but it was .
ma'am , i 'm as gentle as a puppy dog . why , i have n't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks ! hi ya , doc !
it 's a short film .
you wo n't get hurt ...
frank ... what 's wrong ?
are you glad ? i 'm glad .
he 's gone .
what 're you gon na get out of it , huh ?
sometimes it helps to talk things over . for instance , many marriages are saved by .
sure you are .
may i go to the cinema ?
a revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor , citizen lieutenant . one does not call it murder to kill such vermin .
that 's your domain .
i 'm sorry , mr. gardner . i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone .
here . put this on . you examine him .
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
no wonder he was angry .
what 's wrong with that area ?
kalen , look at me . there 's no one here but us . you see ... i 'm here , you 're here , alexander 's here . there are no morlocks . it was just a dream ...
i do n't get it .
due west , captain mendez . and may god be with us ...
are you really a bail bondsman ?
moonby what ?
wildman 's in town . he just became an american citizen . something big 's about to go down . i want to know where he goes and who he sees . i want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture ...
the man said just to use my imagination . let 's see ... yeah , i get it . potential . i can see it now . the first major urban theme park . village ghetto land . kinda like legoland , but made entirely from broken glass , hypodermic needles and crack vials . totally e-ticket .
what for ?
and what do you do about it ?
my lord , i 'm not sure that ...
oh , ya big lizard ! now we 'll never know what it is !
goodnight to you , susan .
what a terrible misunderstanding . of course , signora colombo can stay in the flat . who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal ... when they pay such low rent .
i want you to know that i do n't go about giving my pictures to just anyone .
whoops ... do n't mind me . go ahead and finish up .
i intend to . this phone is wired like no other : it 's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition , it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand . with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target 's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes ...
if i tell you , then it 's no fun .
that 's okay . i just have to use the bathroom and then i 'll leave .
you 're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in u.s. fucking a today . that 's got to be the least private thing i can think of .
do you feel good about it ?
yes .
'cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend ? who would take offense to that ?
we 've been digging . we 've been digging for hours . if there was anything here to find we would have found it .
robert , you leave it up these people ... !
i need your help --
well , i 'll see ya .

[ i want you . ]
my timing always was lousy .
snotty neurotic bitch ...
everybody got upset . they had a meeting . momma started crying . i do n't draw like that anymore .
but honey , i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen .
do you mean the speech you 're writing ?
yes we do . here ...
and who kills in the manner of his victim .
a harmless joke .
our life in a nutshell ...

no . but i 've been to brooklyn .
are you here illegally ? do n't worry about that . we 'll talk to immigration . they wo n't deport you .
johnny , people get hurt ... people get killed in the federal service . if something happened to you i do n't know what i would do ...

you are going after mayor bennett .
sure , danny , it will be lots of fun .

no matter how much distance we put between us and this house , i bring with it with me . and i 'll feel it every minute we 're together . and i 'll blame loving you for how much it hurts . and then even these four days wo n't be anything more than something sordid and ... a mistake .
i 'm a housewife .
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died . they also said their children were taken from them .
it does n't make sense . who would want to do that to you ?
all i did ...
... get outta my way , you sonofa < u > bitch < /u > ...
it 's my condition . i never know if i 've already eaten , so i always just eat small amounts .

well , the cream of society awaits . if you 're ever in the neighborhood ...
you came all the way from los angeles to tell me that ?
how grateful ?
the corleone family do n't have that kind of muscle anymore . the godfather is sick . you 're getting chased out of new york by barzini and the other families , and you think you can find easier pickings here . i 've talked to barzini ; i can make a deal with him and keep my hotel !
i got an idea what happened .
ed smythe , yes .

no . it 's okay .
it 's not a nelwyn baby .
i caught up with lednov in nogales . he did n't like the idea of comin ' back across the border but he came . i turned him over to the sheriff and -- that 's the story .
commissioner strickland .
when did you buy a gun ?
at least you 're honest . call me by my middle name -- eugene -- if you 're going to be jerome , you may as well start getting used to it .
hardware 's too sophisticated . it 's got ta be the government . and why do i think they 're looking for you ?
why the math ?
i got vincennes in the next room . it 's not a good week for cops in general .
my god , rose , what 's gotten into --
wearing white , just like on our ... wedding day . i remember it .
any particular brand ?
that sounds like you is in trouble already , homer .
he hit you ?
dwayne pinsley . from high school . that 's how i knew you were here . when you called , from the airport .
what the hell took so long .
at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company . small , but profitable . they asked if you would endorse their oil . we could get some very nice posters . make some very big money ...
the material you 've been creating is too white bread . white people with black faces . the huxtable 's , cosby , revolutionary . but that 's dead . we ca n't go down that road again .
well -- - okay . it 's a deal . one cold drink , if'n you please . in advance . one chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand ... that goes for the rest of you mullet-heads , too .

it 's her choice -- she 's human --
microscopic - - never repeat , and vastly affect the outcome . that 's what ?
that should put us ahead of the criminals .
your mind is just twisted enough . i believe you 'd do all this just to get a dip or two .
and do they believe it ?
so you took off your shirt ?
um ...

dammit ! huh huh . that chick wants me .
seth , he did it . you were by the beer cooler with your back turned . i was by the magazines , i could see his face . and i saw him mouth :

what about now , is there anything you can help me out with ?
william - he asked me to meet him here .
yeah ?
god , here we go .
he 's got piano lessons .

... but 'lias is still out there .
on a good run ... yeah .
`` dad says we gwan sleep on it .

would you like to meet him ?
valerie doran ? two floors up , one window over .
what happened ?
we 're getting that anyway .
henry .
i wish i were . i wish i had done it , then i could confess and you 'd be at peace . that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved , i wish you had an enemy , so i could beat him up .
we 'll do our best .
it probably would n't have any effect on him . the only sure way to stop jason is to return him to his original resting place , where he drowned in 1957 .
then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving , sergeant . what i said on the phone 's the same as i 'm saying now . i got no idea where amb- er is , or who it was took her there .
does it matter ?
i think i better go , stew .
it 's just a stupid cat .

oxygen gets you high . in a catastrophic emergency , we 're taking giant , panicked breaths ...
coffee , ed ?

you were probably so scared you did n't look to see what the trick was .
who needs vermouth ?
but -- why ?
get out !
i knew you 'd come , but my strength has left me .
what if i say no ?
what the hell 's going on ? !
michael , you do n't have to go down there .
a deal ?
only the best for my mother .
counselor ?
with you .
what ? what kind of episode ?
fuck off man . it 's just a fish .
not ... quite .
you can tell something about him or we would n't have found the finger print ...
but your life and lands are far from here .
sure i 'm sure . what is this ?
we got it to live for ten hours . that 's some kind of record .
do n't tell me you did n't know it was loaded . sylvie !
you 've been so good to me . you 're the brother i never had . i 'm the brother you never had .

twenty-five thousand for clothes .
i do n't know , look around .
you still gon na play for brazil ?
we 've ... just begun to . i suppose you 're seventy-five .
it 's all right , it wo n't bite you . under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed . this is the notice .
you talk as if i were asta .
big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that i do n't think is going to make it .
it must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool .
no . we < u > all < /u > go .
and two , to make a point : title does not dictate behavior .
a committee of the majority party leaders . they decide when a bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list --
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities ? the executioner of the king 's nephew , my husband 's own cousin ?
major arnold believes he has a moral duty , too .
... you fucked me !
have you checked the bars ? the guy 's irresponsible ; he 's done this before .
that you , sail , honey ?
are n't we a little old for that ?
let 's get out of here .
i generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there 's some left over .
-- i may not know much about a lot of things , sir -- but i know that willet creek country like a book -- and -- and i tell you , senator paine -- there 's something *wrong* about this dam -- why , there is n't a foot of water in that creek -- it 's dry four months out of the --
mr. ryan just borrowed my birthday cake . i do n't really know him .
this is my good john brown .
you 're not one of them . there 's been a mistake .
... it 's easy . you go down . you come up . ... right , johana ?
it 's not so bad these days . kids like joint custody . two sets of toys .
victor 's right . johnny , get to the command center . close the shields .
you lied to me .
... spring and summer ... yes , i see ... fall and winter . yes , indeed ... could you go through that one more time , please , mr. gardiner ?
< i > i 've got something , listen now , this one is real good , you 'll see . we 'll send a present to his door upon there 'll be a note to read. < /i >
hey , gi bill pays for school . and shit , if i stuck around here , instead of signing up , i 'd probably be in jail , or sitting on the stoop drinking bitter dog with rose , you know ?
do n't be dim .
wait -- cecil has a condo in tahoe . let 's go there !
you think that 's all we busted -- you should see ...
hello . hi . hi .

ma'am . your husband , bernie . you did n't , by any chance , lead him to the lake blindfolded ?
what is it ?
am i in there ?
it 's a surprise .
okay , group 's in session . straight talk only in this room .
did he ever get rough with you ?
oh , harry . what are we going to do ?
we 're here because we 're the best flyers in the wing . not because of some mig encounter .
i know that , charles .
it 's the white house .
i thought so , too . joe 's a neat guy .
hunting 's been pretty good on the farm the last few years . it 's one of the perks of the job . if you 're interested , tomorrow i could show you some of my favorite spots .
the wind drift is lateral .
if she wanted to set you up , you 'd be in custody right now . when you said you 'd name her as an accessory she believed you . that scares her more than anything .
come on , he did n't mean anything .
what about for food an ' stuff ?
yah - how are you doon ?
what kind of daughterly smackeroo was that ?
we figure the perpetrator let him out . he 's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over .
sobek . half man , half croc , oldest god --
my job , my rules .
i know where it is .
i just realized something . where 's cort ? i have n't seen him for hours .
fuck you ! have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life !
i always think everything could be a trap -- which is why i 'm still alive .
you tell me , then ... you walk into an apartment , and a man has beaten his wife to death , or the wife murdered the husband , and you have to wash the blood off their children . you put the killer in jail . who won ?
just her name .
well , you do n't have to lose your temper !
i 'm sure .
... look , they love you , kid ? everybody does . you see caven 's review in the herald ?
good .
do n't you have something you want to say to david ?
hindsight . it 's like foresight without a future .
yes , i thought that it would be best .
let me guess . this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside . that inside you , there is a little dyke just like me ?
i 'm not your boy . i do n't like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . let 's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
the grandfather clock ?
you 're attractive , you 're smart . stand on your own two feet , know what i mean ? and you got a wicked sense of humor . man , you really zinged the boss a couple times , it was all i could do --
dr. jones .
you better dust this place , sam .
you did n't have to kill sophie .
that 's great , now make a left , then straight !
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
you mind if i check things back here ?
of course she does and i must say i 'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital . i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill .
well , i do barbara rush .
well , you was shootin ' every which way an ' ...
did they ? you are only a man , different than most -- but still a man . you feel the same -- want the same . you want to live .
you should have told them he 'd disappeared .
species , keystones affect the entire ecosystem , that could explain all these worms , the water . you 've got a crocodile . bury your friend .
a true friend would do it .

look , charlie , you did n't do it , and you know you did n't .
oh , yes ! we 'll keep him in here , obviously . but if he had to leave and we were with him .
and i ai n't no nigger either !
i would have done the same thing .
if i were in their place and i 'd run out of time , i 'd abandon the ship before i grew to dangerous size ... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible , on my own ...
it must have been terrifying ?
maybe i can do something right .
albania , albania , albania , james bond villains .
i want you ... to bend over .
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects ?
that 's why you got scared when mrs. christian hired me . you knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . how 'd you find me ?
may i have it , please ?
um , yeah , thirty miles east .
segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months -- and never stayed anyplace over a night or two . switch to another station , huh ? you 're driving me crazy with that .
yeah , i was wondering why he should do that .
andy !
thank you .
they came at me from all sides , hundreds of 'em . we kept firing - zat-tat-tat-tat ! `` throw the grenades , '' i shouted . `` mac , throw the grenades ! '' `` he 's dead , '' joe said , and kept right on feeding me bullets . zat-tat-tat-tat ! they kept falling , but they kept coming . bullets whizzing all around me . zot ! joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head . i thought i was done for . but i kept firing . zat-tat-tat ! only one thought kept me going . kill ! kill ! for mac , and joe , and the rest of the guys . kill ! - a blinding flash . i wake up on a stretcher . `` did we hold ? '' i asked the medic . `` yes , sir , '' he said , and i slipped into unconsciousness .

he was a little older . looked like the marlboro man .
nick , what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid ?

it 's no problem
i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography , mr lombard . by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold . so as you see , i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account .
134 continued :
fine . you know , dr. thurman is n't so bad a lady . i can tell her anything .

i 'm real excited about working for you mr. matthews ...
thelma , if i die --
i saw him ! ! i saw kenny ! !
he 's a suitor !
she 'd come to me , sometimes in the middle of the night . bruises all over her back , her upper arms . i pled with her to let me call the police , but she would n't hear it . wanted to keep it a secret .
the powwow safe ! where is the powwow safe !
we 'll start small . when we got 'em lined up , we increase the supply a bit at a time . only sell the best stuff . and keep the price high , 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze .
i 'd forgotten that .
leak at the plant . they had to shut her down .
why you low-down , stuck-up , half- witted , scruffy-looking nerf-herder .
it 's insanity around here .
caught me trying to be fancy ! yeah , that 's it , bart .
is there something wrong with the phone ?
what do you think , dumbshit ?
i think nothing happens . you 're dead meat . that 's it .
tanks ... coming back . let 's go .
my rose . it 's kind of like a motto . people will say , there comes rose with her rose .
bugger the buffs .
i do n't think we were the first .
what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology ? i thought that was your project .
i dunno . landing pad for a helicopter ? i dunno .
good morning , comrade .
hell , you 'd probably be half way to new york by now ...
i knew you 'd come . i left that skylight open for you .
was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers , gypsy violins off stage ?
some do . i did n't .
sure , i guess .
who said i was getting rid of it ?
this is a nice place . it must have cost a pretty penny .
yeah , the lot 's right there . my truck is right out back .
i. sold the car .
you know , my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist ... living in a garret , poor but free !
yup .
yeah .
bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now .
who 's got a gun ?
you got any broken bones ?
i do care about you !
what 're those ?
you got it !
what pattern was that ?
that 's kenneth , my brother . he 's talking on the phone .
i have to put my family 's welfare on the line here , my friend ! and what are you puttin ' up ? you 're puttin ' up words !
i do n't find this `` turning the tables '' thing very interesting --
so -- what do we do now ?
it 's too late for that .
that 's the last stuff you 'll ever get from me .
isolinear tags . their transporters can lock onto them .
[ you stole the drop . ]
what , is that supposed to `` hypnotize '' me ?
yeah , what ?
okay , norman , listen , i really want to talk about this at home . i think it 's a matter for your analyst ... and mine .
oh , you know exactly what i mean , honey ? it 'd make the future so simple and nice .
shut up , man , just shut the hell up ! i got ta think ! i got ta think ! !
no , he was n't . he just lowered himself into a bar stool and said ... 'oo i do feel bad . i 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees ! '
oh my god ... it 's johnnie ... duck down ! ... get goin ' !
maybe we should n't fight at all . fighting is pretty immature .
& quot ; yo soy un hombre sincero ... & quot ; i am a sincere man , from the land of the palms ...
on a scale of one to ten : two . but -- -- she 'll take care of you , myers . she 's a tough one .
so you are going to talk me to death .
he 's got my daddy 's watch , claude . i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock . and that was you , mr. pike .
yeah .
something 's wrong .
keep pushing .
i should get a garter belt .
you 're kidding .
but they both worked at the white house ?
you 're not having lunch ?
so at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower , your father was shot ?
we 've known each other too long , orson . sling the bullshit elsewhere .
deal 's changed .
he deserved it .
two more star destroyers heading right at us .
you could n't handle shit . you just better come through with some kind of payment on tuesday ... anything . understand ? hold onto your pay- check this week .
you were commissioned one month earlier , which makes you the senior officer . remember . there are no bad crews -- only bad leaders .
it 's a hoax . i knew it !
i had to be a damn hemingway hero . well i 'll tell ya , the old man and the sea did n't go through half this shit .
sterling silver . it was my dear mother-in-law 's , part of a dinner set of fifty pieces . it 's one of the few things that survived . oh , but i do rattle on so . tell me about yourself , harold . what do you do when you are n't visiting funerals ?
what was that ?
golly , ma -- consarn that music ! should n't a-had the harvest festival tonight .
eight dollars ? ! franklin mint or not , it 's damaged goods !
you 've been very kind about it , mr. hunsecker . hunsecker give susie credit for that . i took her word that there was nothing to the smear . matter of fact , i 'll have my say about smears on the show today . that 's why i 'd like your personal assurance , too .
what are you talking about ?
oh , thomas . ma , it 's just a big dance hall , and that 's all it is . i been there a hundred times . loaded with tomatoes . boy , you 're funny , ma .
personally ?

well , fust off ...
what ?
you can do it .
objection , asking the witness to speculate .
he called me up . he wanted to talk to me about my ideas .
that 's what your crew said . are they lying ? or are you ?
i have to have a life . i have to do things that i want with people my own age . it 's none of your business who i am going out with . i do n't give a good goddam if you 're angry --
i do n't know either . i think i 'm a very nice guy . i also think i 'm a pretty smart guy in my own way .
i think i 've studied enough .
what 's happenin ' .
um-hmm . come with me , brother . i want to show you something .
turn on the translation circuit .
yeah .
now i 'll ask you another . you think i got no contacts out here ? that nag paid off at just the opening price . there was n't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted . there ai n't enough action to tickle the tote , but you claim a ten grand win ! you send me ten thousand dollars , like i 'm some mark you can blow off !
i certainly hope not .
we can live with that .
look , todd , you 're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set .
waddaya mean , ralph ?
tell me something . does this usually happen to you , mr. gittes ?
how come ?
you look okay to me , harry . come over here and sit down . tell me what you been up to .

well . i 'd let you come in , but the place is a mess ...
why yes , do you know it ?
one room , one night .
oh , i doubt that 's the case .
seventy-five percent ? that 's not nearly good enough for me . i 'm extremely skeptical .
let 's go look at the sand pit behind your house .
well , then ...
come on , cheer up . it could be worse .
the phone . what did you hear on the phone . tell me . word for word .
they 're gon na love you , chief .

no bits of bone , no particles of scalp , no strands of hair ?
dorothy !

hi .
yeah , i think so . what happened ?
fortunate that i was here to keep susan entertained .

they do n't know they 're dead ?
but everything that 's happening is good ! you can be a part of it !

i like enthusiasm . that 's why i use a lot of smart-ass kids . not just 'cause they work cheap .
well , i want you to go to bed directly after dinner . you know how susceptible you are to colds . harold has always been a delicate child . even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - harold , dear , eat up your beets ...

but , this is project mayhem .
english weather . you know , after all we 've been through , i should say we deserve a long holiday ...
michael , you 're sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family .
whoo-hoo-hoo ! whoo-hoo-hoo !
jesus , how could you be so stupid ? come on , we 're going to a hospital .

kissing ? is that what you think happens ? kissing is n't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .

darling ? i hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night . now you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy .
look , i got ta get some sleep .
thanks .
your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born . i was drunk and i was foolish enough to answer her .

at-at-at-at-at .
you want to see him too , right ?
you betcha !
could we have a word ?
i read your report . i had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase , tom being nowhere around --
no . actually i think it 's fucking crazy , i do n't know if i could do it .
are you kidding ? harry had to go out of town .
how 'd it go ?
you 'd be surprised what all you can get , you ask for it the right way .
where are you going ?
you said --
yes . dead . two nights ago . the night of my dream .
i was here ... as a kid . i think you were here , too . but you ... looked just like you look now .
what were you talking about ?
please do n't be angry ... believe me , it 's got nothing to do with you .
no . go back to the woods . this is a sacrifice i need to make . in my world we have something called penance . it 's another abstraction , but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent . it does n't exist for you , and it should n't . see , i could never be free again anyway , so i might as well be in jail .
there 's nothing in them .
what ? what did you tell me ?
life is true .
i do n't like touching fish , how do you pull the hook out without touching it ?
they 've tricked us .
they 're not even gon na be your enemie-a if you do n't give that to me really soon .
why is she eight pounds over ?
where to ?
excellent . dc mitchell is a rising star , mr. stevens . under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade .
one simple word , three little letters . yes . that 's all it 's gon na take and we could move out of this dump , get the real deal . big houses , legit business ...
wood or wire ? they have both .
you 're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
because `` dr. grant '' is n't looking for eric . dr. grant is looking for the coast .
because you 're probably the last person i 'll ever talk to .
i 've located the suspect zero file . did you know there was one ? koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation .
what 's so funny ?
is n't that rather too close ... ?
we should go burn that school to the ground , sir !
michael , it 's not true . please tell me .
i know your face . are you an actor ?
you 're forgetting who 's in charge --
i hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . i used to run a lot of dope for him . fuckin ' shame he got shivved .
i came over to see you . i brought something ... i wanted to show you .
what ?
so , what are you doing tonight ?
when the two of you held each other . when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine . when your parents were out and the two of you were alone ... completely alone in that big house .
tonight , we 're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra ...
i got two kids going to school there , and if i changed them from one town to another , they 'd lose a grade .
sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them . just sometimes .
what was that all about ? you think he 's trying to scare us ?
i 've got some good news . the doctor says you 're all better . you can come home .

i 'll talk to him .
`` rosebud ? i 'll tell you about rosebud
shut up !
i see . forgive my cultural ignorance .
so far it 's all dead ends . no credit history . no employment history . his bank account 's only five years old and it started as cash . we 're even trying to trace his furniture , but for now all we know is he 's independently wealth , well educated and totally insane . we may never know how he got that way .
no .
wait a minute . do i get from you that she wants to pay me alimony ?
bella romari if i were not seated , i would embrace you in three movements like a sonata . ah , my wonderful one . fly with me tonight . we will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies .
madmartigan , you promised me you 'd take care of elora danan like your own daughter . she is all that matters . are you going to abandon her ?
no ?
i do n't know . just ... whispering .
-- oh , for chrissake , that 's a given ; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
all it says is that it 's above the vulva ... but where the hell is the vulva ?
say , baxter -- you gave me the wrong key .
your pop said to put these on his tab . sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .
the four noble truths , as taught by the lord sakyamuni buddha are : the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering , the truth of the cessation of suffering , the truth of the way which leads to the cessation of suffering .
they use the bogan force .
he 's dead .
grady ?

neski was a roadblock . without me , there 's no company , no fortune . you owe me , uri . one last push .
nonsense ! we 'll find a great doctor , he 'll cure you . they can cure anything these days .
still torturing yourself over that enid , huh ?
do you know where that term comes from ? in the early 1900 's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb .
mister , if you do n't shut up , i 'm gon na kick 100 % of your ass .
all right , we ca n't blow the fuck out of them ... why not roll some canisters of cn-20 down there . nerve gas the whole nest ?
you better be careful . i heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today . hey , what class do we have next ?
you know her ?
i 've got goose-bumps all over me .
i 'll be there for you .
is n't this a fabulous picture ?
i know . you 're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs .
i do n't know about this , man --
hey , where does it say that ?
oh my god . are you serious ?
how 're you doing ? looking lovely as always .
that must be rather nice , in a way . i mean , you do n't have any --
look ! this is a good one !
what ?
do n't leave me .
you thinking about that girl that dumped you ?
we 're a tiny version of all that ?
can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here ?
not in my experience .
wonder where we 'll be then .
no .
message acknowledged . all units will be informed .
did n't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth ?
they 're not very imaginative ?
people still watch that ?
you have to do what i say ? !
des moines .
i 'll come inside with you , if you like , but mr. crawford said you 'd probably want to be alone .
lord , never thought i 'd live to see my boy in prison .
she needs a little time .
fred !
the successes obtained are the results of those methods . one presupposes the other and vice versa .
oh boy !
grab the coffee , will ya ? i told zed i 'd give him a buzz .
all i have is my personal feelings . i was n't raised with the ideals of the federation . but i 'm trying to understand them now . to live up to them . to live up to you .
i do n't know . just help me . give me a cigarette .
i do n't know . but it was weird in terms of what happened next . sean was still watching his mother .
i 've got some news . your daughter 's all right . at least i think she is .
how long ?
you are going where ?
i think i already have .
how did you get me out of there ?
now , let me get this straight . this affair that you 're not having , is it not with a man or not with a woman ?
an austrian ... not much to go on , is it ?
no , i meant you did n't have to tackle me and rip my dress . a polite push , perhaps ? a clear shout of `` watch out , anna '' would have done nicely ...
what the hell happened !
mr. chance , assuming what you say is the truth , i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased 's estate .
yeah .
you already know what they are .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . lord wessex was looking at you tonight .
but i do n't understand .
that reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery ?
so far i 've been told i can cooperate and get probation , maybe . or , i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ?
remember the first round how i had him against the ropes , and ?
the marines .
yup .
what did it look like ?
you and mel gordon ?
yeah --
i hate fuckin ' opera .

i think they 're from 'you know ' . some place that has similar conditions ... cold , intense pressure . no light .
cecile , everybody does it . it 's just that nobody talks about it .
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
what ? i just could n't just let them sleep in the street .
coz he thinks you 're a witness .
did the priest say anything about the resurrection ? or was it all about judgment ?
mr. caiman , you 're married .
nah . i have n't dribbled a ball in four and a half months . maybe i miss some of the attention , but besides that ...
his madness ... .could be from shock .
and all 's fair in love and war ?
no . i told you i was going to talk to shaw .
you think i 'm after money ? i told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
victor , explain yourself .
oh yeah ? guess again .
my hero . let 's go .
tapert . so , now i 've got tapert , butterfield .

-- you do ? -- with access to records ?
told you what ?
you ca n't do that yourself ?
i do n't have any proof , palmer .
no , no . i 'm not powerless . because ... because i understand the system . i believe i can control it . maybe not control it totally . but ... tame it enough to make it do some good .
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months . it seems impossible , but in light of the transmission ... i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now .
we do n't think it 's fair to keep you here , where your future is limited . but we wish you luck , andy , all the luck in the world .
no ... i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you .

you went out the window . she was beaten and raped . she died in the hospital .
yeah , let 's just get outta here .
wherever you go on the planet , i 'll find you . there 's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
who says she does anything for me ? she 's my friend . when my friends get into trouble , i like to help 'em out .

bookkeepers know everything . rocco 's men are all a little too good for the jobs they 're supposed to be doing . they get a little more money than the job 's worth . lampone 's a good man ; he 's operating perfectly .
she took our wedding photos , for chrissakes . you do n't trust anyone .

'dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals . '

what 's you name ?
you sure he 's going to come ?
... 'cause of being woken up , and it would make my job impossible . so then i would n't even try .
no , just a friend of mine . i do n't think he likes jell桹 .
so ... i see you 're still in the neighborhood .
how are we gon na get him out of there ?
no . entrapment is what cops do to robbers .
you 're too kind .
i kinda thought i might make a good one . i 'm very observant .
aha ! he has a brilliant military record , i 'm sure .

hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .
< i > i once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone , anything. < /i >
oh !
and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair , captain james tiberius kirk . i put it to you , captain , that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son .
you better come help me .
what does that mean ?
that 's right . more than four thousand pictures of the same place . the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning . four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather . that 's why i can never take a vacation . i 've got to be in my spot every morning . every morning in the same spot at the same time .

you 'll be safe here . i wo n't be long . help yourself to anything you want . the galley 's through there . you can make coffee if you like .
you 're sure easy to talk to . i wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking , say you were in a bar and i came up to you -- i wonder what would happen .
he was n't crazy . in the beginning i was upset . i think i really hated him . but then , with time , i understood what he said ... and your silence too .
i looked in his car . he 's got pictures of you , clippings , maps .
it 's lynn .
sure , why not ?
and you ?
yeah .
because i like you so much . you have coffee here every morning , do n't you ? if i came by , could you give me the name of a doctor ?

a match made in heaven .
i do n't know . i 'd like to know where he is .
take the men . i can finish alone .
no . thanks . absolutely .
why do you fret about something that is n't there ?
how 's the detective business ?
a misunderstood bachelor .

my client ca n't walk , your honor .

do n't you think i know it ?
i called . you were n't there .
what a relief !
what 's happened ? ... why did it leave ?
he 's wrong , you know -- about kennedy , lbj , truman .
if his love were like mine , he would not permit you to come here .
you 're going to put your theories to practice . i 'm sending you into the field .
what shall we do ?
why ?
you know , maybe you should get some rest --
how is your cold ?
he 's a likable chap -- he 's got an honest face --
< u > this is an operations desk < /u > .
where 's lieutenant barcalow ?
it 's right on hawthorne boulevard and manhattan beach boulevard . it 's red brick ...

i 'm staying with a friend .
what ?
i said , < u > i 'll take you there < /u > . nobody 's going near star without me .
no , i do n't think so . leave me alone , give me money . that 's what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .
i must have fallen asleep . i was asleep when you got home , was n't i ?
nobody seems to know .
shit ! you bought enough pate for a fucking army !
she must be very attractive . would she like an autograph ? she might remember me ... where 's trini ?
i ... i did n't think you would have any interest in this get together ... i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you -- it 's not like a real party or anything .
calm down ? we 're going away for life and you tell me to calm down ?
come take a look . an entire-suite of main-frame computer .
i knew you would n't come if i did n't have a map .
yeah ... he was one martin helder . white male , twenty-seven . let 's see ... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction , a couple for sale of a controlled substance . oh yeah , and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock .
motherfuck a window , radio raheem is dead .
no way .
here you go sweetheart , throw it my way .
i thought half of it was your brother 's ?
that 'd be fine , bobby .

it 's only two hours away .
coordinate our attack with the valdore 's tactical officer . triangulate fire on any shield impacts .
that 's true -- but the emotion is still there . they just learn to control it .
we ca n't just go off and --
he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire . he wants everybody there . he 'll talk to you . if after talkin ' to you he 's convinced you 're ok , he 'll do business . if not , he 'll say fuck it and walk out the door . he also wants a sample bag .
you know how , like they say , you save someone 's life , you responsible for them . guess he just do n't think it 's safe for me .
okay . then be good enough to hand us our money back , or you think about us coming in on this new one .
but like only up to the part about the raft , because i did n't read any farther .
i 'm sorry about steve , not myself . i 'm even sorry for my brother . to be so lonely , without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she 's his only real family -
yes ?
okay then . have you got a lot of friends ?
and why did n't marrow tell < u > us < /u > ? does n't he trust women ? that fuck .
yeah . we call him doc sometimes , you know , like in the bugs bunny cartoons . but how did you know that ?
i 'm sixteen years old . i 'm underage . how could i possibly threaten you ?
ah , yes ... the code . it 's a riddle , actually . some fancy of 3jane 's . unfortunately , you 'll have to find out for yourself . i can no more know that code than i can shut down my own hard wired defences . now , our time is running short ... and you have n't even touched your drink .
slowly or quickly ?
either of you seen dodge ?
who are you ?
you 'd say anything to keep me away from her . to keep her for yourself .
if there is one thing i admire , it 's a girl with a shapely ankle .
of course . is n't it wonderful ? the bandages came of this afternoon . come and join the fun . everybody 's here .

that was two years ago . john was still in love with me . he would n't leave me alone .
that 's right . and the good thing is you can do it anywhere .
what the hell is it , anyhow ?
they 're spooks .
i can hear you again , clearly .
she was here first .
no , sir !
you wo n't have to . i 'll explain what a palate is .
i will run .

next to `` boring , '' `` sucks '' is the most painfully overused word in the current english language . i thought if i could reverse the meaning of `` sucks '' so it means something positive , i do n't know ... it would be vaguely revolutionary . it 's kind of my social experiment for the summer . `` suck '' is historically a nice word -- sno-cones , your mother 's ...
what 's the matter ?
all you have to do is ask . the quarterback is saying they 'll run the old statue of liberty . their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end .
i aim to .

honey . nothing 's impossible . you just do n't shoot someone like that for no reason . maybe he was askin ' for it . anyway , somebody 's husband probably got ol ' harlan .
reliquary --
it 's just an idea . i want your opinion . i mean , we go halfway on everything , right ?
do you have any idea who she is ?
my relationship with god is my own .

this behavior will stop at once .
toby oxman .

hey , jake ... when am i gon na get to play the inside ?
well , what 's the point of waiting ?
yayo . where is he ?
you want to go ?
he murdered eladio cruz . that tough enough for you ?
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here .
i give up .
how should i know ?
i suppose if you 're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty , medium height , medium weight , medium build . probably not too many men fit that bill .
what about her .
... tell them ...
by who ?
-- will he keep his word ?

powell ? what 's going on ?
i think what you did ...
never heard of it .
good . you wan na tell me what happened ?
ten flights ?
< u > i 'm < /u > dressed .
they do n't know .

is that funny ?
how 'bout the morgue ?
thanks a lot , mom .
i was going to buy a slice .
listen , man . i got rolled half and hour ago for everything i had .
so why did you leave ?
what 's on your mind ? do n't --

sir ... ?
i must really be slacking off . hungry ?

a perry russo ?
no sense at all . i 'm a little stressed .
listen , elaine -- it seems to me that there is n't a bar in here . i mean -- as far as i know .
you must understand , this is all new to me ...

you will help me with my other problem .
i 've seen them all before .
i made you some cocoa . see ?

thanks . did you know you should n't light three cigarettes with a match ?
how you feelin ' , doc ?
where is it ?
why , i 'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute .
you said it popped out too easily . nothing 's ever good enough for you , is it ?
hey , man , if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu , i 'd tell her to go fuck herself . why ca n't she board it ?
no you do n't know who stole it . just let me do the thinking .
it 's always been like this .
i do n't really agree with you , dave . my on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements .
what ?
now what ?
all right ... sorry ... i feel indebted to him .
tip top , willie ... tip top .
what happened to her ?
you mean soap ?
mmmm ... you smell good .

that 's good . that 's right ! they died around a dried-up puddle ! without fighting each other . this is looking good .
... and that you invited him to strike you ? to fight it out on the deck of your ship ? !
what was it ? what the fuck was it ?
this is the newest technology approved for general implementation . it 's called a locater implant . every parolee gets one . we 're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life .
well , you should . because i appreciate you , too , you know .
oh , do you do much fishing ?
with a family ?
this is horseshit .
maybe that 's who your father is , cartman !
i 'm assuming we 're exploring that possibility .
what d'you mean ?
i see your point , bedsoe , but i have to look at this from the law 's point of view . there 's something missing here . it 's something i 'm sure you 've come across many times in your career . it 's called evidence . get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it . find me an eye witness . dig up a motive . until then we do n't have a case against him .
what do you think ?
salvy , would i steer you wrong ? let 's say that 's the truck ; it 's full of cigarettes , right ? now , two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there , take the cigarettes out , sell 'em , make some cash .

i like pigeons . you send a bird five hundred miles away he wo n't stop for food or water until he 's back in his own coop .
gentlemen , there 's no sickness smell at all here , and little blood . when we leave , close the gate securely , do n't open it til morning and keep your fires high . any questions , ask them now . you two will sleep beautifully in your tents . and stay there .

big v jack vincennes ! may i have this dance ?
dad ?

hey lovey , come here ! lovey , i asked for a glass of wine and look what i got . come on , sit down .
were they trying to kill you ? *
maybe she do n't know . although i do n't see how that could be . maybe she did n't want to upset you -
it 's about this .
oh i was walkin ' down lime street one day ...
i do n't remember seeing any ponds up there .
we said 48 hours .
it 's hard for me to imagine a better place . where i come from there 's so much ... frenzy . day and night . it seems we 're all running faster and faster ... ... all in identical bowler hats .
from what i 've seen , mr. galvin , you have a very good case ...
you sonuvabitch .
no can do . life goes on , pointfive ... you left me , remember ?
nothing .
she intends to change the future somehow .
funny you should say that . my grandfather was a peach farmer .
... it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter .
i know that 's what it looks like , but it 's not . i ca n't logically explain to you why it 's not . morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed . i understand that now . that 's why i have to go .
you , zack ?
hi , it 's really great to meet you guys . i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed , but i knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
do you have to say that ?
we should be . everybody wants what we have .
that is so true . you 're different , chauncey ... quite different than most men .
not to me . never to me .
so what do you say ? can we be friends ?
you 're new to charenton , yes ? perhaps you 're not yet familiar with my husband , and his unusual case .
but i love you . and i want the whole world to know it .
do n't you want a second take , for protection ?
that 's where we were this morning . he had it marked . right on the border of tibet . here 's where civilization ends . we must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map .
thank you . have you been getting the money i sent you ?
oh really ? well , i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june .
got compliments coming outta your ass , do n't ya ?
yeah ...
i always like to see the funny side of things . no sense crying when you do n't have to . and you 're so funny . looking at you , i forget all about my toothache .
then why did you marry her -
you go .
he 's shy , not like enzo .
can i help you ?
jesus ...
vicky ... last night ... i was n't lying .

the chocolate coating makes it go down easier . but you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency . and you should n't go swimming after , for at least , what ?
you 're mad at me . great . you have every right to be . but we 're both mad at dark town . we 're both mad at hypnos .

shut up , before you lose them all !
one thing i could never stand is to see a filthy , dirty old drunkie , howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp , blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts . i could never stand to see anyone like that , whatever his age might be , but more especially when he was real old like this one was . the boys stop and applaud him .
i understand . thanks for letting me crash here .

no , i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i 've been shown .
do you know this young man , mrs. halligan ?

oh . then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the cdc scientists in atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish , doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective . you knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for .
what if you箁e wrong ? ?
yeah , well the only woman of the indian 's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend . i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet ... they both looked mad enough to kill him ...
i did not want to upset you . it was tragic . i did everything i could for him . i ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety , far from the fighting . but he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger .
just go to the beginning !
you promised me a drink ... .
yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it ? mint sauce or cranberries ?

well , you can live here as long as you want . do you have any plans ?
i used to tell myself that . used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain . but why kid yourself ? some things have to be endured . take it from me . and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ...
goodnight , you idiot .

the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted .
i do n't even know if it is my book . the bedouin found it in the plane , in the wreckage . it 's mine now . i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain . i 'm dying for rain - of course i 'm dying anyway - but i long to feel rain on my face .
i wanted to see if he was okay --
we 're very close ! because of you !
dave , you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it . now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail , go right ahead . but i am telling you , you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs .

and they made the first move ?
how could i miss it ? the tv wo n't quit with that stuff .
you ever miss it ?

the damn thing is going to have our asses ... .
are you sure you 're not tired ?
what about her teeth ? what about her fangs ?

you have the right to speak to an att --
are you the son of vito corleone ?
hello , express . what 's the idea , trying to outsmart the police ?
let 's go outside and talk . we need to do that .
suppose mrs. thorwald 's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag . during that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band .
we 're going to need at least two full rem cycles to get a clear neurological profile . three hours minimum , six hours ideal .
yeah . well if you did n't put it in the papers -- nobody 'd even know about it .

yes ... no , it is not unreasonable . although i --
if you promise not to snap my head off , i 'd like to thank you .
even if all this were true . there 're 20 other buildings . all of them filled with computers and --
dmitri ... you must understand that once you take her to tatiana ... well , it 's over ... nothing can happen between you . she 's a princess and you 're a commoner .
i got your message . way to go !
we 'll hop a plane tonight . an island ceremony . an abba dabba honeymoon !
there were no children . rene died , and < u > then < /u > hugh crain built all of this , and then he died . his heart was broken .
it 's not to wear around , or any- thing , i 'm < u > way < /u > too young . it 's just for play .
he 'll live .
no , she just left . i 'm surprised you did n't run into her . she went over to mr. norton 's house .
you could have infected him , is n't that right ?
well , do n't take too long , the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix ... i know , i know i forgot to mention that halloween falls on a school night , so they 're trick or treating tonight ... i got the joint decked out this year , built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid .
enough .
there may be two ... no , three who could fit it .
she better .
i do n't need a cause , just a lawyer .
seems like i 'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other , does n't it ?
oh . maybe r.j. got into a crash and killed everbody ?
yeah . on my way home now .
i mean , it 's your life .
i 'm no cat . i 'm just an assistant . a < u > secretary < /u > --
a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?

now why does she have to be naked ? how does that serve the plot ?
excuse me , mr. crandall -- i 've got to change this kid . it 's nice to meet you .
no , after you .
see that it is . take me over , please .
now just a minute , sir ! you 're way out of line !
this guy was a bad monkey . he dabbled in all the black arts , and listen to this prophecy . just before his head died , his last words were , `` death is but a door , time is but a window . i 'll be back . ''
that 's too bad . get some money , a nice looking girl on your arm , and everyone wants to take a piece . some kid i would n't let wash my mercedes is in my house , shooting at me . damn , i thought i could make it onto the balcony like tiger . he 's fat , that 's why , falls faster . i 'm trying to watch my weight , and look what happens . am i shot , frank ?
maybe i oughta eat your corn bread .
well , then , how about a cup of coffee , darlene ?
if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel . i will kill both him and the man who told me .
too late ... too late ... there 's no bringing her back .
do n't talk .
you know , val went to that college , too . for a whole year . could n't quite sit still for it , though . had too much vinegar in his system . but once he settles down , forgets this cowboy stuff , he 'll be one in a million .
it was a test .
i do n't scare that easily .
bogey at three o'clock high ! nose on !

you 're not doing shit . you 're so scared you ca n't even think .

i am king , and this is excalibur , sword of kings from the dawn of time . who are you , and why do you block the way ?
captain , can i put in for a transfer ?
that bitch . i worked so hard . we worked so hard , you and i. he would 've made us famous .
hm . well . they 'd have killed you if you were n't me , rudy . we knew you 'd start convincing 'em soon enough .
so what are you doing tonight , jack ?
let 's do it .
more endearments .
you ca n't judge him by modern standards . he 's very much a product of his times . in my day he could have any woman he wanted .
you should be happy , holmes . i 'm giving you and vanessa the gift of life . sweet , screaming , pooping life ! and you do n't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in ...
listen to me , listen to me , listen to me . listen , you fuckin ' cunt .
doctor gynde , my whole family 's sick . what 's going on ?
his mixture got screwed up . he panicked and pranged his regulator .
good night ?
it 's a long shot , but ... billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it .
uh , i think there 's been a mistake . i did n't save that woman .
but father , i 'm assistant editor .
... hello .
well , normie - you wo n't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time . how are the hands ... ?
come on , john , do n't be an asshole . i do n't like heights .
you gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return , monsieur f閘ix -- are they for sale now ?
do n't talk . keep at it . jab , jab , jab . you 're ahead on points .
i don抰 do naked . my sister ? she does naked .
thank you billy , from the baby and me .
no , i do n't .
he 's my brother .
what about the club ... ?
you 're inhuman .
you mean the guy from the old wine commercials ?
please .
what if we could find bi-frost the rainbow bridge ?
do n't count on it . we better take him out .
do you believe in that stuff ? reincarnation ?
i 'll give you my buick le sabre .
okay ?
i ca n't get through . i do n't know what 's wrong .
no , not okay . i thought we had a good thing going here . it shows you never know .
do you think he set me up ? do you think that was his intention ?
hi .
i 'll admit it 's a weakness . i do n't think he enjoys it . all right , he does enjoy it , so what ? what do you expect me to do about it ?
sure do n't . mind if i ask where you got it ?
oh , this ? 桰 like privacy when i retire . i 'm very delicate in that respect . prying eyes annoy me . behold the walls of jericho ! [ 4 ] maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet , but a lot safer . you see , i have no trumpet . now just to show you my heart 's in the right place , i 'll give you my best pair of pajamas .
okay . see ya .
there was n't a fire . there 'll be nothing for you to do .
caesar , what are we going to do ?
acknowledged ... ... i 'll talk to data .
carlo !
what 's that ?
the motherfucker killed vic .
< u > nuts < /u > to you too !
oh , that 's nothing . now take number three , for instance . that 's a pip . it 's the pathetic one . when you 're broke梐nd hungry梐nd everything looks black . it 's a long movement like this ? 梬ith a follow through .
it never happened . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 117 .
they found him dead in his own cab down by the port authority .
shut your ass up and grab the wall !
how is central these days ?
what other reason could you have come ? a captain . ranger . paratrooper . graduate of the recondo school . am i right about these things ?
`` what we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity ... and take it . and that 's it . '' and we sit there . i got the pen out ...
you know we 're right .
of being found out . of not being a genius
oh - you 're an actress .
i guess so . i never thought of it that way .
halina ?
yeah . it 's not just the chip , it has a pci bus . but you knew that .
it 's the cops . shit !
i see .
i dunno , but i do n't think we need him . dump him at the lights .
your birth stone . i thought --
yeah .
no .
alison jones .
or somebody stopped them .
it 's the only way it makes sense .
well , then , what 's he doing here ?
the shutdown must have turned off all the fences . goddamn it ! even nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence .
well , then , i -- i *thank* you , miss saunders ! nothing better could have happened -- . yes *sir* , miss saunders , we 're going right ahead with it !
you take one more step , i 'll kill her .
it 'll go in .
-- hey ! --
yes ... you understand that , do n't you , mathesar ? ...
what do you think 's going to happen to us ?
just until we find another girl .
yeah , it 's really your fault that we 're stuck in this shithole in the first place .
sure , go to the store . go there , describe to the man where you will be fishing , and for what , and the weather conditions , sun , no sun , whatnot , and so forth , and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish , ed ...
man , you are one scary-looking motherfucker !
i guess i have a weakness for him . it 's those big brown bambi eyes .
you 're not death . you 're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants .
there was something . it happened up your way .
well , it certainly is a coincidence . here of all places ! how is mrs. lewis ?
things a man is n't supposed to know .
he 's . . . beautiful . perfect .
no .
it 's amy kramer .
you 're not using the same guy who tried to fix it ?
no really , if god takes us away from each other , you know where to look now ?
he must not realize he is . like the navy crewman -- harry was sleeping then . he must 've manifested his dream .
right .
i do n't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the chinese take- away menus .
thinking about thorwald ?
funky little house , ai n't it ? friends , your hostess is now going to retire for what 's left of the night . if you need me , i 'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need : the door 'll be locked , i 'll be trying to sleep , and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole , i 'm gon na empty this thing into their fucking head . thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have .
oh ... .

you would n't tell that 棗
you 're doing fine , are n't you ? i mean ... the two of you alone in that house , so far out in the moor .
certain ?
like family , huh ?
that took some fun out of --
i do n't know what you 're talking about ?
they think you 're in fairbanks . if not , they still wo n't find you before the plane comes tomorrow .
that is correct .
you 're looking worried again , helena ?
tch . what are you --
the garage is plumbed . i 'll put in a toilet . we 'll survive .
- opening of the opera -
you 're taking advantage of a minor .
he said - be careful .
so why would he want to see you .
before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol don , uh , we better be sure we can prove them charges .
is she running a temperature ? what is it ?
do n't call again . it 's not safe . i 'll be in touch .
where she lives . in the guest house . now will you tell me what this is about ?
the monroe ?
what is happening with the world ? there was a time no civilian would touch a made man . now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something . what did they take ?
what do you know about michael ?
and who 's gon na pay for that ?
no dog .
do n't make this like a counsel , lloyd . i got statistics i can show you , i got graphs i can show you . that 's all the stuff i can show you , it all says the same thing . you have to decide on a career .
how long ago .
you know how many demerits we 're talking ?
this is all very pleasant but why are here ?
personally i 'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed .
i resent god 's monopoly .
that 's right . i 'm not like you . i 'm not gon na sit on my ass wondering what 's right and what 's wrong ... there 's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i 'm gon na get him . because it 's my job . and if you do n't get that ...
call me .
well what am i gon na do with it ?
-- without the means for higher education , so mr. lebowski has committed to sending all of them to college .
henry told cyrus he 'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again . when henry makes a threat like that , people tend to take him seriously .
maybe you have n't any sense of humor . well , i 'll give you one more chance ! now listen !
ebby 's told me a lot about you .
will you hang on just a second .
they need to get the introduction on camera . just play along , alright ?
did you break up with charlie ?
why do we always stay here ?
the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities . many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home .
we think we got a rat in the house .
remember me , from the pool ?
you see for me it 's over . over baby . i 'm gon na turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect .
ripped nylons work . makes the shot more real .
awful ?
i 've got the numbers .
he 's a rescue technician . peters , medical technician . dj ...
why do n't you go check it out ?
... if it happens , it happens . if it does n't , it does n't . do you understand what i 'm saying ? you never know what 's going to happen next , and the moment you think you know , that 's the moment you do n't know a goddamn thing . that 's what we call a paradox . are you following me ?
in english , please .
he 's still a doctor .
i would n't believe it ?
yes . that 's true . actually , at this point , i just want a job . wait . what do you mean ... yet ?
think we should call the local p.d . out there first ?
how long you going away for ?
i think you were jealous
why do you have to be with your opposite , why cant similar people be together ?
well , this must be about something !
bullshit . smurfette fucks all the other smurfs . that 's why papa smurf made her , 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny .
and replace them with new ones .
so what are you guys doing this summer ?
typing and clicking myself to renderings is n't why i started building models .
well done , mr. spock .

romeo ! at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee ?
banished ... yeah .
gertrude !
patrick do n't call me pumpkin anymore , okay ? i have to go .
i guess .
i was . an experiment . just to see if i could do it .
you do n't say . that 's a tough racket . my hat 's off to anyone who can make a go of it . damned interesting work , i 'd imagine .
july .
i do n't care what the damn pioneers ate . you just keep that shit away from me , now i mean it .
go , mr. sulu .
it 's going to cost .
yeah , but i enlarged this one . thought you might be interested .
what ? !
because they get outstanding settlements . and mother is determined that this time there 's no turning back .
captain , we have been seized by a tractor beam ... !
please do n't tell anyone . this could ruin my career .
every ship but the four you sent .
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught .
what ? oh , the flat tire ? yeah , i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there .
some unfinished business .
i think i hear it !
say , fella , i understand . i can -- what do the kids say these days -- `` dig where you 're comin ' from . '' you want to be rich , right ?
i guess most people are .
no , wait . it -- it was here before the openin ' number ... wait . what am i sayin ' ? i should just ask you , becky . where is it ?
no you do n't . you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet . you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem . you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he 's burning to talk to you and he ca n't wait another minute to find out what you 'll say . am i right ?
was n't my idea .
no spare .
you do n't mind that i 'm not coming tonight ?
you 're very macabre .
... sailor ripley ... can i talk to lula ?
of what ? i 'll be unconscious .
the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath , because it 's work , correct ? but if alternating current 's running through the wires every second of every day , and i throw a switch , send it here instead of there , how is that lighting a fire ?
so you drink , and you fight with a cop ... ?
you find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes .
he 'll be here soon .
quincy ...
i will , do n't worry .
did you find the knife , sergeant ?
do n't hurt no one .
well , ai n't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere ! forget it ! just the dozen hairnets !
you really love me , do n't you ?
son ?
the blender ?
it 's not ergot , it 's not pituitary extract , it 's not oil of rue ...
do what ?
yes .
you mentioned that in your letters
i swear to you they 've done everything humanly possible . the best plastic surgeons in the world , ben . you had the best --
no , jeff . you do n't . he 's not a murderer , i tell you . he ; s not a murderer .
what are you supposed to do ?
good .
what choice do we have ?
david . there 's a call for you . it 's your wife .
hey ! uh , how do i get back in ?
geologists ? at a plane crash ?
he only died two weeks ago -- i 'm sure they 'll still have him . hurry now . i 'll prepare the body .
would you like something to drink ?
that 's right .
i was talking to mr. carpenter .
looks that way .
uncle louis , this is my friend johana .
then -- in the name of kindness to dumb animals -- we ca n't let him walk into that senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose ! a couple of us went up there -- told him all he could do was beat it -- resign -- clear out . but -- he 's in a daze -- he 's been hit by a ton of bricks . just says , `` i have n't done anything . why should i resign ? '' he might *listen* to *you* --
`` it 's why the witch kills children . ''
why , you bully . i believe you would .
i know . and he 's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail .
yes .
